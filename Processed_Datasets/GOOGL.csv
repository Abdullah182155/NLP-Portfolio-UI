I'd now like to turn the conference over to Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Alphabet's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai. Now I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward looking including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures.
These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K for 2017 filed with the SEC. Undue reliance should not be placed on any forward-looking statements and they are made based on assumptions as of today. We undertake no obligation to update them.
During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. As you know we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. This call is also being webcast from our IR website where a replay of the call will be available later today.
And now I'll turn the call over to Ruth. Thank you, Ellen. Our revenues in the third quarter continued to benefit from ongoing strength in mobile search with important contributions from YouTube, cloud and desktop search, resulting in consolidated revenues of $33.7 billion, up 21% year-on-year and up 22% in constant currency.
For today's call, I will begin with the results for the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet focusing on year-over-year changes. I will then review results for Google followed by Other Bets and will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights after which we will take your questions.
Starting with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter, our total revenues of $33.7 billion reflect a negative currency impact year-over-year of $385 million or $305 million after the impact of our hedging program.
Turning to Alphabet revenues by geography, you can see that our performance was strong again in all regions. U.S. revenues were $15.5 billion, up 20% year-over-year. EMEA revenues were $11 billion, up 20% year-over-year. In constant currency terms EMEA grew 19%. APAC revenues were $5.4 billion, up 29% versus last year and up 30% in constant currency. Other Americas revenues were $1.8 billion, up 19% year-over-year and up 28% in constant currency, reflecting weakening of the Brazilian real and the Argentine peso.
On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues including TAC, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results, was $14.3 billion, up 28% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $7.7 billion, up 36% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses. The key drivers were costs associated with our data centers and other operations including depreciation which continue to be affected by a reallocation of certain operating expenses and content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube.
Operating expenses were $11.1 billion, up 26% year-over-year. Once again the biggest increase was in R&D expenses, reflecting our continued investment in technical talent. The growth in sales and marketing expenses reflects increases in sales and marketing head count primarily for cloud and ads followed by advertising investments in cloud, Chromebooks for the back-to-school season and the Google Assistant.
G&A expense trends in the third quarter were affected by a number of factors. In particular, the performance fees accrued in connection with recognition of equity security gains which were again partially offset by the reallocation of certain expenses from G&A primarily to other cost of revenues.
Stock-based compensation totaled $2.2 billion. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 94,372, up 5,314 from last quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable head count increases were in cloud for both technical and sales roles.
Operating income was $8.3 billion, up 7% versus last year for an operating margin of 25%. As discussed in the previous two quarters, both operating income and OI&E are affected by the new accounting standard that changes the way companies account for equity security investments. This new standard continues to result in greater volatility. Once again, we've provided a table in our earnings press release to highlight the impact on particular line items.
Other income and expense was $1.8 billion which includes $1.4 billion of gains in equity security investments. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release.
Our effective tax rate was 8.8% for the third quarter, reflecting discrete items, notably an adjustment associated with the U.S. Tax Act. Net income was $9.2 billion and earnings per diluted share were $13.06.
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $5.3 billion which I'll discuss in the Google segment results. Operating cash flow was $13.2 billion with free cash flow of $7.9 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $106 billion.
Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google segment. Revenues were $33.6 billion, up 21% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenues were $24.1 billion in the quarter, up 22% year-over-year.
In terms of dollar growth, results were led again by mobile search, with a strong contribution from YouTube followed by desktop search. Network revenues were $4.9 billion, up 13% year-on-year reflecting the ongoing momentum of AdMob and programmatic.
Other revenues for Google were $4.6 billion, up 29% year-over-year fueled by cloud and Play. We continue to provide monetization metrics in our earnings press release to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses.
Total traffic acquisition costs were $6.6 billion or 23% of total advertising revenues and up 20% year-over-year. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was relatively flat year-over-year, primarily reflecting a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites, offset by an increase in the sites' TAC rate. The increase in the sites' TAC rate year-over-year was driven by changes in partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC. This quarter, we experienced a year-on-year decline in the network TAC rate due to a combination of factors, none of which were individually significant.
Google stock-based compensation totaled $2.1 billion for the quarter, up 23% year-over-year. Operating income was $9.5 billion, up 11% versus last year. And the operating margin was 28.2%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $5.6 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, data center construction and facilities.
Let me now turn to Other Bets. Revenues were $146 million, primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. Operating loss was $727 million. Other Bets' accrued CapEx was $55 million. In terms of Other Bet updates for the quarter, with Waymo in the third quarter, we built on our early rider program, both expanding the group of participants and beginning to test pricing models.
At Verily, the team continues to execute on its various partnerships with leading pharmaceutical companies, consistent with its mission to move medicine from reactive to proactive. Recently launched efforts include a joint venture with ResMed to focus on sleeping disorders and a research collaboration with Gilead.
Finally, you can see in our results the benefit and quality of our investment teams GV and CapitalG which are also within Other Bets. Within the $1.4 billion of reported gains in equity securities in OI&E, approximately $400 million was realized in Q3. There will be more detail on these investment activities in the 10-Q.
Let me close with some observations on the quarter and our longer-term outlook. First, with respect to revenues. In the third quarter, results reflect FX headwinds with U.S. dollar strengthening in contrast to the tailwinds that enhanced reported results in the first half of the year. We continue to be pleased with the underlying momentum in our advertising businesses as we apply our strength in machine learning to improve the experience for users and advertisers. As we noted, hardware was only a modest contributor in the third quarter as we launched a new Made by Google family of products for the fourth quarter holiday season.
Second, with respect to profitability, within cost of revenues, the biggest component is TAC. We indicated on the fourth quarter 2017 call that the pace of year-on-year growth in sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenues would begin to slow after the first quarter of 2018, and you can see that again clearly in our results this quarter. As frequently discussed, we do expect the sites TAC rate to continue to increase year-on-year reflecting ongoing strength in mobile search. Looking ahead, we expect seasonal impacts to our other cost of sales from hardware sales which are typically higher in the fourth quarter of the year as well as from increased content acquisition costs for YouTube, which have also historically been higher in the fourth quarter.
Within OpEx, we continue to prioritize our investments to support long-term growth. In terms of head count, growth was seasonally higher in the third quarter because we brought on new graduates. We are continuing to invest in adding talent to our priority areas, particularly for technical roles in engineering and product management and to support our most sizable growth areas, in particular, cloud.
As I've mentioned previously regarding sales and marketing, expenses are more heavily weighted toward the back half of the year. As you have seen in prior years, these expenses are particularly elevated in the fourth quarter to support the holiday season.
Other Bets remains a portfolio of earlier stage businesses focused on addressing sizable markets. We are moving toward early stages of commercialization, while continuing to calibrate the pace of investment against achievement of key milestones.
And finally, with respect to CapEx, you can see our continued investment as we build the infrastructure needed to support the opportunities we see across our businesses. This includes a number of datacenter construction projects in flight as well as ongoing expansion in our compute capacity.
I will now turn the call over to Sundar. Thanks, Ruth. We had a great quarter, and it was particularly special because last month, we celebrated Google's 20th birthday and the 10th birthday of Chrome. It's exciting to think that 20 years in, we are still just at the beginning of what's possible. We get billions of questions from users every day and about 15% of those are queries we have never seen before.
Our mission to make the world's information accessible and useful is as relevant today as when we started. I want to begin by highlighting our recently launched family of hardware. It's a great example of how we bring together Google's strengths to help people through their day. Then I'll touch on ways AI is helping us approach our mission. I'll give an update on our video and advertising platforms. And finally, I'll talk about our growing cloud business.
First, hardware. Every year, we have a new opportunity to push the boundaries of computing. Those experiences come to life in our Made by Google hardware, which combines the latest advances in software, hardware and AI. Our third generation is our best yet. It includes the Pixel 3, Google Home Hub, the Pixel Slate tablet and more. We're getting great feedback, and I'm very excited for users to try these devices, especially as the holiday season approaches.
Our new hardware lineup showcases the best of Google, including the Google Assistant, Android and Chrome. With the Pixel 3, we've used AI to create a best-in-class camera. New features like top shot make it so you never miss a shot. If your timing wasn't perfect, the camera will suggest a better frame and give you the option to save it. And Night Sight will help you take really good pictures even in bad light.
Pixel 3 also has a custom security chip called Titan M. It was built to secure Google's own datacenters and now we are bring it to our users. We also released Google Home Hub, our first smart speaker with a screen. It shows your morning commute, lets you control your smartphone and gives you hand-free help in the kitchen, and Pixel Slate, Chrome OS reimagined as a tablet with all the great apps from the Play Store.
Our hardware efforts are picking up real momentum. For example, daily active users of our Google Home devices have grown by over 5x in the last year alone. I'm incredibly proud of our growing hardware team, including the talented employees who came over from HTC and Nest. Our investments are paying off as we bring the best of Google to more users and in more countries around the world.
Even as we build up our hardware business, we continue to advance our mission across our core products and platforms. Last month, we kicked off 20 years of Google search by introducing some of the biggest updates in many years. They include a new AI powered ranking approach that delivers more relevant results, a redesigned Google feed called Discover to help you stay informed on topics that matter to you and a new search experience for Google images.
We also continue to tackle the information problem of connecting people to relevant jobs right from search. This has already helped connect to over 100 million people in 92 countries to job listings that meet their needs and skills. Now U.S. service members can search for jobs for veterans and enter their military occupational code to see relevant civilian jobs.
The Google Assistant continues to gain traction, drawing on our strengths in machine learning and helpful Google services like search, YouTube and Maps. We have expanded the Assistant to 20 languages and 76 countries and it can now understand and speak more than one language at a time. We launched our first set of smart displays with Lenovo and JBL as well as our own Google Home Hub.
Pixel users in the U.S. will be the first to try our new duplex technology which helps you complete real-world tasks over the phone like calling a restaurant to book a table and we introduced a new way to easily book ride services with your Google Assistant. In Maps, we also made several improvements including a commute tab with live traffic and transit information and support for mixed-mode commutes.
Earlier this month, we announced an exciting test called Project Stream. We are working with video game publisher Ubisoft to stream their latest game, Assassin's Creed Odyssey to Chrome browsers on laptops and desktops. Streaming graphically rich content for video games represents a great technical advance and we look forward to seeing what's possible here.
I'm particularly proud of our strengths in AI are creating life-changing contributions in other fields. For example, our recent flood prediction efforts, which use AI to better predict when floods will occur had the potential to help millions of people get out of harm's way. We are starting in India, where 20% of flood-related fatalities occur today, and we're looking to expand to more countries soon.
Earlier this month, our research has showed how they've applied deep learning models to improve the accuracy of diagnosis for metastatic breast cancer. Our research found that pathologists and AI can work together more effectively than either alone.
Moving to our video and advertising platforms, which are creating economic opportunities for partners around the world. First YouTube. One particular area of focus is educational content. Every day people from all over the world turn to YouTube to learn something new from career skills to coding to cooking. Just this week, we announced a $20 million investment to expand our YouTube Learning initiative which will help fund established and emerging educational careers. We're also partnering with organizations like Goodwill and Year Up to create curated playlists that teach career skills directly in our new learning channel.
YouTube's Ask business continues to provide great results for marketers and creators. At Advertising Week, we announced that we'll be expanding our popular TrueView for actions format. This helps users take action directly from video ads. They can now do things like sign up for a newsletter and soon they'll be able to find movie show times, download apps or even book a trip right from the app. For creators, YouTube is continuing to build alternative revenue products like Super Chat, channel memberships and the ability to sell merchandise directly to fans.
YouTube gaming creator, Marquis player (19:55), increased its revenue by 20% using channel memberships. We continue to see positive traction for our newest subscription experiences too. YouTube Premium YouTube TV and YouTube Music Premium are continuing to expand to many new countries. The team is also investing in growing and improving the news experience on YouTube. More prominently surfacing credible news sources on the platform is a big priority for us.
Next, our advertising platforms. Advertisers love that we are bringing our machine learning strengths to offerings like responsive search ads and universal App Campaigns to create more effective ads. One new example is Smart Shopping Campaigns which use signals like seasonality and price to optimize where ads are shown. Tens of thousands of advertisers are using this and seeing an average of 20% more sales for the same budget.
Just last week we announced that Nike, Best Buy and Sephora are joining our Shopping Actions program. This allows people to move seamlessly from browsing to buying with a universal card that works across Google search and our system.
In apps, we announced a partnership with Unity Technologies, which gives our advertisers access to one of the largest global networks of mobile gaming titles across 1.5 billion devices. Unity's developers can monetize their apps with Google ads without any additional development work.
And lastly, our growing cloud business. At Google Cloud Next, we made over 100 announcements including the Titan security key, which features Google designed firmware to help verify that nothing on a customer's key has been tampered with. And we expanded our breakthrough Cloud AutoML portfolio, which now includes vision, natural language and translation.
And all over the world we are seeing great customer adoption of our Cloud Platform. With help of SAP, Metro, one of the largest B2B wholesalers globally, is centralizing their finance system on Google Cloud Platform. They're using BigQuery to generate data-driven insights to help create more personalized marketing campaigns.
In the U.S., we partnered with the National Institutes of Health to provide access to cloud services that help researchers access large datasets to accelerate biomedical advances. We also added new customers like ING and Broadcom, joining existing customers like PayPal, ANZ Bank and Kroger.
Our G Suite business continues to fuel transformation in companies large and small and we crossed two important milestones in the quarter. Google Drive became the eight Google product with 1 billion monthly active users. And Gmail now has more than 1.5 billion monthly active users.
One of our big wins in the quarter was Fast Retailing, the Japanese retailer best known for its popular brand UNIQLO, which is migrating its employees globally to G Suite, while also pursuing AI solutions like on-demand forecasting on Google Cloud Platform. Our cloud business is benefiting from our investments in technical infrastructure including a U.S.-Europe cable that will improve speeds for millions of people.
Before I wrap up, I want to quickly call out our continued momentum in Asia as well as the investments that we are making in the U.S. As you can see from our results, revenue growth in APAC remains strong. This is a reflection of our very focused efforts to build great experiences for the billions of people across the region. We have adapted many of our core products like search, Maps and YouTube to work well for the next generation of users coming online.
We're also building products to meet the specific needs of users in the region like Tez, a digital payments app for India, to help people easily pay their electrician or split it in a bill with just a few taps. Just one year since it launched, over 30 million people in businesses across India now use the app every month and they've collectively made more than 1 billion transactions. We have recently rebranded the app to Google Pay as we look to bring many of the app's features to others around the world.
We are also investing closer to home. In Q3, more than 80% of Alphabet's total capital expenditures was within the U.S. Not only do these investments in datacenters, machines and offices allow us to provide great services to users, they have a strong positive impact on the communities around them, supporting thousands of jobs and countless local businesses. This year-to-date we have added over 9,000 new employees in the U.S. and we continue to grow faster outside the Bay Area than in it.
As you can see, there's exciting momentum across many different areas. I'm constantly struck by the number of incredible opportunities ahead of us as a company and how far we have come over the last 20 years. I want to say a big thank you to all of Googlers around the world who help us deliver on that mission every day.
With that, I'll hand it back to Ruth. Thank you, Sundar, and we will now take your questions. And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two for Sundar if I can. Referencing the blog post and some of the changes about how you see the future of search, I wanted to know what some of the key investments you think the company needs to make so that search becomes more visual or relevant and what that might mean tying it back to the business for engagement with your products relevant to that medium to long term.
And then with respect to your comments on YouTube, we're starting to hear from advertisers that there is some blurring between brand and direct response ad budgets as they look at products maybe more across blended lines. It sounds like the YouTube announcements coming out of Adweek were about making YouTube more responsive or more direct response. How are you thinking about the blurring of those lines and what it means for product development long term? Thanks so much. Thanks, Eric. I'll take the two. The first on search. You're right that search, we are always trying to anticipate what the user experience expectations are and trying to meet them there. And increasingly in mobile, people do want immersive engaging experiences. They want their experiences to be more visual and that's partly what you saw us announce in our 20th birthday event. And we are excited to move in that direction.
And I do think we have a lot of important assets to bring here. YouTube is a big part of what we do. We are investing in image search and we do have products like Google Maps and Photos which all add to the visual experience. And as part of doing that, we are investing in our advertising offerings as well. And so over time, we'll adapt that so they go hand-in-hand. But I think it's an important evolution for us.
In terms of YouTube, I think part of what makes YouTube great is I think we can offer different opportunities for advertisers. We've always felt direct response is something that can work well on YouTube. And our instinct is bearing out. And I look at my personal use cases that are many times now sometimes instead of search, actually find something I want to do in YouTube, maybe thinking about going to a place. And I research it on YouTube. So I think it offers the same opportunity over time. And from our standpoint, we want to make sure that we are evolving the product to bring those opportunities to advertisers. So I'm very excited by it. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Good afternoon, everyone. Sundar, two questions for you. First, earlier this month or it might have been late last month, Sridhar Ramaswamy, your Head of Ads and Commerce left to go to a VC firm. I'm betting that wasn't a surprise to you, but I'm just hoping you could shed a little light on sort of succession planning for that important role and whether or not you expect any sort of broad changes to ad product strategy.
And then second, just amongst those announcements on the anniversary were the evolution of Feed to Discover. And I recognize that's an evolution of a product, but it does look like you're taking advantage of that long unused white space on google.com. And so, just love to hear a little bit more, just sort of a follow-up on Eric's question on the evolution of search, but how you see that surface in particular evolving and particularly the potential for ad monetization over time. Thanks. Good. On the first one, look I mean we, one of the things I'm really proud about Google is we have a deep bench of talent and for example in the ads team almost all of our senior ads leadership has been here for well over a decade. And so for us, we are fortunate to be able to tap into it.
Our ads leadership comes – Prabhakar who has taken over our ads product and engineering efforts, someone I worked with for many, many years, and most recently has led our G Suite business, but has done many roles before, is a deep computer scientist. And I expect to, for him to continue our tradition of technical excellence with the – approach our advertising work. Also want to mentioned Philip and his team, his extraordinary team, who definitely lead many of our initiatives here. And Philip and Prabhakar, with them I think it's in great hands. And I expect a lot of continuity there.
On your question on search and Discover, it's in addition to making search more visual, one of the things we are very, very focused on is not always do users turn to us and actually ask a question. So we feel our job is to be there when users need us, anticipate what they want and sometimes proactively meet them. That's where services like Discover really play a role. Right? And I think we are thinking hard about how we can surface relevant information for our users, stuff they are really looking for, can act on, in a way in which it's delightful for them and is showing up for them when they need it.
So I see that as an important evolution of search as well. And so you're going to see us investing more. Mobile offers us a great opportunity. And if you use it in Pixel 3, that's the latest product in which we bring our vision of how to bring all these products together and we'll give you a good sense of how we plan to do that over time. Great. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Great. Thank you for taking my questions. First for Sundar, you spent some time on hardware. You spent time discussing your suite of hardware devices, the Google Assistant, the Pixel. How are you measuring the returns on those investments in hardware, both in the products and on the marketing side here in a pretty competitive marketplace? What are the milestones for success that we should be looking for on hardware?
And then for Ruth, as we start to look ahead to 2019, as you plan for 2019, how are you thinking about the relationship between revenue growth and dollars of operating income growth for next year, particularly if the macroeconomic environment were to become, let's say, less of a tailwind to the broader ads environment as it was this year and in prior years? Thank you. On hardware, we always want to be at the forefront of computing. And so, and a lot of times that involves thinking across the whole stack, bringing together the entire experience in an integrated way for our users. And we genuinely see a very differentiated way to do this. We think of our approach of bringing together AI software and hardware is unique and we think we can deliver the best-in-class experience and we are committed to doing it. At the same time, we want to build a great business here as well. So we are investing in the long run because we see it clearly as an important business opportunity for us as well, so both go hand-in-hand.
We closely look at metrics, and the metrics we have been very focused on for the last couple of years. This is our third generation of hardware. It's the first time we actually are doing our products end-to-end, and we've expanded to newer categories. We look at user feedback and reception. We measure NPS scores. And our scores are now reflecting best-in-class in the category. And beyond that, we're looking at how the market adoption is and we are thoughtfully building a business but we are committed to building and investing for the long run. And in terms of how we're thinking about planning, we're in the middle of it now. And many of the questions sort of been already asked sort of point to the direction that we feel really good about the underlying strength in the ads business as we've talked about on numerous calls. We continue to invest here because we see ongoing opportunities in particular as we leverage machine learning to provide better experience for users and for advertisers. And some of the comments that Sundar made about the opportunities that open up with visual search again continue to point the direction direct response, continue to point to some of the underlying areas in which we're focused.
But as we've talked about on prior calls, that's one element of it, and we continue to invest for opportunities that are sizable over the long term. Sundar has already commented on both hardware and cloud as really important examples, and we think the steps that we're taking, the investments we're making, provide the foundational support for ongoing long-term sustained growth. And so then we marry that with the second part of your question, which is in how do we think about the pace of investment. As we've said repeatedly, we're very focused on investing for the long term. We're trying to make sure that we prioritize crisply across the opportunity set that we have and we make the right types of trade-offs but we do remain focused on long-term investing given the scale of the opportunities that we see. Got it, thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Thanks. Two questions please. One, Sundar, could you just update us with your thinking on China and the China market and the extent. I know Google is already in that market, but the extent to which you want to expand, re-expand your presence there with search.
And then in terms of Waymo, just a quick question. Commercialization of Waymo, do you know when, do you have a sense of when you'll have pricing established and you'll have a roughly well-defined and acted on go-to-market strategy with Waymo? Is that the end of this year, beginning of next year, whenever? Thank you. And, Mark, on China, we obviously, we deeply care about serving Chinese users. We've been investing for many years and especially from developing Android. But more recently, we have launched mobile apps such as Google Translate and Files Go and improved our developer tools there. So we are constantly looking for ways by which we can better serve Chinese users. And that's where we are today. And then in terms of Waymo, in the third quarter, as I think you know, we extended our Early Rider Program to a larger group and we moved into very early days of commercialization. So we do now have people paying for rides and we're also testing pricing models.
I think the main point, we've said this repeatedly is that, we are intently focused on safety first and ensuring a great user experience. And so what that means is, we're really expanding the program methodically. We're taking an iterative approach as we continue to broaden the geographic footprint.
And then on top of that, as we've talked about on prior calls, we've been developing the B2B opportunity. So in Phoenix, as an example, we've been piloting with several partners who are sponsoring a service on behalf of their employees and customers. And again it's early days. So small revenues, but we're pleased to be testing this out as well, and then on top of that continuing to explore applying our technology for logistics and deliveries and for personal use vehicles and for last mile solutions for cities. So you can see a move in the third quarter. But as we said repeatedly, it's very early days and we are taking a very deliberate iterative approach to broadening it out. Thank you, Ruth. Thank you, Sundar. Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one on map monetization and putting some more ads in the map. Can you just talk about sort of early learnings there? I know you talked about local mobile searches growing quite rapidly in the past. But any early learnings from the monetization and the return that advertisers are getting on that front?
And the second one on video games and Project Stream. Could you just talk a little about how you think about the gaming opportunity for Alphabet, and what you think are the key factors you need to tackle to really build and scale direct-to-consumer facing cloud gaming product. Look, on the ad stuff, we've had ad formats in Maps for some time and we are constantly working to make it more useful and relevant. But I wouldn't underestimate the focus we have on local. Just to give you a sense, local mobile searches are growing faster than just mobile searches overall, and have increased by almost 50% in the last year.
So for us, that's an important focus area and Maps plays a big role there. So we recently announced Local campaigns, which is a new campaign type specifically designed to drive foot traffic to local businesses, right. And it's going to roll out in the coming months. And so that is a big focus.
And as you pointed out, we are definitely launching and experimenting with newer ad formats on Maps itself. We have promoted places which appears on the map itself. We have place page ads which appear on Google listings in Maps and search. But we are definitely in the phase of putting those, testing it out, making sure the user experience works and making sure we can deliver value for advertisers. We are being patient here because the opportunity in local search, it's a big opportunity and we are focused there.
On your second question, look, we today serve our users on gaming across Google ads but in many ways, right. Obviously, Google Play does this a lot. It's a big important vertical on YouTube. And so we touch with gaming developers across many areas already. And so we are thoughtfully thinking about what more we can do there.
And Project Stream, having spent my life on computing. I was blown away by seeing our ability to stream a game which needs real-time interactions and to be able to do that from the cloud. And it's one of the most important technological advances I've seen in a while. And so we are going to focus on that and make sure we are making progress there and bring newer experiences for gamers. Great. Thanks. Thank you. And our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Thanks for taking the questions. One for Sundar, one for Ruth. Sundar, can you help us better understand how the remedy in Europe will work in terms of licenses and TAC going forward? And what impact do see that having on financials? And then Ruth, can you just talk about where you are in the hardware replacement cycle in your datacenters? Pretty major step up this year just given that large ramp. How are you thinking about the trajectory into 2019? Thank you. Thanks, Doug. On Europe, I mean it's early to say. We'll begin only implementing the remedy in the next few weeks. But in all these cases, we always, we're focused on complying with the commission's directive and we want to make sure that the transition for both our users and our OEM partners is as smooth as possible.
In this case you're dealing with life cycles for mobile phones. So changes is going to take some time to reach users. And it's difficult to predict how the licensing model will be adopted. But our products are very popular with users across platforms. And so it's early to say but we're focused on doing the right thing there. And then in terms of technical infrastructure and our CapEx as we talked about last quarter, CapEx reflects our view of the growing opportunity set in our core ads and search businesses as well as the longer-term opportunities in newer businesses in particular to support cloud. And then very importantly, as we've talked about machine learning across Alphabet.
And we're particularly excited about the opportunity with machine learning, because it opens up more services and products for users and for advertisers and for enterprise customers. And so given our view about the long-term potential with these opportunities, we're very focused on ensuring that we have the needed compute capacity to support growth. And that's what you're really seeing with the uptick in investment.
To give you a bit of a breakdown, the largest component continues to be machines. But relative to last year, it's important to note that datacenter construction is an increasing percentage of our CapEx investment. And so we're now in various stages of developing more than 20 datacenter sites globally. We're also investing in network infrastructure such as undersea cables so we can deliver speed and quality. So again this really goes to our view of the opportunity set.
That being said, we do remain very focused on optimizing the use of CapEx and also on compute efficiency. We're very mindful of the fact that our decisions here on CapEx don't just result in CapEx spend but also translate into higher depreciation expenses and that goes both to cost of sales and OpEx. So very careful about how we're using it, but I want to make sure that we've built for the requirements that we have.
And as much as you asked about technical infrastructure, just a quick note that our facility spend, namely real estate, was more muted this quarter and it was primarily just the ongoing work on our ground up development. So you're primarily seeing what's going on, on technical infrastructure here. Great. Thank you both. Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Barclays. Your line is now open. Great. Two questions. Ruth, so you guys posted pretty solid growth all around. But if we look at some of the international markets, each geography had a tougher comp and decelerated a little bit on a currency-neutral basis. So, I guess, stepping that high level, the growth rates are solid. But can you give us any color on the overall macro picture here? I think we're getting mixed feedback from different companies across different sectors. So any high-level comments would be helpful on just the ad market given that you're close to 20% of global advertising ex-China.
And then, Sundar, question on I guess Pixel and just the overall advance that you're seeing in smartphone devices. So as you guys roll out more products like Lens and Gboard and some of these other utilities on top of your 1 billion-plus apps like search and YouTube, is there any way to parse out what the overall engagement looks like in markets like the U.S. and Western Europe when the phones are improving their functionality and can you keep adding these additional utilities? Is query volume going up on a per user basis? Any color there will be helpful. So in terms of your first question, we actually felt pretty good about the strength globally, which as I noted in opening comments, across the board, 20% growth in the U.S. on a $15 billion base. As Sundar noted, what's going on in APAC, 30% year-on-year growth. It's now over a $5 billion revenue business and we've had sustained quarter after quarter growth at this kind of 30%-ish area, feel really good about that.
And by country, it really does reflect broad-based strength. As he said, we're very focused on the region. And I think we're delivering terrific products and experiences in rapidly growing markets. You see the same thing in other Americas, neutralizing for currency movements, 28% year-on-year growth. So we're really proud of what the teams are doing around the globe. And on your second question, one of the things we clearly see when we make a hardware product like Pixel, in which all the tools and the utilities we build are conveniently there integrated and the experience is great. We definitely see users engaging more. And so, we see an opportunity. And that's one of the bigger reasons why we do hardware as well, to show that into an experience, both for our ecosystem as well as for us. It helps us give users a much deeper engaged experience as well. And when you look at all our products, we see that. And so, we do see that as an opportunity. Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open. Thanks. I have two for Sundar, kind of the same theme. One is on the Pixel 3. The marketing message is clear. The product looks great. But I wonder, when you look at to date the success ramping the product, what's been the gating factor? Has it been the carriers? Has it been the price? And we look at the factors for why it hasn't scaled as much as the product should have a scaled, what are the factors?
And then on Verily, you called out some deals you've had with big pharmaceutical companies this quarter. But again there I wonder, who's your most natural partnership? Is it hospitals, insurance, governments? So we think about the big opportunity, where is the most natural fit to drive Verily going forward? On Pixel, look, first of all, part of the big thing is this is our third generation of hardware. Each generation, first of all, we've been scaling up the product in terms of even the number of units we can make and so on. So if you remember the first couple generations were struggling to meet the early demand we saw. This is the first year we have done it end-to-end and we are ramping up from there. And so each year when I look at all the metrics, be it NPS or be it our sales, be it our reviews, etcetera, everything is progressing well.
But there are, you're right, the gating factors to ramp this up, first of all is to be able to build the supply we need. And second is go-to-market, getting ourselves in as many locations in retail as possible, in as many countries as possible with as many carrier certifications as possible. So in each of those dimensions, we are making progress as well. In terms of Verily, what we've talked about there is, they have partnered with a whole host of leading pharmaceutical companies focusing on specific diseases, whether it's diabetic retinopathy or across the board for neurological diseases. I announced a couple of new partnerships, the ResMed arrangement as well as Gilead. And that's what they tend to do. They partner with best-in-class to focus on specific areas where working with the pharmaceutical companies they can, and the technology we have, and benefiting from machine learning, we can really move from reactive to proactive care. That's the Verily focus. Thanks, Ruth. Thanks, Sundar. Thank you. And the next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Great. Thank you. I just wanted to focus on cloud a little bit more. Sundar, you gave some good color in your prepared remarks. But I'm wondering if you could share with us an update maybe on the partner momentum and direct sales momentum you're seeing in the market, how you've seen that change?
And also if you could highlight, if you've noticed if there's been noticeable changes in win rates over the last year as the product continues to mature. And you, also in the beginning of the year and exiting Q4, you would give us some high-level growth commentary about GCP. and I'm just wondering if you have anything else you could share? Thank you. Thanks, Heather. Look, overall I mean it's now we've been doing this seriously at the next level for three years. And we are definitely seeing strong indicators that are the investment in product is clearly beginning to work. Our value proposition does come through in many competitive situations. I've seen many important wins in what seemed like very, very competitive situations.
I also don't, from the way we see it, it doesn't look like a zero-sum game as you know. We're addressing a large market opportunity here. It seems like very early days. And more importantly, the general sense I get is, we're very aligned with where the market is headed in the long run. And this notion of supporting open architecture so that enterprises don't feel locked in and allowing for a multi-cloud environment to develop. That's the direction we are betting on and our indications are that the market is headed in that direction as well. So that gives us a lot of comfort. That gives us a lot of comfort as well.
And on-the-go to market side, we have really ramped up both in terms of our investments, our direct investments, but also our partnership strategy is beginning to work. And when I look at the pipeline ahead that's we are clearly seeing momentum there as well. In this business, obviously the enterprise business plays in a way in which you do have wins, but those accounts turn into larger revenue deals over time. And so it's very clear to us that we are laying the foundation and we are getting the strong early momentum. And that's the big reason why we are investing in a strong way in the area. And over time, we'll obviously share more here as well. And could I just ask one follow-up if possible? I was just wondering if you look at Microsoft, they have a on-premise and cloud strategy. If you look at Amazon ,what they're doing with AWS and VMware, they're kind of doing a similar strategy. Do you think there's a requirement for you to also have an on-premise strategy to solve this hybrid world as long as it's hybrid for? Thank you. We are thoughtfully looking at it. I mean we are increasingly working with partners like, for example our partnership from SAP or Pivotal, VMware, these are all on hybrid cloud solutions. And so we are thinking about how to do that better. and our overall approach to cloud hybrid modernization I think is the right long-term direction and so we are doing that. And there are many, many situations we are in where on-prem is a big, big, big requirement for customers, but with our partnership approach, we've been able to address the needs well. So, I don't see that as a gating issue for us. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Thanks. Ruth, I just wanted to see if you could quantify the FX headwind. I think it was a negative 1% for Q3 and in Q4, do you anticipate it to be similar or a little worse? I will let you forecast the dollar. As you noted, it was 1 point here. We went from a tailwind in the second quarter to a 1 point drag here going forward. But we called out that and we'll have more in the Q, but noted the impact, for example, a pretty big delta between our reported and fixed and other Americas, 19% to 28% growth and that was really what was going on with the Brazilian real and the Argentine peso. We saw some movements in other currencies around the globe, but you can see that, which is why we broke out the geography the way we've done it a number of quarters ago to try and give you, help give a better sense of the types of headwinds and I'll let you forecast the dollar. Okay, we look forward to that. Real quick just on EMEA, you were flat on your constant currency growth, 19%, 19% the last two quarters despite with GDPR. So, I would believe that would suggest that you're probably not seeing as big a headwind perhaps as maybe some expect. Could you just talk to the European business and what you're seeing there? Look, I mean specifically, I think if your question is around GDPR and so on, first of all, I mean we've always been as a company very, very focused on user privacy and security. And so in some ways we were very early on, engaged on GDPR and we worked very hard to make sure our products are ready in in compliance. We've generally always approached our products with a strong privacy lens for our users. So, and I think that helps us work through these changes, because I don't think they are at odds with what we are trying to accomplish. I think GDPR is a very good and comprehensive set of regulations. And so I think it's been good to see a smooth transition on our products and for our users. We're continuing to invest significantly in Europe, because we see the opportunity across Europe and are investing in the communities in which we're working. Thank you. Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Justin Post of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Great, thank you. One quick one for Ruth. People are really asking about Amazon. Just wondering if your e-commerce vertical was any difference versus your other verticals in the quarter. Anything to call out there?
And then secondly, Sundar, a lot of interesting things going on with YouTube and Waymo and cloud and other areas. As you look out two or three years, do you think any of these businesses could really make a financial positive difference on the bottom line for overall Google? Thank you. Look, I mean, I think on the first thing on e-commerce, maybe really in people, we do see a lot of activity in the vertical on our products, and we see strong growth there as well. We see is an important use case and that's why we are investing a lot. And if you look at our recent work with Shopping Actions, that's an example of the kind of work we are doing there.
And when we do those things, we clearly see users respond. Like for example, on Shopping Actions I think we just recently had partnerships with Best Buy and Nike and Sephora, I mentioned it earlier. So we are continuing to invest there and we are also driving strong partnerships with the retail sector, both in terms of our shopping experiences as well as through cloud. And I think that continues to be a big opportunity.
And on your broader question, look, the reason we are investing across Google and Alphabet in a set of areas is because as a company over the past 20 years, we have developed deep capabilities in technology, in computer science and especially with machine learning and AI. And we see an opportunity to apply that across a set of important areas. There are a lot of opportunities ahead of us. We are pretty disciplined about where we focus on and we're focused on real large opportunities. And when you mention areas like YouTube and Waymo and cloud and hardware, they all fit the category. But we take a very long-term view. And we want to investigate the user experience right. And we're pretty confident that when we do that, the value will follow. Thank you, Sundar. Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ellen West for closing remarks. Thanks everyone for joining us today.

[Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the conference over to Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. … fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai.
Now I'll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business performance and operations and our expected level of capital expenditures may be considered forward looking and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC.
During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations Web site located at abc.xyz/investor.
And now I'll turn the call over to Ruth. Thank you, Ellen. We have a strong 2018, with total revenues of $136.8 billion, up 23% over 2017, reflecting the benefit of our ongoing investments to deliver exceptional experiences for users and compelling returns for our advertisers, partners and enterprise customers.
For the fourth quarter, revenues of $39.3 billion or up 22% year-on-year and up 23% in constant currency, as we continue to benefit from ongoing strength in mobile search with important contributions from YouTube, Cloud and Desktop Search.
For today's call, I will begin with a review of results for the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet focusing on year-over-year changes. I will then review results for Google followed by Other Bets, and will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights after which we will take your questions.
Let me start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter: our total revenues of $39.3 billion reflect a negative currency impact year-over-year of $724 million or $600 million after the impact of our hedging program.
Turning to Alphabet revenues by geography, you can see that our performance was strong again in all regions: U.S. revenues were $18.7 billion, up 21% year-over-year. EMEA revenues were $12.4 billion, up 20% year-over-year in both reported and constant currency terms with a slight headwind primarily from the euro.
APAC revenues were $6.1 billion, up 29% versus last year and up 32% in constant currency, reflecting weakness of the Australian dollar. Other Americas revenues were $2.2 billion, up 16% year-over-year and up 26% in constant currency, reflecting weakening of the Brazilian real and the Argentine peso.
On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues including TAC, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results, was $17.9 billion, up 26% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $10.5 billion, up 34% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses.
The key drivers were: first, content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, mostly for our advertising supported content in what is a seasonally strong quarter for YouTube, but also for our newer subscription businesses, YouTube Premium and YouTube TV which have higher CAC as a percentage of revenues. Second, costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation and, third, hardware related costs for our made by Google and Nest family of products.
Operating expenses were $13.2 billion, up 27% year-over-year. The biggest increase was in R&D expenses, with the larger driver being headcount growth, followed by the accrual of compensation expenses to reflect increases in the valuation of equity in certain Other Bets. Growth in Sales and marketing expenses reflect increases in sales and marketing headcount primarily for Cloud and Ads followed by advertising investments mainly in Search and the Assistant. The growth in G&A expenses reflects mostly increases in headcount.
Stock-based compensation totaled $2.3 billion. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 98,771, up 4,399 from last quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable head count increases were in Cloud for both technical and sales roles.
Operating income was $8.2 billion, up 7% versus last year for an operating margin of 21%. Other income and expense was $1.9 billion, which includes $1.3 billion of unrealized gain related to a non-marketable debt security investment. We provide more detail on these line items within OI&E in our earnings press release.
Our effective tax rate was 11.2% for the fourth quarter, reflecting a discrete benefit due to the reversal of an accrual made as a result of updated guidance associated with the U.S Tax Act. Net income was $8.9 billion and earnings per diluted share were $12.77.
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $7.1 billion, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results. Operating cash flow was $13 billion with free cash flow of $5.9 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $109 billion.
Let me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with the Google segment. Revenues were $39.1 billion, up 22% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenues were $27 billion in the quarter, up 22% year-over-year. In terms of dollar growth, results were led again by mobile search, with a strong contribution from YouTube followed by desktop search. Network revenues were $5.6 billion, up 12% year-on-year reflecting the ongoing momentum of AdMob and Google Ad Manager.
Other revenues for Google were $6.5 billion, up 31% year-over-year fueled by Cloud, Hardware and Play. We continue to provide monetization metrics in our earnings press release to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses.
Total traffic acquisition costs were $7.4 billion or 23% of total advertising revenues and up 15% year-over-year. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was down year-over-year, primarily reflecting a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites. The increase in the sites' TAC rate year-over-year was driven by the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC, followed by changes in partner agreements offset by the seasonally higher proportion of YouTube advertising revenues in the fourth quarter.
In Q4, the network TAC rate declined year-on-year, primarily due to our revenue mix shift within our programmatic business. Google stock-based compensation totaled $2.1 billion for the quarter, up 22% year-over-year. Operating income was $9.7 billion, up 13% versus last year and the operating margin was 24.8%.Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $6.8 billion, reflecting investments in office facilities, datacenters, and servers.
Let me now turn to and talk about Other Bets. I'll cover results for the full-year 2018 because it remains most instructive to look at the financials for Other Bets over a longer-term horizon, as we've discussed on prior calls. Results for the quarter are in our earnings release.
For the full-year 2018, Other Bets revenues were $595 million, up 25% versus 2017 primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. Operating loss for Other Bets was $3.4 billion for the full-year 2018 versus an operating loss of $2.7 billion in 2017. Other Bets accrued CapEx was $181 million, down from $493 million in 2017 primarily reflecting investments in Fiber.
Key recent accomplishments include: in December, Waymo launched Waymo One, which enables participants to use its app to hail and pay for rides. Also Verily recently announced a $1 billion investment round led by Silver Lake as it advances on plans that are complementary and additive to its current life sciences portfolio. That investment of course was in addition to the $800 million it raised from Temasek previously.
Let me close with some observations on our priorities and longer-term outlook. First, with respect to revenues. Our 23% revenue growth in 2018 was powered in particular by the ongoing benefit of innovation in our Sites business. With eight products, with more than 1 billion users each and more people coming online every day, we remain excited by the opportunities to continue to create valuable experiences for users around the globe.
In particular, we see significant ongoing potential to apply our machine learning capabilities across our businesses. In our advertising business, machine learning has enabled innovation in advertisers ability to match consumer intent into bit more effectively for improved ROI. It has also enhanced the ability of smaller businesses to benefit from advertising on our platforms.
Machine learning is also driving differentiation for newer Google businesses, like Cloud and Hardware, as well as central to a number of Other Bets, most notably Waymo and Verily. Looking ahead, a couple of things to note. First, as we’ve said many times, we continuously work to enhance the user and advertiser experience because we make changes with a focus on the best interest of users and advertisers over the long-term, the timing of the introduction of new experiences, particularly, in search advertising can vary which can result in an impact on quarterly year-on-year growth.
Second, during 2018, the FX tailwinds in the first half of the year turn to headwinds in the third and fourth quarters, in line with the strengthening of the U.S dollar. Based on the continuing strengthening of the U.S dollar, we expect a headwind to reported versus fixed FX results in the first quarter, in contrast to the favorable impact of FX in the first quarter of 2018.
Turning to investments and profitability. In terms of gross margin, the biggest component within cost of revenues remains our traffic acquisition costs, reflecting our strong revenue growth in mobile search and the fact that mobile search carries higher TAC than our desktop business. As we've discussed on prior calls, while the pace of year-on-year growth in Sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenues, slowed after the first quarter of 2018. We do expect the Sites TAC rate to continue to increase year-on-year, reflecting ongoing strength in mobile search.
Within OpEx, we remain focused on prioritization in order to optimize resources for longer-term growth in sizable markets. You'll see us continue to support our priority areas with increased headcount, which will remain concentrated in R&D. Although we expect the growth rate to moderate in 2019. In 2018, we also saw continued progress on our goal to nurture new businesses outside of Google, our Other Bets with a model of independence.
While I've said previously that there is no monolithic approach to how the Other Bets execute against opportunities, a shared principle is aligning employee interest with the long-term value creation by these companies. Since inception, this has been an important part of our approach at Google with stock grants comprising a meaningful component of overall compensation across our employee days.
We are increasingly following that approach in the Other Bets with compensation programs that align employee and company interests. You’ve seen the impact of some of those programs in the fourth quarter as we accrued compensation expenses to reflect increases in the valuation of equity in certain Other Bets. While these expenses will recur, the timing evaluation events is unpredictable and can vary between debts which can affect quarterly comparisons.
Finally, on capital allocation. Our primary use continues to be to support organic growth in our businesses, followed by retaining flexibility for acquisitions. After taking these needs into account, our Board has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 12.5 billion of our Class C capital stock.
With respect to CapEx, we continue to invest in both compute requirements and for office facilities. Although we expect the CapEx growth rate in 2019 to moderate quite significantly. In conclusion, 2018 was another great year, with tremendous ongoing opportunity ahead of us.
I will now turn the call over to Sundar. Thanks, Ruth. Last year, we set out to bring the benefits of AI to everyone through our products. And I'm proud of the tremendous progress we made towards that goal. From smart compose and Gmail to the new Google news experience, to call screening on the pixel and improving the overall safety of our products. AI's helping people get things done every day. Beyond our products, AI is also helping us drive our mission forward at the scale we couldn’t have imagined just a few years ago.
Google Al Lead, Jeff Dean recapped the results of our efforts in a great post on our AI block. Accusing AI to better deduct the spread of breast cancer, or providing flood victims, with real-time information in a crisis. I encourage everyone to check it out.
We also launched the Google AI impact challenge to help nonprofits find ways to use AI to solve social and environmental problems. In addition to our progress in AI we saw great traction across newer areas, like the Google assistant, hardware, and Cloud. And our core area such as search maps new use YouTube under computing and advertising platforms continue their strong momentum.
Everything we do at Google is united by the mission of making information accessible and useful for everyone. Providing accurate and trusted information at the scale the internet has reached is an extremely complex challenge. And one that is constantly getting harder. But we’ve 20 years of experience in these information challenges, and it's what we strive to do better than anyone else.
As we do this, we feel a deep sense of responsibility to do the right thing and are continuing to build privacy and security into the core of our products, keeping uses data safe and secure with the industry's best security systems and giving people better and clearer controls. You will see us continue to do a lot more here in 2019.
Today I will start by sharing some of the new ways that we are working towards our mission. Then I will give an update on our video and advertising platforms, followed by the latest on our hardware and cloud efforts. And I will close with a few thoughts on our investments around the world. First, advancing our mission of making information accessible and useful. The Google assistant is a great example of how we help people throughout the day and we demonstrated that at CES last month with lots of exciting new partners and features.
From the Lenovo Smart Clock that wakes you up in the morning to real-time navigation that helps during your commute. To a build in interpreter that translates conversations across dozens of languages on Google home. And speaking of languages, over the past year the Google assistant expanded from eight languages and 14 countries to nearly 30 languages and 80 countries. In that time, the number of active users us quadruple. As we had more partners, devices and capabilities, the Google assistant will only get better and more helpful.
There's a lot of great progress in other areas too. Last month, we announced the launch of activity cards and search. Now when you search for a topic that you’ve previously explode, you can quickly see very of already being and pick up where you left off. Thanks to our strengths in AI and Search, Google Lens uses your smartphone camera to help identify more than 1 billion products. So if you see an item that you like, Lens can show you similar designs, along with useful information like product reviews.
We continue to see great momentum across our computing platforms, android and chrome. In Q4, we announced that android was officially support affordable phones that partners like Samson introducing their first portable devices this year. We see continued traction with manufacturer adoption of android auto. We recently announced new media and messaging features to significantly simplify and improve the car dashboard experience.
And building on the speed simplicity and security of chrome OS, partners like Asus and HP, introduced a slew of great consumer and enterprise Chromebooks last months at CES. Now let me provide an update on our video and advertising platforms, starting with YouTube.
We are seeing great traction in some of our newer experiences on YouTube. YouTube music and YouTube Premium are now available in nearly 30 countries up from five countries at the start of 2018. Last month, YouTube TV announced that it is expanded nationwide to cover 98% of U.S households with the rest to follow shortly. YouTube continues to invest in its thriving community of creators and build great features for its nearly 2 billion monthly log in users.
For instance in Q4, the expanded access to tools like stories and community polls that strengthen the connections between France and creators. One of our newest tools, Premiers, is a breakout hit. Ariana Grande's premiere of her official music video for Thank U, Next in November holds the record for biggest music video debut in YouTube history earning over $55 million views in its first day.
We are driving revenue to the YouTube creator community from established channels to newly emerging ones. The number of YouTube channels with more than 1 million subscribers nearly doubled in the last year, and the number of creators earning five or six figures grew by more than 40% year-over-year. A big priority for YouTube in 2019 is to continue our work to quickly find and remove content that violates YouTube's content guidelines.
It's an important challenge and with advanced machine learning and investments in human reviewers, we are making continued progress. Now I'll touch on some of the recent highlights of our advertising business, which continue to go from strength to strength. Recently, Warner Brothers embedded the first full-length film with an ad on YouTube and reached a record number of people.
Over 17 million users in a single day. Viewers who watch the trailer for LEGO Movie 2 on Black Friday, were served the franchise's original film for free within the Ad. So great example of how advertisers continue to delight users on YouTube. Performance advertisers love TrueView for action. YouTube's direct response offering. Since the product launch in March 2018 over 30% of the advertisers who use TrueView for action were new to buying inc and video ads on YouTube.
In Q4, we also announced a global strategic ad tech relationship with The Walt Disney Company across their entire portfolio of brands and properties. With Google Ad Manager as its core platform, Disney will be able to serve across its digital property seamlessly. On the web and mobile apps through connected TVs and even during live events.
Our shopping tools, that are also front and center during the holidays, helping retailers reach people during the busy holiday shopping season. In fact, the number of shopping daily active users on Google.com during the holidays, double compared to last year. Thanks and part to new features like product list modules that showcase the most popular products across the web.
Small retailers are also benefiting from automated bidding solutions like smart shopping campaigns, which now has more than 20,000 live merchants. Impressive progress since launching in April. Now on to our growing hardware efforts. During the holiday season, our newest line up of made by Google Devices top many best of 2018 looks. The response from shoppers was equally positive.
It was another record year for our Google home family of devices, with million sold this holiday season. They’re helping people easily get things done around the house. For example, people use Google home devices to cook over 16 million recipes this holiday season. 1 million on Christmas Day alone. Our newest smart displays were particularly popular. One out of every seven Google home devices activated or the holiday season was a Google home hub.
In Q4, we launched significant advances in computational photography in our pixel three with features such as night sight for lowlight photos. We’ve also expanded availability to four more countries: Japan, France, Ireland, and Taiwan. And finally, our growing cloud business. I want to thank Diane Greene for her leadership over the last three years.
Google Cloud is a fast-growing multibillion-dollar business that supports major global 5,000 companies in every important vertical with a robust enterprise organization. This was not the case just three years ago. What Diane and their team accomplished, it's phenomenal. Now Diane's work is done and she has handed the reins to Thomas Kurian, and I’m thrilled to have him here as our new Cloud leader.
Google Cloud closed out the strong year, with momentum across the business. Last year, we more than doubled both the number of Google Cloud platform deals over $1 million as well as the number of multiyear contracts signed. We also ended the year with another milestone, passing 5 million paying customers for our cloud collaboration and productivity solution G suite. Our focus on helping customers digitally transform their businesses is paying off.
We continue to see strong growth in all our major geographies and industries this quarter. In financial services, we signed agreements with two of the top financial institutions in the U.S to help them transition their business to Google Cloud with our highly secured solutions. In retail, brands like Bed Bath & Beyond, DSW and Ulta Beauty are using our cloud to manage data and provide more personalized experiences to consumer.
In Media and Entertainment, the telegraph and the U.K's going all in with Google Cloud because of our data and machine learning expertise. To support our global growth, in Q4, we launched our 18th Google cloud region and announced plans for a new region in Jakarta. So as you can see we are investing in the many incredible opportunities across our business. We would also investing in communities around the world and right here at home. I was recently in Europe opening up our new office in Berlin, which will help us more than doubled the number of Googlers who work there.
Across Europe, we've invested more than €4.3 billion in five data centers since 2007. And in Q4, we announced a new data center coming in Denmark. In all, it's estimated that these data centers have generated more than €5.4 billion in GDP over the last ticket. Of course the amount generated by our creator, publisher and app developer partners across the region is orders of magnitude larger.
We also continue our substantial investments throughout the U.S. Last year, we made significant investments in new and expanded office space. In Q4, we open the doors to our new office in Detroit and announced that we will be investing over $1 billion in capital improvements to establish a new campus in New York City, which will begin to open in 2020.
We are also continuing to invest in data center construction and expansion. There is an important long-term investment that lay the groundwork for our future computing needs primarily to x-rayed machine learning across our businesses. But also to support the opportunities we see in cloud, search, ads and YouTube. More than 20 years in there is still tremendous opportunity for Google to help people save time, learn new things, grow their businesses and build stronger communities. I want thank every Googler around the world for making 2018, a great year for users and our business.
With that I'll hand it back over to Ruth. Thank you, Sundar. And we will now take your questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open. Thank you so much for taking the question. Two, if I could. On YouTube, you never have a number of brands in the marketplace between YouTube Premium, TV, YouTube Music. How are you thinking about positioning those brands against a global opportunity, especially in mobile to consume media on a global scale and how you’re positioning those brands for the opportunity. And then, Ruth, I wanted to come back to comment on revenue versus extends with respect to YouTube. It sounds like called out YouTube as strong in the quarter on the revenue side, but is depressed on the expense side. Was that because of licensed content for things like Music and YouTube TV, or what is ad splits? How should we think about what the drivers were there and how they’re now permanent versus seasonal in Q4. Thank you so much. Thanks Eric. On the YouTube question, of course, our core effort is around the main YouTube product and that is what works at scale globally across the world and we are seeing continued engagement and it's doing very well. We are committed to making sure there's a premium experience on YouTube, delivering the content people would want and YouTube Music is an important part of that as well. So we're investing in both. As you know YouTube TV is U.S only and we are definitely -- it's an exciting product. It's differentiated and has long run value for us because it brings our advertising products together including being able to serve it across TV. So we are clearly investing in areas where we see opportunity. We are pretty thorough about making sure our investments deliver growth on the other side. And so we monitored with metrics and beat engagement and revenue growth and we see a lot of opportunity here. And then in terms of revenue it's an investment in YouTube, overall, as Sundar said, we are --YouTube is continuing to benefit from the secular change the way users are consuming content and that's reflected in strong revenue growth. Brand advertising does remain the largest part of the business. It's growing at a strong pace and as I said in opening comments, we're particularly excited about the significant growth in direct response both TrueView for action and app promo formats are delivering a great value for users and advertisers, and that's driving growth across regions and channels. In terms of the expenses, I think what you're referring to is within other cost revenues. The primary driver in the fourth quarter was the increase in content acquisition costs due to YouTube growth and that's both for ad supported content and what is typically a seasonally strong quarter. And also for our newer subscription businesses, which do have higher TAC as a percentage of revenue we're excited about the growth we're seeing here. Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Evercore. Your line is now open. Great. Thank you so much for taking my questions. One for Ruth and one for Sundar. Ruth, if I look at the segment operating losses for Other Bets, they were higher both in the fourth quarter and for the year '18 over '17. Is it safe to assume that investments at Waymo or can you just flush out a little bit more for us if possible, were there other Other Bets besides Waymo, which were worthy of call out in terms of greater or decreasing investment. That will be great? And then for, Sundar, I’m just wondering if you could provide us any commentary about how good the Cloud is going? Any milestones? You talked about the investment there. Ruth did, I think, in terms of headcount growth in technical and sales roles and for the new leadership that you mentioned what is the things that the new -- that Thomas Kurian can kind of do Cloud to accelerate the next phase of growth in that business. Thank you so much. So in terms of the investment levels in Other Bets, the major point is that we are investing across Other Bets commencement with what we think is required kind of looking out at the opportunity set for each one. And we go through a regular process with weekly business reviews and quarterly board reviews and try and calibrate the appropriate pace of investment. In terms of the increase this quarter, as I indicated in opening comments, we accrued some comp expenses for a number of bets and that was really to reflect increases in the valuation of equity in certain Other Bets. On Cloud, one of the things that was evident towards the end of last year is now our inability to win in a very large customers global 5,000 companies with multiyear contracts. And so that's definitely something we want to focus on. I think Dyne and Thomas have been working closely on a transition with a lot of continuity, and you'll continue to see us. It's very clear to us that our product offerings are ready and differentiated and so we want to invest and scale our go-to-market both in terms of direct sales and our channel partnerships. And maybe you will see us focus more on areas where we’re clearly seeing returns. Be the geographic regions we care about the six main verticals where most of the momentum is. And within product offerings, the five major areas where we’ve clearly defined product with differentiated features to. But I’m excited at the traction we are seeing, we are getting large wins and I look forward to executing here. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to ask to, first, can you think about the strong Google Sites growth 23%, that’s actually neutral. Can you just help us understand some of the mobile search innovations that you think are really driving things here beyond some of these underlying secular strength, with the particular focus perhaps on the retail channel, and just how you’re thinking about the opportunity there? And then, second, Ruth, just wanted to go back to your comment on OpEx. Just wanted to clarify, were you saying that headcount growth, specifically you think will moderate in '19 or are you talking about overall OpEx spending? Thank you. Doug, on the first one, obviously we have thousands of engineers working on continually launching search improvements. I think for me a lot of this has been the clear hard work that's gone into making sure search on mobile works really, really well removing friction where we can constantly working to get the answers, a bit quicker and faster and make -- making the more relevant. So to me it's more a set of a continual innovation mentality that we’ve had there for a long time. And that’s really working at scale. And then the specific comment I think you’re referencing is I was pointing to headcount growth. We are continuing to hire to support growth opportunities, particularly hiring engineers and product managers in Google and continuing to support growth in Cloud, and what I was just trying to draw out was we will continue to hire, but the year-on-year growth rate will moderate there. Okay. Thank you, both. Thank you. And then next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Great. Thank you. Yes, I had a follow-up on to Anthony's questions on cloud. It doesn’t seem like you want to share an update on the revenue run rate. But I was wondering if maybe you can share with us what you’re seeing in terms of year-over-year growth rate, and in particular are they growing faster than what the competitors disclosed in their public results? Because maybe they will help think about the pace of growth in your Cloud business. And then, secondarily I was just wondering if you can give us a sense of the types of workloads, if there's any commonality to the types of workloads, you might be running work frequently than not. Thank you. So, in terms of growth, Cloud does continue to deliver sizable revenue growth driven by GCP and GCP does remain one of the fastest-growing businesses across Alphabet. As Sundar said, we double the number of GCT contracts greater than a 1 million. We are also seeing a really nice uptick in the number of deals that are greater than $100 million and really pleased with the success and penetration there. At this point, not updating further. Heather, I think maybe specifically a couple of examples, there's definitely we see clear strength in data management and analytics, so we can take specs -- for example, in retail or if you take someone like the Telegraph, those very important factors. Application platforms, so our ability to help customers, deploy cloud native applications has been a differentiator for customers like Unity, Ubisoft, etcetera. And Multi Cloud, ability to run cloud services across Clouds on Prem. In terms out to be very important for global multinational companies like HSBC. So we do see a wide variety of stuff. We are clearly focused on infrastructure being an application platform, data management and smart analytics, and of course with G suite productivity and collaboration. So that's the core areas we are investing in from a product and a go-to-market standpoint. And we are seeing great traction there. Thank you. And the next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Thanks for taking mu questions. I have two. Just the first one to go back to YouTube in a very strong quarter. It sounds like on branded advertising and now some of these new direct response ads. I was curious, Sundar, as you think about with an innovation focus, what do you see as being one or two of the biggest opportunities to further improve the quality or the efficacy of the ad product, you provide for advertisers on YouTube from here. And then Waymo, got a couple of milestones. But the last 3 to 6 months, maybe talk us through how you see the next one or two big factors that you're really focused on ensuring that Waymo becomes what it could be? On YouTube, I still think we are in early days of making sure YouTube is better platform for direct response and TrueView for action is still early. We see great traction, but I think there's a lot more to do and I think we had a set of features which we launched last year to make sure it works better. But I think there's a lot more to do. In the long run, I think for me, YouTube is a place where we see users not only come for entertainment, they come to find information, they’re coming to learn about things. They’re coming to discover, to research and so being able to match that intent over time in a way that we can bring the right value for our users and advertisers. I think there's a long run opportunity. And we're taking all the right foundational steps to realize it. And in terms of Waymo, as you know well, we are intently focused on safety first and ensuring a great user experience, and that's why we're expanding methodically. We are pleased that we’ve continued to broaden out our service in the Phoenix area and we're focused on expanding both the number of riders in the geographic reach around Phoenix. In addition, we're having conversations with a number of other interested cities and we are continuing to explore applying our technology for logistics and deliveries and for personal use vehicles and for last mile solutions for cities, so continuing to execute as we’ve described previously. Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Thanks. Two questions. First, Ruth, could you just provide a little more color on the R&D expense build up. Anything unusual on there? Just comment on the cadence of that? Then, Sundar, on hardware that’s -- it's been a multiyear effort. It seems like it's accelerated. There's a series of these new products we try to do a report on to make sure we understood them. Could you talk about how the strategic and maybe the synergistic impacts that you're seeing of hardware on the rest of Google's business, on the rest of Alphabet's business, and do you think that it's still early days and maybe paint a picture of how significant those synergies could be? Thank you very much. So starting with R&D, the main driver is our ongoing investment in engineers, in particular, in Google and then as I said the sizable increase in accrued comp for Other Bets and just build that out a bit more, give you a bit more color, in certain Other Bets, employees are compensated through equity-based programs. And that's because we believe that this alignment of interest is valuable. We do assess valuation on an ongoing basis. And at a minimum, we do a formal valuation assessment once every 12 months or when there is a significant event. And what you're seeing in the fourth quarter is the impact of higher valuation in certain Other Bets. And as we've talked about previously, a goal with the Alphabet structure is to enable us to build new businesses that would make a positive impact and create long-term value. And it's still early days we're very excited about the opportunities we see. And so what you're seeing is the impact here of valuation. The way we approach it is very consistent with the way startups are typically valued, and that includes technical progress and a range of other items. And Mark, on hardware, obviously, we are working hard to offer the best Google experience we can bringing together AI software and hardware. And you are right that it does have a lot of synergistic value, but at the stage where we’re in. The main way we do that today for our core products is by using hardware to drive where the rest of the computing ecosystem is. And so we get a very leveraged effect there. But over time, as we scale up our hardware efforts and do it thoughtfully, so it definitely -- when I look at the kind of experience we can deliver. For example, if you look at something like the Google Home Hub and how it delivers a nice experience across Search, Assistant and YouTube and Photos when you wanted, you can definitely see the glimpse of the future. And so, we are investing to realize that. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. And the next question comes from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Okay. Sundar, just picking up on the AI for everyone theme, you’ve been highlighting at I/O as well as other venues. Are conversations with advertisers suggest that products like smart bidding are becoming a pretty -- increasingly popular tool to add to their bidding strategies. But how has the pickup been among the SMBs, especially among the local advertisers? Do you think you can target that market without a sales force? And secondarily, as we talk of two companies transitioning to a Cloud, there's increased talk of collecting data, dealing with data lakes as well as analyzing all that data to help their decision-making process. So from your standpoint running Google, do you feel like the current technology you have at your disposal is sophisticated enough to keep up with all of the needs for you to run the company as you collect all the data from across the internet? Thanks. I think two questions. On your first question around using machine learning to help serve advertisers better and be able to reach newer advertisers, SMBs and local advertisers. I definitely think you highlight an exciting opportunity. Whenever we’ve done work like be it last year or the last couple of years through universal app campaigns or smart shopping campaigns last year, responsive search ads, those are all great examples of where we brought ML. And with that, we made process much easier for advertisers of all sizes and we see an impact. So I think it's a natural extension for us to continue working in that direction, and that will help us reach SMBs and local advertisers better over time. So I do think that's a good opportunity. And on the second part of your question, I want to make sure I understand it. If you’re asking about how we invest in our security as a company, I think it's the foundation of how we do everything for the past 20 years. And we always -- we realize a deep responsibility that coming -- that comes with being stewards of users' data. So everything we design is designed with privacy and security in mind. It's where some of our core investments go, be it securing our data centers, literally the practices we have across the company, the quality and talent in our security teams and over time using AI itself to do all this well. So it's a core part of what we do and we take it very, very seriously. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Sundar, in your review of some of the shopping products during the fourth quarter, you didn't mention shopping actions. And there were reports there that Walmart decided to leave the program recently and I think there have been some public comments on social media from Googlers confirming that. So I would just love to hear a little bit more about that. But maybe more broadly the traction of shopping actions and, in particular, the price per sale metric that you rolled out with it during the holiday season. And then, Ruth, just a quick one for you, if we could return to your prepared remarks, there were a couple of sort of things to keep in mind that you’re highlighting. One was FX going from a tailwind to a headwind, but just before that you were talking about how new experiences can rollout over time to users. And I just wanted to clarify, were you referencing an experience that’s rolling out currently, or just generally that that is a best practice in general for Google? Thanks. On shopping, I think we launched shopping actions around, if I remember, March of last year. And we've definitely seen a strong traction there. I think we've seen roughly a sevenfold increase in merchants in the program since we launched it. And just in Q4, we announced new partnerships with Best Buy, Nike, Sephora as an example. And in terms of Walmart, we have -- Walmart is one of our deepest partners and they remain a strategy partner across multiple businesses for us, including Google Ads and we have efforts underway to work closer together with shopping. But they are definitely a large partner who continue experimenting and we will support them in many ways. But I think, overall, I’m excited about the efforts we are doing in shopping and you will see us focus more there on 2019. We see users come to Google a lot around key shopping moments and we want to make sure we invest in the experience to get closer to what they want. And then on the second question, we've talked about this on prior calls. We've often talked about the fact that we have been and remain committed to long-term revenue growth through innovation. And the point I was trying to underscore is the timing and scale of the impact. It's inherently difficult to predict. And so it can be inconsistent from quarter-to-quarter. The main point is we remain very excited about the opportunities for users and advertisers, in particular, building off of Sundar's comment as we apply machine learning to solutions. Great. Thank you, both. Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert Baird. Your line is now open. Great. Thank you. Two quick ones for me. First on Project Stream and YouTube TV. Just wondering how important it will be to invest in original content as well as how you might view the rollout of 5G as catalyzing consumer adoption of these services? And then on the Discover feed, I know that’s still pretty new, but curious if you have any color on usage and engagement to date? And if there's any way you expect to monetize that feed in the near future? Thank you. On Project Stream, being able to deliver gaming with the kind of real-time requirements, the low latency requirements, it's definitely for us -- it's an important computing advance. We think it will help us drive the newer computing platforms we're working on. And I do think, services like that will be a point of inflection as 5G rolls out as well. So I think it is a virtuous cycle. So we are excited. The early feedback our Project Stream experience has been super positive. And so we are looking to build up on that and you will see us do more there in 2019. On Discover, I think traction has been for us, we measure user engagement and satisfaction and happiness on these -- on anything new we do, and the metrics have been really strong. And we obviously -- we offer the best experience today on our products like Pixel, made by Google products. And we are looking to scale that up to reach more users. But we think we’ve a strong product there and I think it's very synergistic to search experience. And so we are looking to bring the best of both to our users, and you'll see us reach more users in 2019. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Great. Thank you. A couple of questions. First, it looks like Google core margins were down about 3 points and what was an easier comp. So just wondering if you can give us any thoughts on how the core advertising business is doing in there? We know there's a lot of investment in Cloud and hardware and YouTube TV, but just would like to get a update on the health of the advertising business margins. And any thoughts on if you ever do segment disclosure. And then the second question is just on the Cloud strategy. There's been a pretty big leadership change. Just wondering if there's any new strategies or new things you will be doing this year with the Cloud related to the management change? And look forward to the Cloud Conference in April. Thank you. Thanks. So, in terms of overall Google margins, I think that the main point you're seeing in the margins as we continue to see tremendous opportunity across Google, and so we're investing to support long-term revenue and earnings growth. We’ve talked a lot in this call already about the importance of machine learning and it is a key component of incremental investment, particularly, in CapEx for technical infrastructure to support the existing -- at the existing businesses, but also the newer ones, and that's kind of flowing through here. We've talked on prior calls that we're very mindful of the fact that CapEx turns into depreciation, which is why I single this out. We are continuing to see tremendous opportunity in the ads business, Search and Ads businesses and beyond machine learning we're further investing to continue to enhance the experience for users and advertisers, and that's across Mobile Desktop and YouTube. So, for example, a big priority in 2018 was expanding the availability of content for what we call the next billion user markets, which are for us a really important area. We are excited about the growth and the opportunity to deliver experiences across markets. We are also investing to enable more visual ways of finding information, such as photos and videos. And then, we are investing aggressively in our newer businesses within Google, particularly, Cloud and Hardware as Sunder has already said. So what you're seeing reflected through in the margins on the cost of revenue side is the impact of the product mix that we’ve talked about, a big part of that is the ongoing strength in YouTube and then on the OpEx side investing in engineers, in particular, for Google as well as on the sales and marketing side, the increased headcount to support not just Ads, but in particular Cloud. And on the second question on Cloud, I answered it around Anthony and Heather's question, but to add a little bit more color, while -- maybe it's the change in leadership, but it was a well planned transition. And so Diane and Thomas together planned 2019. And the big things you’re going to see are, a continued focus on global 5000 companies. We are definitely seeing traction with large multiyear contracts, multimillion dollar contracts there. So you'll see us focused there. We will continue to invest in and expand our sales and distribution channels to meet customer demand, so that's going to be an important area for 2019. But mostly being highly focused on the 15 countries, 6 industries and the 5 major solution areas that we think will have the most impact and directing most of our resources towards those efforts is probably something you will see continued emphasis in 2019. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Barclays. Your line is now open. Great. Two questions. First, there's a lot of discussion right now about alternatives to Google Play and Apple's App Store for distribution. And some of the large developers are starting to come up with these workarounds around the App Store fees. So, I guess, just philosophically, how do you think about the 30%? Do you think that’s the right long-term rate for Google Play? And then, Ruth, coming back to the headcount and CapEx growth moderating comments, so you have expenses growing well in excess of revenue for some time in the core Google segment, and 2018 was the lowest operating income growth since you started disclosing the segments. So are you just flagging this as a change of direction? Is this a material change or is this just a small amount of moderation in 2019? Thank you. On Google Play, obviously, we do this at scale, thousands of developers rely on it to safely and seamlessly distribute their game to billions of android users worldwide. And we invest a lot in our infrastructure to continuously make sure their overall experience is safe and results in high engagement and for the developer's back. So I think there's a value exchange there and it's been the industry standard. And so, I think we will continue down that path and -- but obviously always adapt to where the market is. And then in terms of the pace of investments, I’ve already laid out the focus areas and our commitment to continue to invest to support long-term revenue and earnings growth and just wanted to put a fine point on both CapEx and headcount. So on CapEx, as I indicated in opening remarks, we do expect the rate of year-on-year CapEx growth will slow meaningfully. So with the scale of our business and with our focus on user experience, it does require CapEx. We are committed to continue to invest in CapEx to deliver on that. In terms of the mix, we expect to see more of an uptick in 2019 in data center investments relative to servers. But the point which you asked in your question, the year-on-year growth rate will moderate meaningfully. And then, in terms of headcount, we are -- I was just trying to make clear that the growth in headcount will moderate somewhat here just so that there's no interpolation. Thank you. And our final question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Thanks. For Sundar, the cash position has doubled the last five years to $109 billion. Yet in the last four years M&A has been right around $3 billion, which is well below your peers. And I’m just curious that it seems like the core is very strong, but is there hesitation that you’re seeing in terms of valuation or other factors that are playing into that relative to what your peers are doing right now? I think, we’ve always approached M&A as I think really -- we are always evaluating opportunities. We’ve a very high bar, and so to me it's been more about us finding the right fit rather than being constrained by anything in particular. But I do think it's always an important part of our strategy and we've done great acquisitions in the past. Things like YouTube and android were big acquisitions for us. And so we continue to look for opportunities ahead. And real quick for Ruth, just the magnitude of spend, I think goes back to what probably investors were most surprised by. It sounds like from your perspective you don't really look at the margin structure as having any floor, you’re just looking at this as, as you said there's tremendous long-term opportunity that you need to make these investments now. I think many are just trying to search for a framework in how you think about this investment cycle we are in right now? So the reason I started by laying out, I think, in response to the question on margins where we're investing and how we look at is, we are very focused on investing to support long-term revenue and earnings growth. We are very mindful of the CapEx impacts on free cash flow and earnings growth. And so we're trying to get it right, over investing, under investing neither of those works for long-term value creation, but we are very mindful of the pace here and trying to lay out work with more specificity, how we are looking at the opportunity set where -- and making trade-offs where we can. Thank you. Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ellen West for closing comments. Thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter 2019 call. Thank you and have a good evening. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]
I'd now like to turn the conference over to Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Alphabet's second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai and Ruth Porat.
Now, I'll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, performance and operations, and our expected level of capital expenditures maybe considered forward-looking, and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC.
During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today’s earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor.
And now, I’ll turn the call over to Sundar. Thanks Ellen. Q2 was an exciting quarter at Google. We made several big announcements at I/O, YouTube's Brandcast, and Google Marketing Live. They're all part of our broader vision to build a more helpful Google for everyone. When we say everyone, we mean users, developers, creators, partners, advertisers, and all the customers of our growing cloud business, and the communities we call Home.
From the beginning, Google's mission has been to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. Over the years, we have evolved from a company that helps people find answers to a company that helps you get things done. Today, I'll share how we are approaching this work.
Building a more helpful Google starts with advancing our core information mission. In Q2, we have made a number of improvements to our founding product, Search. We redesigned our mobile search page and brought our popular full coverage feature to search to better organize news results.
We are also integrating augmented reality into Search. So, if say, you're searching for new shoes online, you can view the shoes in 3D or even superimpose them onto your wardrobe to see if they match.
Thanks to advancements in AI, we are making significant improvements to the Google Assistant. The next-generation Assistant, can process requests up to 10 times faster, making it easier to multi-task, compose e-mails, and even work offline. With features like Duplex on the web, that system will soon be able to help users book rental cars and buy movie tickets.
If you are searching for the fastest way home, Google Maps will now tell you when your bus is delayed or how packed your next train will be. We have rolled this out to people in 200 cities worldwide.
Google Maps can also help people stay safe in times of crisis. Last month, we added more visual information and a new navigation warning system to help you understand where the natural disaster is and better anticipate where it may be headed.
Building a more helpful Google for everyone means that everyone should be able to access and enjoy our products. That's why we are applying the latest advancements in AI to dramatically improve experiences for people with disabilities. One example of this is captions, which make content more accessible to the almost 500 million people in the world who are deaf or hard of hearing.
In Android Q, we can now add automatic live captions to any media playing on your phone such as videos, podcasts, and voicemails. We are also developing technology for the next billion users coming online in places like India, Brazil, and Indonesia. Yesterday, we introduced the gallery Go App. It's a way for people living in low connectivity areas to manage their photos and videos while offline.
Google Photos continues to be one of our most popular and beloved products, now with over one billion monthly users, and we are excited by the potential of Gallery Go to bring these benefits to the next billion users.
Building for everyone also means ensuring that privacy is equally available to everyone. In Q2, we announced privacy improvements to give users clear choices and more control around their data. We're making privacy controls more easily accessible, expanding our popular incognito mode to maps and adding new auto delete controls.
And we continue to challenge the notion that products need more data to be more helpful. For example, we invented a new technique called federated learning that allows us to train AI models and make products smarter without raw data leaving your device.
To make products work even harder for you, we have continued to invest in our hardware business, bringing together the best of Google's hardware, software, and AI. At I/O, we introduced some new additions to our hardware lineup including Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL. By taking advantage of our leading software capabilities, we can offer users a premium phone experience at a much lower price point.
With the launch of Pixel 3a in May, overall Pixel unit sales in Q2 grew more than 2x year-over-year. In addition to Verizon and the Google Store, we successfully expanded our distribution to T-Mobile, Sprint, U.S. Cellular, Spectrum Mobile, and additional partners which has greatly diversified our sales footprint in the U.S. Finally, we're also pleased that the Pixel 3a launch was met with their highest Net Promoter Score ratings to date.
We are also doubling down on creating a helpful Home, bringing all of our Home products together under the Nest brand. In Q2, we launched the Nest Hub in 12 additional countries. Demand across our helpful Home products continues to increase as we expand to new markets.
Our new Google Nest Hub Max, a voice activated smart display powered by the Google Assistant will be available later this summer. Stay tuned for even more on hardware this fall.
Beyond hardware, we continue to develop the open platforms and ecosystems that push computing forward such as Android, Google Play, and Chrome. At I/O, we showed some exciting improvements to Android Q. It's the first operating system to support 5G, includes support for foldable phones, and has nearly 50 updates focused on security and privacy, including more transparency and control over the location data you share with the apps.
And we continue to feel the excitement from users, developers, and publishers following the announcement of our new gaming platform Stadia. We recently announced pricing, availability and over 30 games coming to Stadia, in time for the consumer launch in November.
Another area that we are investing deeply is YouTube. Every day, users come to YouTube to learn new things. As a result, YouTube has become one of the world's most accessible educational platforms. We see strong growth in a number of areas. Creators continue to build engaged fan bases on YouTube. Channels with more than 1 million subscribers grew by 75% year-over-year.
Thousands of channels have doubled their total monthly revenue, by using new monetization products, like Super Chat, Channel Memberships and merch. And we are building momentum with our subscription services. YouTube Music and YouTube Premium now available in over 60 countries, up from five markets at the start of 2018.
At Brandcast, we introduced two important changes that help advertisers reach new audiences with premium content. First, new YouTube Original series, movies and live events will soon be made available for free, supported by ads. Second, YouTube TV with its 70-plus channels will be accessible as a standalone lineup in Google Preferred.
As we continue to invest in the platform, responsibility remains our top priority. One significant change we made in Q2 was to update our hate speech policy. And we continue to be vigilant about removing harmful content quickly and at scale. In the first quarter alone, we removed more than 8 million videos that violated our community guidelines.
The vast majority of those videos were flagged by machines and removed before getting a single view. We are also working to raise-up high-quality content and support our creators who are our next generation media businesses. These are a few of the many investments we have made to protect the community. The work is ongoing and we are committed to it.
Moving from YouTube to broader advertising platforms, at Google Marketing Live we introduced new ad formats such as Discovery ads, which offer a new visually rich mobile-first ad experience across Google properties. We also announced a unified shopping experience and universal shopping cart, all of which help to make Google more shoppable. We also announced Google Travel, a new centralized travel destination where people can plan and organize all aspects of their next trip all in one place, from booking flights and accommodations to planning activities.
Now on to our Cloud business, Q2 was another strong quarter for Google Cloud, which reached an annual revenue run rate of over $8 billion and continues to grow at a significant pace. Customers are choosing Google Cloud for a variety of reasons. Reliability and uptime are critical. Retailers like Lowe's are leveraging the Cloud as one of the important tools to transform their customer experience and supply chain.
Customers need flexibility to move to cloud in their own way. Anthos, announced earlier this year, provides advanced security and open architecture to support multi-and hybrid Cloud environments. That's important to many companies, including financial services customers like HSBC and new clients such as KeyBanc.
Scalable data management and analytics solutions are another strength of Google Cloud. Vodafone is using cloud to drive real-time customer and network analytics. And BrightInsight, a leading healthcare platform for connected devices and drugs, uses are solutions to improve security and compliance.
Finally Google Cloud's AI and ML solutions are also helping healthcare organizations, like Sanofi, accelerate drug discovery and as such, improve the healthcare experience and outcomes. We continue to build our world-class cloud team to help support our customers and expand the business and are looking to triple our salesforce over the next few years.
Finally, to support our rapidly growing cloud customer base and all of Google services globally, we broke ground on three data centers and launched our new Osaka Cloud region, the seventh in Asia Pacific. We also announced plans for a new Cloud region in Las Vegas, our seventh in the United States.
Lastly, beyond investments in products, we are investing significantly in the communities where we operate. In Europe, we recently announced €1 billion data center investment in the Netherlands, as well as the opening of our Google Safety Engineering Center in Munich Germany.
And right here at home, we announced a $1 billion investment in housing across the Bay Area to help address the chronic shortage of affordable housing. Earlier this week, we invested $50 million in Housing Trust Silicon Valley's TECH Fund, which furthers our goal to help communities succeed over the long-term and expands access to housing for those who need it most.
Finally, I'm excited that Google is an official supporter of the Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020. It's particularly special, since that's where we opened our first international office back in 2001. Ahead of the games, we are working with the City of Tokyo to ensure Japanese businesses can better serve new customers and help visitors make the most of their time there using products like Search, Maps and Translate.
At Google, we feel incredibly privileged to have the opportunity to help so many people everyday in moments big and small. There are many reasons to be optimistic about the direction technology is taking, from the applications of AI to address disease, to the potential of quantum computing, to deepen our understanding of the world. I want to thank Googlers around the world for another great quarter.
With that, I'll hand it over to Ruth. Thank you, Sundar. In the second quarter, total revenues of $38.9 billion were up 19% year-on-year and up 22% in constant currency. Once again, our results were driven by ongoing strength in mobile search, in particular, as well as YouTube and Cloud.
I will begin with a review of results for the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet focusing on year-over-year changes. I will then review results for Google, followed by Other Bets and we'll include with our outlook. We will then take your questions.
Let me start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Our total revenues of $38.9 billion reflect an acceleration in both reported and constant currency revenue growth across all regions compared with the first quarter. Details of our results by geographic region are available in our earnings press release.
Turning to profitability. On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I will discuss in the Google segment, was $17.3 billion, up 25% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $10.1 billion, up 35% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses.
The biggest contributor was costs associated with our data centres and other operations, including depreciation, followed by content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, and mostly for our advertising supported content, but also for our newer subscription businesses YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, which have higher CAC as a percentage of their revenues. This line was also impacted by growth in hardware costs, associated with the launch of our line of mid-tier Pixel 3a smartphones.
Operating expenses were $12.5 billion with headcount growth as the largest driver across each of R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A. The biggest increase, once again, was in R&D expenses reflecting our focus on product innovation. Growth in sales and marketing expenses also reflects an increase in advertising and promotional expense, primarily for the launch of our Pixel 3a lineup.
Stock-based compensation totalled $2.8 billion. Headcount was up 4,187 from last quarter. And consistent with prior quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were again in cloud for both technical and sales roles.
Operating income was $9.2 billion, up 13% year-over-year, excluding the impact of the EC fine in the second quarter of last year for an operating margin of 24%. Other income and expense was $3 billion, reflecting sizable gains, which are primarily unrealized from investments made by CapitalG, GV and more broadly at Alphabet. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Net income was $9.9 billion and earnings per diluted share were $14.21.
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $6.1 billion, which I will discuss in the Google segment results. Operating cash flow was $12.6 billion with free cash flow of $6.5 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $121 billion.
Let me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with the Google segment. Revenues were $38.8 billion, up 19% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenues were $27.3 billion in the quarter, up 18% year-over-year. In terms of dollar growth, results were led again by mobile search with a strong contribution from YouTube followed by desktop search.
Network revenues were $5.3 billion, up 9% year-on-year, continuing to reflect the performance of the primary drivers of growth within network, namely Google Ad Manager followed by AdMob. Other revenues for Google were $6.2 billion, up 40% year-over-year, fuelled by Cloud with an ongoing strong contribution from Play.
Within Cloud, growth in GCP was once again in the primary driver of performance, with strong customer demand for our compute and data analytics products. G Suite continues to be a valid set of productivity and work transformation apps with the results benefiting from both new pricing and seed growth.
Play's results were driven by strong growth in a number of active buyers. Hardware benefited from the successful launch of our Pixel 3a smartphones. We provide monetization metrics in our earnings press release to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses.
Total traffic acquisition costs were $7.2 billion or 22% of total advertising revenues, and up 13% year-over-year. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was down year-over-year reflecting primarily a favourable revenue mix shift from network to sites. The sites TAC rate increased year-over-year, primarily due to the impact of the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC, offset by the growth in TAC free sites revenues, primarily from YouTube. In Q2, the network TAC rate declined year-on-year, primarily due to a favourable product mix shift.
Operating income was $10.4 billion, up 16% versus last year and the operating margin was 26.8%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $6.9 billion, reflecting investments in office facilities and data centres followed by service.
Let me now turn to and talk about Other Bets. Revenues were $162 million, primarily generated by Fiber and Verily with an operating loss of $989 million. I'll note a couple of key recent accomplishments. Waymo now has over 1,000 active writers participating in Waymo One and has reached 10 billion miles driven in simulation. Waymo also announced that it has entered into an exclusive partnership with Renault and Nissan to explore driverless mobility services for passengers and deliveries in France and Japan.
Loon was once again able to step in and provide connectivity in the aftermath of a natural disaster after the recent earthquake in Peru. This follows previous deployments of Loon after hurricanes in Puerto Rico and floods in Peru.
Let me now conclude with some comments about our longer-term outlook. Based on the strength of the U.S. dollar to-date relative to the third quarter of last year, we expect continued FX headwinds again in the third quarter. As a reminder, FX headwinds affect both revenues and operating income given the majority of our expenses are in the U.S.
Turning to revenues. We are pleased with the ongoing momentum in our revenue growth, especially on a base of nearly $150 billion in revenues over the last 12 months.
With respect to Sites revenues, the strength in the second quarter again reflects our ongoing innovation in part from the benefits of applying machine learning. We remain confident about the ongoing opportunity set. And within other revenues, once again Cloud was the largest driver within other revenues and the third largest driver of revenue growth for Alphabet overall.
In fact, in the second quarter of 2019, as Sundar mentioned, the annual run rate for Cloud revenues was over $8 billion and Cloud continues to deliver significant growth. In terms of our hardware business, we were pleased with the reception of the Pixel 3a line-up of mid-tier smartphones in the second quarter and look forward to the fourth quarter launch of our newest devices, some of which we showcased at I/O.
Turning to profitability. With regard to Google operating expenses, the second quarter results once again reflect our ongoing commitment to investing for the long-term. At this point, we expect that our 2019 headcount growth rate will be closer to the 2018 rate, in other words slightly higher than we originally forecast for a couple of reasons. Strategically, we are increasing our hiring in Cloud and are incorporating the impact of the Looker acquisition, which we expect to close before the end of this year.
And operationally, we're taking steps to optimize workforce deployment by moving certain customer support functions in-house, which is both OpEx neutral and enhances operational effectiveness. As a reminder, headcount additions tend to be seasonally higher in Q3, because that is when we bring on new graduates.
In terms of sales and marketing, consistent with prior years, we expect sales and marketing to be more heavily weighted to the back half of the year to support the holiday season. In Other Bets, we continue to invest meaningfully for the long-term opportunity we see.
Turning to CapEx and capital allocation. To give you more insight into our investment and capital expenditures, I will discuss the two major components of Google CapEx separately. First, the majority of our Google CapEx is what we refer to as technical infrastructure, which consists of our investments for compute, storage and networking requirements and includes data center land and construction, servers and network equipment.
The second category of CapEx is for our office facilities, including acquisitions, ground-up development projects and related building improvements. In the last couple of years, within Google CapEx, on average approximately 70% was for technical infrastructure and 30% was for office facilities.
Both, the split between the two components and year-on-year growth rates, can vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter, due primarily to the timing of sizable purchases of office facilities. For example, in Q1, technical infrastructure was about 80% of Google CapEx; whereas in Q2, it accounts for about 60% due to the purchases of office facilities we made in the quarter.
As we discussed on the fourth quarter call, we believe there are two important factors when considering our pace of CapEx investing. First, we expect the overall growth rate will moderate quite significantly for the full year 2019 versus 2018. Second, in terms of the mix within technical infrastructure, we expect to see more of an uptick in 2019 in data center investments relative to servers in contrast to the ranking in 2018. Growth in technical infrastructure is designed to support, in particular, our efforts in machine learning across our businesses as well as to support growth in Cloud, Search and YouTube.
With respect to capital allocation. Our primary use of capital continues to be to support organic growth in our businesses, followed by retaining flexibility for acquisitions and investments. We complement these growth drivers with a return of capital. As we indicated in our press release today, our Board has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $25 billion of our Class C Capital Stock. In conclusion, we are confident about the opportunities ahead and continue to invest thoughtfully for the long term.
We will now take your questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your line is now open. Thanks for taking the question. And really appreciate all the additional commentary and disclosure in the remarks. I think investors will find that really helpful. Sundar maybe could you, one bigger picture question. A lot of innovation on the product side in the early part of this year. Now those products are going to start getting rolled out in the back part of this year and into 2020. Can you give us a little bit of additional color on what some of the key investments you're making, some of the key themes you're trying to drive after in terms of pushing the organization to collaborate on product launches and leveraging the strength within Google?
And then the second part of the question would be, as you lower friction for consumers on the product side, what are you hearing from advertisers on the monetization site about how those product might resonate on the monetization piece? Thank you so much. Thanks Eric. On -- in terms of the key investments, we still continue. We have been focused on our investments in AI. So that continues to be kind of a foundational investment we are making across the board, including getting a lot of our engineers trained on AI techniques et cetera across the board. So it's an important area we are focused on. And making sure, digging deeper to push our products to be more helpful is the main theme, by which we are evaluating everything we do.
Beyond that be it, the focus on cloud has been a big part of it, continuing to scale up YouTube including being focused on content responsibility. These are all some of the key things we are doing. And of course deep focus on Search and Assistant being a core part of everything we do.
In terms of the work we are doing on consumers and the impact it has on monetization. And I do think they go hand-in-hand as we are making the experience better for customers, including on products like Discover. So just getting information to them more seamlessly when they need it, I think they all tend to have a commercial aspect at the right intent when users are interested in it. And so we always see them go hand-to-hand. And so taking a long-term view, I think it will resonate on the monetization side as well. And just building a bit of that question and the impact from some of the announcements that you've seen from us. To just comment a bit on the impact from Google Marketing Live that Sundar referenced at the outset. I think what's notable here is that every year at GML, we announced new changes to products and features and most ads product launches are introduced in phases as advertisers initially experiment with new formats. And so as a result the new products that were announced at GML typically are adopted over time.
And so I just wanted to add in here because while we're excited about the new ads products we announced to GML last quarter, given they offer great new user experiences across new services, we don't view this year's slate of launches differently from introductions made in previous years. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks for taking the question. I was just hoping Ruth, you could just talk a bit more about the accelerating growth that you saw in 2Q relative to the slowdown that we saw in 1Q. It seems certainly in the previous quarter to skew more to the Google Search site than YouTube. I was just hoping you could provide little more clarity on maybe how the product changes that you've talked about in the past played out across 1Q and 2Q. And then just Sundar on user privacy and control over data, that was certainly a key theme across the multiple events in 2Q. Can you just talk about how you balance those initiatives as you're rolling out products going forward? Thanks. So, starting first with the strength in sites revenue. The strength we talked about here this quarter reflects the same underlying trends that we discussed previously. And I tried to really call that out in opening comments. And part is the benefit from applying machine learning to both the user and advertiser experience. And it really just -- I'm echoing a lot of what we said in prior quarters the last quarters where we remain very positive about the opportunity set.
We introduced product changes only after extensive testing, which means there can be some variability in quarterly growth rates as you've seen, but are very positive about the opportunity set. And overall as it relates to both Search and YouTube strength, I would just to add on YouTube revenue growth for YouTube was strong in the first quarter. In fact, we called it out as the second largest driver of revenue growth across Alphabet. And in the second quarter, YouTube was again the second largest contributor of revenue growth. And really pleased with the ongoing momentum that we're seeing here. On user privacy and control, it's always been a big focus for us in some of the things we recently announced. Initiative is underway for example like federated learning for almost three years. So, going forward, I think you'll continue to see us focus on. I think it's one of the most important areas we are working on. But I think with AI, we are excited that we can give better experiences for users with less data over time. And those are the kind of directions we are pushing. We are also -- you'll see us continue to work hard to simplify user understanding of how their data is used and giving them better controls and making it more easy for them to manage and making sure more users actually exercise those controls. So, those are all our goals and we'll continue focusing on that as we move forward. Thank you both. Thank you. And our next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Okay. Thank you. So, Ruth in regards to the Cloud $8 billion annual run rate commentary, just wondering if we can get some clarifications there. Does this include GCP as well as G Suite?
And further is this apples-to-apples to I guess the $1 billion that you -- I think Sundar talked about, I think that was during the fourth quarter of 2017. And any other comments you can add there in terms of the mix between I guess the more GCP versus the more traditional G Suite? Thank you. Yes. So, it does include the entire business that Thomas Kurian is leading. Our Cloud business that includes both GCP and G Suite. And it is on an apples-to-apples basis. It continues to be the business the cloud business.
We're not breaking out the components of cloud as I tried to indicate in opening comments, pleased with the performance of both GCP and G Suite. Growth in GCP was led by strong customer demand for our compute and data analytics products and G Suite continues to deliver strong growth, as I noted in the opening comments, with the results benefiting from both new pricing and [C] [ph] growth.
And overall, GCP remains one of the fastest growing businesses in Alphabet and we're really pleased with how the team is executing on both. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Great. Thank you very much. And I'll just echo people's comments about the new disclosure. That's much appreciated. So thank you so much for sharing. I wanted to ask, Sundar, how you've seen your go-to-market and partnership strategies change under Thomas?
It does seem that Google has become the more friendly cloud company, if you will, from a -- when you think about partnering with other software companies. And I'm wondering if there's any tangible benefits you can point to because of this, whether it's in win rates or partner momentum or anything else that you can call out.
And then, I also wanted to ask, you obviously made the acquisition of Looker recently. How are you thinking about organic versus inorganic product development? And I'm just wondering, has the thought process there changed with Thomas running the business now? Thank you. Thanks, Heather. I appreciate it. Definitely go-to-market, Thomas has been heavily focused on it. Mainly with the realization that we are very competitive when we are there in the banks. And so, focusing on how we can scale up and really build a customer-facing organization.
So, we are investing heavily, be it in sales, service, partner and operational teams. And as I mentioned in my opening comments, we are looking to triple the size of our sales force over the next few years. And we are doing it aggressively in major markets around the world.
Some specifics, we did launch our new partner program Partner Advantage. The ASAP relationship has been super important to us. And so, we have really focused on that, helping many customers make us care for. Home Depot, Cardinal Health, are some examples of that. And a big part of it has been really expanding our customer-facing bench.
Several new senior executive hires in addition to our new Global Head of Sales. We recently added a 25-year customer experience veteran to build out our customer support. So I think, you're good to see that focus of being -- serving customers. We have done it in our other areas. We are used to building ecosystems. If you look at an ecosystem like Android, this is what we do. And so, that's going to be a focus for us.
In terms of the second question about organic and -- versus inorganic. I think we are clearly focused on the areas where we are differentiated. Data and business analytics was a key, data management and analytics is a key area for us. And as part of that, we looked at gaps we have, which would help us complete the solution offering we have there for customers.
And that's what drove the Looker acquisition. So we'll be customer focused. And to the extent we see gaps there -- gaps anywhere, we'll obviously look at doing it in-house, versus whether there's an attractive opportunity outside and take it on a case-by-case basis. But that's where it will come from. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC. Your line is now open. Can I try two questions, please. Ruth - first, Ruth, just any color on that 25 billion share repurchase authorization, why 25, not 20, not 30, any color there. And then, when you think about ad business. We've seen this nice acceleration in Q2, but that's kind of back to norm. There's still this question about what happened in Q1. Was there something that happened in Q1 that you needed to correct in Q2? Is it just the normal rhythms of the search in YouTube and advertising businesses? So I find Q1 still a little bit of a question mark. Q2 seems like very much the norm with the last several years. So any color on what could have transpired in Q1 then that required a fix in Q2? Thanks a lot. I'll answer them in reverse order. I tried to comment on that last quarter and reiterated again this quarter. We are pleased with the ongoing momentum in the business. And the key point that I'll just reiterate is that as much as there is a lot of innovation going on in the business and we've talked about that, we introduced product changes only after extensive testing and that means there can be variability in quarterly growth rates as you've seen.
And so we're pleased with the strength of the business. The team is extremely focused on ensuring we're delivering for users and advertisers. And as we're looking out, we talked in the past we have introduced over 100 enhancements to the user set every quarter and no unchanged drives results.
And as we discussed last quarter, there can be timing variability and our view is let's ensure that we stay focused on the right things for the long-term and the quality that we can deliver. So there's really not much more to add there.
And then on the capital return. I guess, the main point is we went back to this year, we're staying with the same capital allocation framework we've talked with you about before. The primary thing is we remain focused on investing for long-term growth and the primary use of capital really is to support that growth.
And then the second use is really to support acquisitions and investments as we've already been talking about. And given the -- our outlook on cash, our view was that it was appropriate to step in here again. We've increased our program four times since we began the program in 2015, and pleased to have the opportunity to announce another increase here today. The $25 billion and I think the main point is we view the repurchase program as an effective use of capital. Okay. Thanks, Ruth. Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Thanks for taking the questions. I have two. The first one, Ruth your color on YouTube was really helpful on being the second largest driver this quarter and last quarter. I guess with that as a backdrop with the overall acceleration, can you just give us a couple examples, what types of products or advertisers segments or regions resonate particularly well on YouTube this quarter versus last quarter?
And then a question for Sundar or Ruth. This has been recent announcement in press about children safety on YouTube. And so I guess I'm just curious to hear for advertisers and parents on the call, what steps have you taken to really make sure that YouTube is safe for kids. And what are the biggest areas you're focused on to make sure it stays that way? Thanks. So in terms of YouTube growth, just maybe to add a bit more there given your question. I already noted that YouTube revenue growth was strong in the first quarter and again strong here in the second quarter.
To clarify, the changes in early 2018 that I referenced on the call last quarter, regarding sites click and CPC growth were not related to policy enforcement actions at YouTube. They had a negligible impact on YouTube revenues. Just to be a really clear. The revenue growth was strong last quarter. And so the click and CPC growth are unrelated to actions on policy enforcement in terms of our ongoing efforts to protect the YouTube ecosystem, we do remain focus and taking the right steps in line with our goals, regardless of impact on the revenues. But an important point is to the removal of content that violates our policies have virtually no impact on YouTube revenues. I just wanted to make sure that was clear. So, consistent growth here.
Going into your -- the first part of your question. Where is that growth? Again, I'm going to reiterate what we've talked about on prior calls that we continue to see substantial growth in direct response. So, brand advertising is still the largest part of the business. It's growing at a strong pace. But really I would reiterate what we said previously that we continue to see substantial growth in direct response. And on your important question about kids' safety, as part of our content responsibility work it's one of the most important areas we focus on. You will see us -- this is why we have put a lot of effort into developing YouTube Kids and it's a product you're going to see us focus more and continue to evolve, add more curated content there, and make sure it's safe for kids and give parents peace of mind.
Also ensuring that the content responsibility work applies to family-oriented content on the main YouTube app as well. So, all the work we are doing be it the work we are doing to just remove that content raise up authoritative content higher quality content and reducing the step of harming content all applies everywhere and we're really focused on it. Rewarding trusted creators is a big way we can help -- ensuring greater to produce content which is great for children rewinding them. It's also an important goal for us. Great. Thanks. Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. All right. Good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe that's for Ruth, but Sundar feel free to jump in. The first one here is based on a couple of comments you reminded us in your prepared remarks about YouTube which was the inclusion of Originals and YouTube TV in the Google Preferred inventory.
You've given us a little bit of color on direct response growth at YouTube over the last little while. Can we assume that those two additions were a bit of a boost to the brand advertising side of the business as that's more inventory available for that for that sort of high-quality type of brand orientation that TV advertisers are looking for?
And then just second coming back to Google Marketing Live notwithstanding your comments Ruth that it take some time for products to be adopted. There are maybe one or two out of those announcements there that you would highlight as being potentially particularly material over the longer term? Thank you. On the first in terms of YouTube for brand, I would say it's more secular across the platform promoting higher-quality content, our work on brand safety, content, responsibility adds up to it. Also creators just generating better content. I think all have played a part and I would say it's more crosscutting.
On the second thing on Gmail in terms of things we were excited about. To me be discovery ads and gallery ads, I mean they're both pushing us towards mobile first visually-rich immersive ad formats, which also offers a really great user experience. So I think I'm excited about changes like that and I think they have the potential. There is advertiser excitement. But as Ruth mentioned it's early days and I think we rollout now, it takes time to play out. But we definitely see excitement there. Great. Thanks, Sundar. Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark May from Citi. Your line is now open. Thank you. Well, first is for Sundar. I think earlier Ruth had mentioned the importance of machine learning for driving growth in the quarter, and I'm sure in many recent quarters. I believe many have a hard time understanding exactly what that means. And I was hoping you might provide a couple of specific examples of how the company is leveraging machine learning recently to help drive growth and improvements for both users and advertisers?
And then secondly for Ruth in terms of the sites TAC, I know there are a lot of variables that go in the changes in sites TAC. But when you look at the puts and takes, how do you see that trending over the next year or two? Thanks. For us, machine learning plays a critical role across both the consumer user experience and part of ads too. Generally using machine learning to simplify things for advertisers and make campaigns easier and give them better insights is where we see a lot of benefit on the ad sites. So, for example, processing complex datasets and giving back sophisticated real-time insights really helps make a difference. And also on the front end for marketers, helping them find the right creator for every moment, helping them manage bidding in real-time. And so every step in the consumer journey, I think machine learning is just making things more efficient, more easier to use and driving productivity for them. So that's what plays out through our systems. And in terms of the TAC rate. As we've talked about previously, the growth in mobile does put upward pressure in the sites TAC rate and that was the primary driver of the year-on-year increase in the second quarter. And we do expect the underlying trend to continue given the ongoing growth in mobile. Thanks Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian from Baird. Your line is now open. Thanks. A couple for me as well. First off, as you embrace more commerce and payments on the platform broadly speaking along with the new ad formats you've talked about, can you also talk about what role take rates might play in terms of future initiatives and revenue growth?
And then secondly on Assistant and Duplex, in terms of near-term Search innovation, I wonder if you could characterize how important that is in terms of the momentum you're seeing and longer term, how this might impact platform monetization? Thank you. On the first question, I think it's a good question. There's a lot of discovery that happens across Google's properties and including Search and YouTube. And so anything we can do to make sure users have a better experience when they are interested in transacting will have a big role.
So there's a lot more work underway to make sure payments work better. Sign in works better. Payments works better. All of that I think will be -- over the long-term will be drivers, because it improves overall user expense especially for commercial clicks.
In terms of Assistant and Duplex, I mean, for us Assistant is where we can clearly see we can really push our goal of being more helpful to users, helping them get things done, including things that matter in the real word. And so, that's what we are focused on. And if we get that right, just like with the Search, there are many things which users want to get done, which do have commercial intent to them. And I think that's the value-creation opportunity as well. But we are focused on making sure the user experience constantly gets better and we are investing to get there. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Great. Thank you. Sundar, there's been a lot of regulatory news lately, especially from the DOJ. Just wondering how you think about a more intense regulatory environment. Getting a lot of questions and wondering, if you think about that, really affecting Google operations. And then, Ruth, definitely nice acceleration across the board. Of course, Europe accelerated as well. When you think about GDPR implementation last year and you're lapping that, is that helping Europe at all? Or was there really no impact from GDPR? Thank you. On the regulatory question, we understand that there will be scrutiny. We are - we will engage constructively. It's not new to us. We have participated in these processes before. Today we do operate under a lot of regulation, be it on privacy, be it on competition, be it on copyright, intellectual property, et cetera.
And even in the U.S., we have engaged in the process before to the extent we have to answer questions, we will do so constructively. And to the extent there are concerns, we'll address them as well. But I think, for me, it's important that we stay focused on building helpful products to users and that's the value we ultimately provide our users. And I think that's what we'll stay focused on as a company. And in terms of GDPR, we did implement late in the second quarter of 2018. We think it's, obviously, a critical area, making sure we get it right. That's at the overall impact of regulation on consumers and businesses, is it still playing out. And we're very focused on making sure we're doing what's best for users and ensuring we're compliant with the law, not based on any potential revenue impact. Thank you. Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Ross Sandler from Barclays. Your line is now open. Hey guys. If I can squeeze two in real quick. Ruth, the Google segment operating profit was up 16%. That's the highest growth rate in about two years. So, I guess, how should we think about the cadence of that relative to your comments about the headcount growth in the Looker acquisition looking forward?
And then Sundar, at I/O you mentioned that active Android installed base is now over 2.5 billion. That's up about 10% year-on-year and a lot of that’s coming from emerging markets. So, I guess, just big picture, how do we think about the growth rates that you can sustain in mobile search revenue relative to that 10% active Android growth rate? Thank you. Yeah. Thanks for that. I tried to enumerate the things as we're looking forward very much to your question. Our overall long-term investment thesis is unchanged. We are very focused on investing to support the ongoing growth we see across Google in particular as we're talking about in Search while we're also investing to build new businesses most notably in Cloud as we've talked a lot about here today.
And across all of Alphabet, we do continue to benefit from machine learning that's both OpEx and CapEx. And as we both commented given the opportunities we see with the application of machine learning across the business, we are continuing to invest.
Our lens on the pace of investing does have three facets in it. First is investing at the appropriate pace to support long-term earnings growth. And then we were very focused second on optimizing investments within each product area. And finally, as we've talked about investing to support operational excellence.
But the mega point is that we are excited about the long-term opportunity and we're continuing to invest which is why in opening comments, I wanted to make sure to call out what we're seeing with respect to ongoing investments and across the business the increases in headcount and the reasons for them at the benefits of those investments as well as sales and marketing and the fact that that is back half loaded and -- back half weighted I should say. And so try to lay out the relevant points for you to ensure that we make it very clear. We are committed to continue to invest for what we see as a long-term opportunities. And on the mobile question, we are definitely investing in Android with a focus on the next billion users as well as making sure the mobile experience continues to evolve. In terms of the mobile experience, I still think from a user standpoint, there's a lot of information overload. So, being helpful to users and helping them navigate it be it Search, Assistant, Maps, and YouTube I think we are focused on the opportunities there.
And in terms of the next billion users there's a lot of headroom there over time and we are focused on. That's why we take efforts like Android Go seriously. We are constantly working hard to lower the barrier so that more people can benefit from being online and participating in the digital economy and so it will continue to be a focus for us. Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ellen West for closing remarks. Thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter call. Thank you and have a good afternoon. Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today's conference.

During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor.
And now, I'll turn the call over to Sundar. Thank you, Ellen, and good afternoon everyone. It’s a privilege to join the call as the CEO of both Alphabet and Google after four years as CEO of Google. I’d like to start by thanking Larry and Sergey for giving all of us at Google a timeless machine, enduring values and an opportunity to have an impact on the world. There’s a lot I want to cover today, and I also want to leave plenty of time for any questions you may have for me and Ruth.
As you have seen in our press release, we’ve added new revenue disclosures to give greater insight into our business. Search and other Google properties continue to drive great results with total revenues in 2019 of $98 billion and strong growth. I’m also really pleased with two of our newer growth areas. YouTube reached $15 billion in ads revenues in 2019 growing at 36%, compared with 2018, and it now has over 20 million music and premium paid subscribers and over 2 million YouTube TV paid subscribers, ending 2019 at a $3 billion annual run rate in YouTube subscriptions and other non-advertising revenues.
Google Cloud ended 2019 at a more than $10 billion run rate, up 53% year-on-year, driven by significant growth in GCP. The growth rate of GCP was meaningful higher than that of Cloud overall and GCP’s growth rate accelerated from 2018 to 2019. Before I talk about the highlights of the quarter, I want to take a step back and give some early thoughts about my approach to managing Alphabet and Other Bets.
We’ve always taken a long-term view investing in deep computer science and technology. Important trends like the wider adoption and application of artificial intelligence, ambient computing, and the move to the Cloud underline our investments across Google and our other Alphabet companies. Our work in healthcare is a great example of how our investments in these areas allows us to deliver solutions across an entire sector.
Google Cloud works with hospitals and healthcare providers to securely manage their patients’ data. Data that is much more secure than the Cloud than in paper records or on premises. Our AI teams at Google also work with partners to apply AI to help them and their patients whether it s developing better health systems or helping with the diagnosis and deduction of disease.
Among their broader efforts are Other Bets, Verily and Calico, are also partnering with industry leaders to use AI and cloud technologies to improve clinical trials, research, and drug development. Our thesis has always been to apply these deep computer science capabilities across Google and our Other Bets to grow and develop into new areas. The Alphabet structure allows us to have a portfolio of different businesses with different time horizons without trying to stretch a single management team across different areas.
We’ll continue to take a long-term view managing the portfolio with a discipline and rigor needed to deliver long-term returns. Many of our Other Bets are getting to the stage where it now makes sense for them to partner closely with other players and investors in the industry. Waymo’s technological leadership is widely reported. Its cars have driven 20 million miles across more than 25 U.S. cities. Waymo is now serving over 1,500 monthly active riders in Metro Phoenix and continuous scaling fully driver less by matching early riders with driver less vehicles and charging for these rides.
As Waymo looks to its evolution as a business, it’s focusing on strategic partnerships. For example, it’s working closely with OEMs and other businesses to build out ride-hailing and delivery business lines. And Verily is an example of a company in the portfolio that has outside investors, Silver Lake and Temasek, as well as its own board will consider opportunities for some of our Other Bets to take similar steps over time.
Now, onto highlights from the quarter. First, Search and related Google properties. As I mentioned on our last call, our neural network-based technique for natural language processing called BERT, is the biggest advancement in search in the last five years. It now impacts 10% of searches and in Q4; we roll it out in over 70 languages. In Maps, we are celebrating our fifteenth anniversary very soon and in the past year we brought reliable directions to 630 million additional people in locations that previously weren’t well-mapped.
We added as many buildings to Maps using ML in 2019 as we have added using all techniques in the previous decade. With all these improvements user growth is strong and the range of things people are doing with Google Maps continues to expand as well. The Google Assistant now helps more than 500 million monthly users across 90 counties to get things done, across smart speakers and smart displays, phones, TVs, cars and more.
Shopping and commerce is another exciting area. We are making strong leadership hires in this area to help build a thriving business for partners of all sizes. Over the Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday weekend, we had the largest number of daily shoppers on Google.com ever in our history. Throughout the entire holiday shopping season, we also expanded the selection of products on Google due to a 4X uptick in the number of U.S. merchants participating in our shopping actions program.
Second, YouTube. Speaking of shopping, people can now easily buy products in YouTube's home feed and search results making it possible for advertisers to reach even more audiences. Try searching for Puma shoes review on YouTube to see an example. With all the related content on YouTube like unboxing and beauty videos, this is the format people love and it delivers a simple in-video buying experience.
A huge focus is continuing our work to keep YouTube safe for users, creators, and advertisers. You may have seen a blog post today about our work to promote authoritative content and remove misleading information about the upcoming 2020 elections. For example, we are applying our deceptive content policies to reduce misleading information about voting locations or the census process.
As I mentioned earlier, we are pleased with YouTube's growth in advertising and subscriptions and we are also pleased with the early results from other revenue options we offer creators, including memberships, brand integrations, merchandise, and ticket sales. Continuing on now to cloud. We are really pleased with the momentum we are seeing in cloud. Year-on-year, the number of deals over $50 million more than doubled.
The investments in Cloud’s go-to-market expansion are resulting in customer momentum. Wayfair is one of the many retailers who successfully ran holiday operations on Google Cloud. In addition, Lowe's which began transitioning of its legacy e-commerce system in late 2018 to Google Cloud worked with us during this year's peak holiday buying season to improve the stability of their e-commerce site.
Worth noting, at the peak time, customers in our Black Friday/Cyber Monday program used for 4x to computer resources, compared to previous year and our platform experienced 100% uptime. Lufthansa Group is using our AI Solutions to develop new tools that will improve air travel operations. The U.S. Postal Service also chose Google Cloud AI to improve business processes and customer experience. We have recently signed a 10-year agreement with Sabre to help them improve operations and develop new air line and hospitality services.
Finally, Google other revenue. Android continues to thrive. I’m proud to announce that over $80 billion has been earned by developers around the world from Google Play showing the popularity of our platform. There are now over 2 billion active monthly users of Google Play. Hardware is still in the early stages of delivering on our vision for ambient computing.
Our home devices demonstrate how this vision can come to life in creating the home of the future with our new Nest Mini and Nest Hub Max selling well over the holidays, following on from the Pixel 3a, which sold well last year. With Pixel 4, we continue to build out our capabilities and are keenly focused on execution delivering great user experiences and broadening our distribution, and our pending acquisition of Fitbit will give us a foundation in variables. I'm excited about our roadmap ahead across our products.
Overall, in 2020, our teams at Google are focusing on four key things. First, creating the most helpful products for everyone. We are really focused on ensuring that our products like Search, Maps and Assistant are helping people in their daily lives. Second, providing the most trusted experiences for our users. We are doing lots of work to keep improving user’s privacy and security, while also keeping harmful content of our systems.
Third, executing at scale. This will show up as more seamless products across various surfaces and platforms like the Google Assistant, deeper partnerships and better use of our shared infrastructure. For example, Activision Blizzard recently chose Google as a strategic partner using Google Cloud's computing infrastructure, YouTube for live streaming, and our AI tools. Putting together these multi-product partnerships helps us unlock great opportunities for our partners.
And fourth, creating sustainable value. This means optimizing our usage of computing resources and also growing business opportunities in areas like YouTube, Cloud, Play, hardware and beyond. So, as you can see there’s a lot happening at the company and a real sense of excitement and focus. I want to thank our employees for all the great work in 2019.
With that, I’ll turn it over to Ruth and I look forward to your questions. Thanks, Sundar. We’re very pleased with our strong 2019 results with total alphabet revenues of $162 billion, up 18% year-on-year or 20% in constant currency. In dollar terms, this represents an increase of $25 billion in revenues relative to 2018. I will review our quarterly and annual results, including our new revenue disclosures and conclude with our outlook. Sundar and I will then take your questions.
Starting with consolidated Alphabet results, in the fourth quarter, our total revenues were $46.1 billion, up 17% year-on-year and up 19% in constant currency. Our results were driven by ongoing strength in Search, YouTube, and Google Cloud offset by a decline in hardware revenues. Details of Alphabet's consolidated revenues by geographic region are available in our earnings press release.
Regarding our key expense lines, on a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, was 21 billion, up 17% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was 12.5 billion, up 19% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses. The biggest factors here again this quarter were costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation, and then content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube and mostly for our advertising supported content in what has been a seasonally strong quarter for YouTube, but also for our newer paid YouTube music and premium subscription services, as well as YouTube TV, which have higher content acquisition costs as a percentage of their revenues. These were partially offset by a decline in cost associated with lower hardware sales.
Operating expenses were 15.8 billion with headcount growth being the largest driver of year-on-year growth for R&D and sales and marketing expenses. Headcount drives both compensation and related facilities expenses. After headcount growth, the biggest driver in R&D expenses was an increase in valuation-based compensation charges in certain Other Bets. Stock-based compensation totaled 2.6 billion; headcount was up 4,803 from the third quarter, and up 20% over 2018.
Again, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were again in Google Cloud for both technical and sales roles, including the impact of the Looker acquisition, which closed in December. Operating income was 9.3 billion, up 13% year-over-year for an operating margin of 20%.
Other income and expense was 1.4 billion, which primarily reflects an increase in the market value of certain publicly traded equities, as well as a non-cash gain from a Verily transaction. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Our effective tax rate was 0.3% for the fourth quarter and was 13% for the full-year.
The fourth quarter ETR reflects the impact of discrete items, including the resolution of multi-year audits. As you have seen in prior years, ETR can vary on a quarterly basis. Net income was 10.7 billion and earnings per diluted share were $15.35.
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was 6 billion, which I will discuss in the Google segment results. Operating cash flow was 14.4 billion with free cash flow of 8.4 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately 120 billion.
Let me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with the Google segment. Revenues were 45.8 billion, up 17% year-over-year and this of course is on a GAAP or floating FX basis. Google Search and other advertising revenues were 27.2 billion in the quarter, up 17% year-over-year, reflecting ongoing momentum in mobile and desktop.
YouTube advertising revenues were 4.7 billion, up 31% year-on-year, driven by substantial growth in direct response and ongoing healthy growth and brand advertising, which remains the largest component. Network advertising revenues were 6 billion, up 8% year-on-year led by growth in Google Ad Manager.
Turning to Google Cloud, including GCP and G Suite. Revenues were 2.6 billion for the fourth quarter, up 53% year-over-year, driven by significant growth at GCP and ongoing strong growth and G Suite. The growth rate of GCP was meaningfully higher than that of cloud overall. GCP growth was led by our infrastructure offerings and our data and analytics platform.
We also saw strong uptake of our multi-cloud Anthos offering. Ongoing growth in G Suite continued to reflect growth in both SMB and enterprise segments and both seat count and average revenue per seat. The other revenues line now consists of Google Play followed by hardware and YouTube’s non-advertising services, mainly at subscription offerings, YouTube premium, YouTube music, and YouTube TV.
In the fourth quarter, other revenues were 5.3 billion, up 10% year-over-year, primarily driven by growth in YouTube and Play offset by declines in hardware. YouTube's contribution to other revenues benefited from subscriber growth across its various offerings. Within Play, app revenues had strong growth driven by an increase in the number of active buyers.
Total traffic acquisition costs were 8.5 billion or 22% of total advertising revenues and up 14% year-over-year. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was down year-over-year, reflecting once again a favorable revenue mix shift from network to Google properties. Google operating income was 11.5 billion, up 20% versus last year and the operating margin was 25%. Google accrued CapEx for the quarter was 6.6 billion, reflecting investments in data centers followed by servers and office facilities.
Moving on to the performance of Other Bets. For the full-year 2019, revenues were 659 million, up 11% versus 2018, primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. Operating loss for Other Bets was 4.8 billion for the full-year 2019 versus an operating loss of 3.4 billion in 2018.
Let me conclude with a few observations on the quarter and our longer-term outlook. Based on the strength of the U.S. dollar to date relative to the first quarter of last year, we expect continued FX headwinds again in the first quarter of 2020. With our expanded revenue disclosures this quarter, I’ll talk about the revenue and investment outlook for each of these newly disclosed component parts.
First, with respect to search and other advertising. Although we don't report search revenues on a fixed FX basis, the delta between fixed and floating growth rates at the Alphabet level is a good proxy for the effect on search revenues or a headwind of approximately 2 percentage points in 2019. At our scale, we are pleased with our rate of growth for 2019 and see ample opportunity going forward.
What's exciting for us as we look ahead at Search and other Google properties is the ongoing opportunity to support users and advertisers with new ads experiences and improved measurement. Second, with respect to YouTube advertising, at a year-on-year growth rate more than 30% in the fourth quarter we’re pleased with the ongoing strength and opportunity at YouTube.
We see substantial continuing opportunity is in direct response, as well as with brand advertisers. As Sundar shared earlier, the non-advertising services at YouTube, mainly from subscriptions reached a $3 billion revenue run rate in the fourth quarter. We continue to invest across YouTube to grow over the long-term. In the ad supported proportion of YouTube, we pay out a majority of revenues to our creators, reflected in our content acquisition costs.
On top of that, there are other expenses, including infrastructure and networking costs, as well as the costs of our content responsibility efforts to keep YouTube safe for users, creators, and advertisers. We’re also investing meaningfully to grow our subscriptions, which have higher content acquisition cost ratios.
Turning next to Google Cloud. We are very confident that there is an enormous opportunity here that plays to our core strengths. We’re pleased with the growth trajectory of GCP, which we see in customer momentum, the growing size of the average contract, and of course revenues. The traction we’re having with large customers for making multi-year commitments with us is reflected in our backlog, which ended the year at 11.4 billion substantially all of which relates to Google Cloud.
Given our position as a challenger, we’re investing aggressively focused on building out our go-to market capabilities, executing against our product roadmap and extending the global footprint of our infrastructure focused on 21 markets and six industries. In terms of hardware, as Sundar noted in his opening remarks, we remain focused on the long-term opportunity with ambient computing.
We believe our strengths in AI and software give us an advantage in providing seamless experiences to users wherever they are across multiple surfaces. We have been investing heavily in developing our capabilities in hardware engineering, as well as building out supply and physical distribution chains and we’ve created a multibillion-dollar revenue business in the past three years.
We’re looking forward to our acquisition of Fitbit, which will add strong capabilities in wearables and advance our vision of ambient computing for the android ecosystem. As we look at the near term product roadmap, we continue to execute at a measured pace. In other Bets, we are sharpening our focus on the metrics and milestones against which capital allocation is determined, and we continue to assess where external capital is additive to governance and execution.
I’ll now turn to the investments we’re making in headcount and in CapEx to support the growth opportunities we see across Alphabet. With respect to headcount, in 2019, Alphabet headcount grew by 20%, reflecting investment in key areas such as Cloud. Overall, we expect the growth rate of headcount to be slightly higher in 2020, due to the combined impact of investment in priority areas, plus the decision to move certain vendor functions in-house, as well as from the planned impact of the Fitbit acquisition.
On SBC, as a reminder, our full year equity refresh grants are made to employees during the first quarter of 2020 and you will see the step-up in our first quarter results. In terms of CapEx in 2020, we intend to increase our investment in both technical infrastructure and office facilities versus 2019. Within technical infrastructure, the investments in particular support ongoing demand for machine learning across our business, as well as for Cloud, Search, Ads, and YouTube.
Relative to 2019, we anticipate relatively more spend on servers then on data center construction. At this scale of investment, we remain very focused on driving efficiency through fleet optimization and tight management of our supply chain.
Finally, on capital returns. In the fourth quarter, we repurchase $6.1 billion of shares, which was more than double the amount of repurchase in the fourth quarter of 2018. As of year-end, we had $21 billion remaining in the program and our focused on executing on the remaining authorization at a pace that is at least consistent with what you saw in the fourth quarter.
In conclusion, we remain very confident about the opportunities across Alphabet and in our ability to continue to deliver at the steady pace we have shown. Sundar and I will now take your questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Hi. Thank you very much Sundar and Ruth and I guess, I'm sure you're going to hear this a million times tonight, but thank you so much for the enhanced disclosure of, I think this is the best Google call or Alphabet call I have been on since I’ve covered the company. So, thank you again. You’ve given us a lot of stuff here. I just wanted to focus a little bit on GCP and the comments that you made and either if you want to think about this for Google Cloud collectively or just for GCP, just given the revenue run rate that you are at, how do we think about the gross margin profile of this business, is it fair to look at some of the other Cloud players when they were disclosing similar run rates to get a sense for what their gross margins were? Or is there a reason why your business might look slightly different? Thank you so much again. Thank you for those comments. First and foremost, we’re obviously really pleased with the momentum here. GCP had fantastic revenue momentum in the fourth quarter and as we noted is growing at a meaningfully higher pace than Google Cloud overall. In terms of your margin question, look, I think our view is obviously the competitive dynamics and the Cloud market are very different today. We are investing aggressively given the opportunity which I tried to make clear in opening comments.
Given the opportunity we see and the momentum we’re having, we’ve accelerated our investment in our go-to-market team and as we’ve talked about before we’ve set a goal to triple the size of the sales force. We’re also focused on building out our product road map and extending the global footprint of our infrastructure. And I will leave the forecasting to you. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your line is now open. Thank you so much. Maybe two parts if I can. Sundar, to you first – a lot of innovation that company put on display over the past year, Ruth talked in her sort of forward commentary section about sustainability of growth and outperformance going forward. What are you most excited about when you see the company trying to align, what improves consumer utility along with what continues to drive growth in the various segments of the business? That would be number one, and two, Ruth maybe for you, you had talked about variability of revenue last quarter going into Q4, but unless I missed that, I don’t think you used the same word again in Q4, what were you expecting in terms of variability in Q4 and any color you could give on how that played out or how we should be thinking about variability of revenue going forward? Thank you so much. Eric, I think overall, I presume you're meaning across everything we do, and if that’s the case, I am – I mean the trends we are seeing and we’ve been investing on it for a while, but applying it and actually driving used cases to users. So, for example, you know using AI to dramatically improve natural language processing to make 10% of our search results better is a kind of opportunity I’m excited by.
When I look at – we do see a lot of commercial experiences across our properties, be it Search or YouTube and the opportunity to create a better experience there and hence bring more value to our users. That’s something which we see as a big opportunity. And across our businesses be it YouTube, Cloud, Play, or hardware in addition to search, you know we are seeing strength in a lot of these areas and we share a common technological approach across all of them. And so that gives us a synergistic way to approach these areas as well. And then on your second question, at our scale, we're pleased with the rate of growth in 2019 here in Search and our ads business overall and we do see ample opportunity ahead. When we talk about variability of revenue, the way we've talked about it in the past very much holds true, which is where we don't manage for any particular quarter. We manage focused on what's in the best for users and with a lot of testing that goes around it. And so really the point is there will be variability and we're focused on continued – the continued long-term opportunity and we do see that opportunity, the ads opportunity to be significant.
Apart from the secular shift to digital, we continue to be very focused on the benefit from better measurement, better ad delivery, better user experience, our view is that all helps grow the addressable market, but there will be variability over time because we're very focused on what's in the right long-term interest. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks for taking the questions. One for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar, first, just hope you could talk more about Google Cloud. Great to see the $10 billion run rate. Just curious if you can help gauge the progress over the past year, and then where do you think the biggest areas of differentiation-why in an increasingly competitive space? And then Ruth, can you just give some of your latest thoughts on balancing growth and profitability across the Google segment and Other Bets? And as you enter this year, do you see additional opportunities to drive increased profitability without impacting the long-term potential of the businesses? Thanks. Doug, on Cloud, I think maybe a few thoughts on some of the progress we made last year and talk about the differentiation, which you asked about as well. Definitely under Thomas' leadership, I think we have clearly focused on six industry verticals across 21 markets and so doubling down on those efforts, bringing in a lot of new products and compliance certification, so effectively expanding the TAM, which we serve. Ruth mentioned, the team is on track to triple our sales force in three years, including bringing in a number of senior strategic hires and supplementing it with a channel partnership program.
I think the progress I've seen in our customer focus – with our customer success organization and the contracting framework have all been great progress for us. Overall, every time we are, especially in one of these larger deals, they are effectively looking for a technology partner. So, differentiation is not just what we bring to table in terms of Cloud, where we have differentiated capabilities, but in many cases, it's what we bring as Google. So, if you take an area like healthcare, all the investments we are making in healthcare across Google, and in some cases, Alphabet.
If you look at Sabre, the partnership we can bring to them across our experience working in travel verticals as well. So, I think – and over time, I also think the AI-based, industry-specific solutions we are working on will end up being a differentiating factor as well. And in terms of your second question, investing for growth and how we balance growth and profitability, the approach to capital allocation and the pace of investing continues to be guided by the same three drivers that we've talked about previously. First and most important is investing to support the long-term earnings growth and the opportunities that we see there. Second, we do remain focused on optimizing investments within each product area. And then third, as we've talked about on prior calls, is investing to support operational excellence and that includes things like driving efficiencies in our technical infrastructure, which I spoke about.
When we look at the biggest investment areas within Google, we, as we've talked about already on this call, continue to be focused on investing to support the growth that we see. It starts with Search, while also investing to build new businesses and we've talked about a couple of them already today. Cloud is clearly an area where we're investing aggressively.
In Hardware, we've been investing heavily by developing our capabilities in hardware engineering, as well as building out supply and physical distribution chains. And then in YouTube, as I mentioned in opening comments, we do continue to build out our subscription services. It's still in the early days there and we're making a sizable investment to build it out, taking a long-term view here.
So, we are leaning into investing for long-term growth. That's been a core principle here and remains such while looking at where can we optimize within portfolios and where can operational efficiencies be additive. Great. Thank you both. Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Thanks for taking my question. I have two. Just, Sundar, I thought your 2020 focal points are really helpful, creating the most helpful products for everyone and then the most trusted experience for users. I was curious to kind of focus in those comments on payments in YouTube. You've had a lot of payment strategies over the last couple of years. So, talk about what types of investments or products you think you need to really remove friction and drive better payment adoption. And then on the YouTube side, if you sort of look at how people are using YouTube now from an engagement perspective, what types of changes do you foresee you need to make in order to really make it a more helpful product to drive engagement even higher on the YouTube platform? Thanks. Brian thanks. On the payment side, clearly I spoke earlier about the kind of experiences people see across our properties, including people do come with an intent to discover, learn and commercially engage as well, and when they're looking to transact, payments ends up playing a critical role. So the less friction you have, it tends to work better. So, we've been really focused on doing that and getting more of our users set up in the right state.
We've had a lot of traction with our payments product over the past 18 months. We had a tremendously successful launch in India from which we learnt a lot of features, and we are bringing that and we are revamping our payments products globally. And so I'm excited by that rollout, which is coming up in 2020. I think that will make the experience better.
On the YouTube side, I guess your question is about how are users engaging with the product. Overall, all our user metrics are very strong. They're global in nature and increasingly we see newer verticals beginning to grow as well. So, YouTube is working horizontally well at scale. And for us, it's making sure, as an ecosystem, it works better so that the content there, the experiences there are improving.
We take our content responsibility work seriously, which makes more content creators engaged and makes it a more valuable product for advertisers as well. But also supplementing the content you see there with other types of accessorizing things, be it merchandising, ticket sales. When we make it contextually relevant, what we have done in Search and search ads over time, if we can bring that to YouTube when we see an opportunity, I think that sets us up well for the long term there. Great. Thanks. Thank you. And our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Thanks. Ruth, in North America, was there anything that was abnormally unusual? Facebook had cited some weakness in North America. It looks like your North America number was relatively weak versus the last four years. Is there – was there any anomaly that we should be aware of? Thank you. Thanks for that. So, the regional breakdown also reflects product mix within regions. The U.S. year-on-year growth rate does reflect a decline in Hardware revenues relative to what was a fairly strong Hardware revenue growth rate in 4Q 2018 and not much more to call out than that. Thank you. And our next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Thank you. So, Sundar I guess some of the more cross product line synergies are showing up in an integrated software and hardware effort with the stuff like the Pixel, but you've come up through the ranks at Google, so you're undoubtedly pretty sensitive to the various interests across various teams, but we're wondering what you may be looking to do to break down, I guess, what might have been more of a siloed effort in Google's history? Thanks. I think – I spoke about execution at scale. And so for us that means, you have these product areas, which are focused on their users, but we are setting up teams which cut across all these areas and make sure they can bring their synergies and work at scale. So, last year, we set up a core infrastructure team, which looks at things like how does the user journey work across, what does the shared infrastructure engineers can use so that we don't reinvent the wheel in multiple areas, how can we commonly deploy AI across all these products? So, I think that's been a good example of bringing teams together.
Another big area where we invested like that to break down silos is our partnerships. We set up a global partnerships team. And our ability to bring a common Google perspective to our big global partners has helped us strike many new partnerships. I mentioned Activision Blizzard as an example. And they work and they're very synergistic with Cloud as well. To my point earlier, when people engage with us on Cloud, they're looking for – they're interested in a bigger digital transformation across the board.
Google Assistant is a great example of – because we are focused on the user and the experience cuts across several of our product areas. It's been a great mechanism, by which we can break down silos as well, but it's a great question and I spend a lot of time on it. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. I had two questions. One clarifying one for Ruth and then maybe a big picture one for Sundar. Ruth, you distinguished between the growth of brand advertising and direct response on YouTube. Those comments were very clear. I just want to follow up and ask you just, how you make that distinction between brand and direct response. Is it different pricing model? Is it the presence of ad revenue share with a creator or both? Would just be curious on that distinction? And then to Sundar, the big picture one, we have heard others in the ecosystem talk about headwinds from targeting growing. Certainly, there are regulatory changes that also apply to you. You've made some changes to various Google advertising platforms. And of course, you're an owner of two of the largest, most important platforms in Chrome and the Android operating system. I could ask you a billion things on that last one, but what I'd really like to ask is the big picture question, if we roll up these sort of things for your total advertising business, how important are changes here to your top line growth? Are you seeing notable headwinds from these types of changes in the ecosystem as well? Thanks. So, on the first one, we have again this quarter talked about brand and direct response. And as we've talked about in prior quarters, brand is growing at a healthy pace and remains the largest component of YouTube ads. Direct response is growing – continues to grow at a very substantial growth. The distinction here is the format for – in direct response, we're letting brands insert a tailored call to action in a video ad, such as signing up for a newsletter or scheduling an appointment or downloading an app or booking a trip, things of those sort. That's why it's the direct response category. And on the broader questions about headwinds, it's something we always need to take a look at. We try to stay focused on users and our partners and we realize for these things to scale, you need to make sure the ecosystem is working well. And so we are engaged in these issues and we anticipate and structurally work on them early on. So, it's how we broadly approach these things. And so there's nothing notable to call out other than there will be continued changes in these ecosystems and our ability to anticipate and adapt is key to the years ahead. Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Great. Thank you. I'd like to ask a couple of bigger picture things on the new disclosures. So, first on YouTube monetization, assuming you have about 2 billion users, it's about $7 or $8 per user. Just wondering how you feel about that monetization level given all the usage you're seeing there, and is there significant room to raise that when you compare it to other social networks? And then secondly, on the Cloud backlog, a very strong number at [11.4], versus our IaaS/PaaS revenue rates, just wondering about how strong the new deals have been that you've signed in the last six months? It sounds like really good traction there, and then the profitability of these deals, how do you feel about that? Thank you. On the question on YouTube, I do think there is a lot of opportunity ahead. You're right; it's a platform working at scale. I think – Ruth spoke a little bit about brand and direct response. I think direct response is a huge growth area for us. And increasingly, I think when you look at the fact that people are consuming a lot of goods and services as part of their experience in YouTube, how can we create better commerce experiences also is a big opportunity for us. So, looking across, I think, there is more room, significantly more room, over the mid to long term on monetization levels. And so I think we see that as a big opportunity and are investing for it.
On Cloud, definitely we are increasingly doing much larger deals. And these deals can sometimes span beyond Cloud as well and they can touch many areas. So as an example, if you're an automotive company, we can be talking to you across Cloud, Android Auto, in some cases, Waymo, and they all happen to be strong platforms – partners on the advertising side as well. So, these are large deals, and we do want to build these in a sustainable way so that we can serve the partner well, and so profitability has been something we are very focused on as well. And just to add a little more to that, where the $11.4 billion backlog number is for us, we view it as a way to quantify the traction that we're having. And as you know well, in the enterprise phase, these tend to grow over time, and profitability as such comes across the cohorts. However, the point that we were trying to make and have made a couple of times here on the call is we are investing aggressively in Cloud overall given the opportunity that we see and the momentum we're having and we'll continue to do so. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Youssef Squali from SunTrust. Your line is now open. Okay. Great. Thank you. Two quick ones. First, Ruth, has the shortened holiday season had much of an impact on your Search business in North America? And then, Sundar, as you talk about automation, machine learning, AI, how much of advertisers' search spend is now on auto bidding? And how do you think smart bidding is effective – is affecting spending growth and pricing? Thank you. So, on the holiday shopping season, there is really nothing to highlight there. What we find is there are seasonal puts and takes in any given period, so really nothing to note. On – I don't have specific numbers here, but – to add here, but effectively, we do see significant traction in these areas and advertisers are leveraging the features we have, we are bringing it here, be it smart bidding, auto bidding, there's tremendous traction with our advertisers here. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Kevin Rippey from Evercore. Your line is now open. Hi. Thanks for taking the question. This is primarily for Sundar. As you think about the risk profile of some of your businesses like Waymo, like Verily in healthcare, how do you manage those risks, which likely in a scenario where autonomous cars have some accident or something like that, having those in-house and perhaps brand damage that could do to Google versus what you could do if those were entirely separate enterprises? I know they're all held underneath the Alphabet umbrella, but just sort of big picture how you think about managing that risk over time? Thank you. Thanks, Kevin. We are – as I spoke earlier in the remarks, part of the reason we are making sure we are investing in the proper governance structures so that we don't try to scale as a management across these important areas. Some of these are – have regulatory aspects to it. We are, for some of these bets as well, and Verily is a great example, we have brought in outside investors, people with expertise and setting up proper board structures and governance for these.
So, I think those all help and we'll continue to evaluate these on a periodic basis and bring that rigor and discipline, but I do think Alphabet gives us a more flexible framework, if you will, to both have the independence when we need, but where we can have common shared synergies, like our AI investments, bring that to bear as well. Thanks. Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC. Your line is now open. Hi. This is Ben on for Mark. Thanks for taking the question. Ruth, I just kind of want to double click on something you said before in terms of Other Bets kind of like a sharpening focus on the allocation there. Was that kind of – is that kind of signaling more of the same or is that kind of potentially maybe prioritizing investments more toward like share buybacks and stuff like that as opposed to – like basically I'm trying to ask should we expect greater rationalization in the Other Bets segment going forward or is it more of the same? Thanks a lot. So, what I was saying is that when we look at the Other Bets and execution, we've talked over time about measuring them against specific metrics and milestones, operating, business, technology, financial performance. And we look at that as we calibrate the pace of investment, the approach to investments and we are continuing to do that.
We're putting a sharper focus on this, as Sundar indicated, looking at where does it make sense to work with external capital as we did with Verily as an example, but the bigger point is, we continue to invest for the long term, and when we look at our capital return approach, it's very consistent with what we've talked about previously. The primary use of capital continues to be to support long-term growth in Google and in Other Bets, and then it's about strategic investments and on top of that return of capital to shareholders. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler from Barclays. Your line is now open. Hi. Yes, two questions. The Google segment margin looked really strong in the fourth quarter. I think this is the first time that mix shift actually helped you guys from a margin perspective. So Ruth, can you just talk about how much of that margin increase year-on-year was from the Hardware business dropping off versus improving elsewhere? And then as you look forward, you mentioned that headcount is going to accelerate in 2020. So, is this an investment year in your view or just kind of more of the steady kind of increase? And then second question, on YouTube a lot of discussion here about direct response impact and the opportunity there. What percent of AdWords advertisers are buying Search only versus buying Search and YouTube at this stage? And it looks like from your new disclosure that YouTube decelerated a little bit in the fourth quarter. Any color on what's driving that relative to the full year 2019 growth rate? Thank you. Okay. So, taking the first part of that. In terms of the operating margin in the fourth quarter, there were a number of discrete items in the fourth quarter last year in 2018. So that did result in a favorable Google op inc year-on-year comparison for this year. And as you said, the other cost of sales does reflect lower expenses related to Hardware in Q4, in particular, versus last year, but I think the main point to leave you with is that we do intend to continue to invest aggressively to support growth in the areas that we've already talked about quite a bit on this call, in Search, in Cloud, in Hardware and in YouTube.
In terms of headcount, I tried to break it out in my closing comments that it starts with those areas – putting headcount behind the areas where we're investing for the long term. And then we have a couple of additional factors that are somewhat expected to boost the year-on-year growth rate. One is bringing some support in-house that's OpEx neutral, and the other is the Fitbit acquisition. In terms of the third part of your question, I'm just trying to recall it. The – in terms of the mix, I'm not sure there's much to add there. Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian from Baird. Your line is now open. Thank you. I guess, first, just given the focus and new leadership team in commerce, was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the opportunities you see for innovation there at the transactional part of the funnel. And then as a quick follow-up on the acceleration in GCP, beyond the size of the deals, were there particular product areas like BigQuery or something else worth calling out that might have inflected to drive that acceleration? Thank you. Great. On commerce, I'm really excited Bill Ready is here. He brings a lot of experience. And he mentioned the transactional part of the funnel and I think it's an area where he brings a lot of experience given his prior work, but we definitely see opportunity to improve the overall user experience in terms of how we present our results, the visual nature of it, making that experience more delightful. And when people are interested in something, how do you make it more seamless to complete the transaction and bringing in deep partnerships with merchants and retailers to making that happen. So, excited about the opportunity there and that's where we are investing.
On GCP, we did see – it's been a lot to do with bringing to bear all the resources we have and engaging well on these deals and the execution there has been great. And it's – definitely, we see strong traction in data analytics. And so, our strength there as a company is definitely contributing significantly, as well as our overall leadership in AI. Thank you. Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ellen West for any further remarks. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter 2020 conference call. Thank you, and have a good evening. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.","all participants are in a listen-only mode, followed by a question-and-answer session . with us today are Sundar Pichai and Ruth Porat . a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included .",1.0

And welcome to the Alphabet First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you, Candice. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet’s first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai and Ruth Porat.
Now, I’ll quickly go over the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations and financial performance, including the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on those areas, may be considered forward-looking and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC and in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 expected to be filed with the SEC later today.
During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today’s earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor.
And I’ll now turn over the call to Sundar. Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. When I last spoke with you in early February, no one could have imagined how much the world would change and how suddenly. Our thoughts are with everyone who has been impacted by COVID-19, especially those who have lost loved ones or their livelihoods. It’s a challenging moment for the world.
Through it all, we are incredibly grateful for all of the essential workers on the frontline of this crisis. From healthcare workers and first responders, to the grocery store clerks and delivery workers, to teachers grappling with new technology to help children learn remotely, to all the scientists and researchers working hard to develop vaccines and treatments, and many others who are leading through these difficult times. Thank you.
These people fill us with hope and show us the power of human resilience. We’ll need that energy and resolve in the months and years ahead. Today, there is still a great deal of uncertainty regarding the path to recovery. But there are some things that we can understand better with the patterns we are seeing. For example, it’s clear from data that people are being more cautious and are seeking authoritative advice and guidance to protect their family’s health and safety.
A return to normal economic activity depends on how effectively societies manage the spread of the virus. There is no one-size-fits-all, and the timing and pace of recovery will vary from location to location. This is a long-term effort. It’s also clear that this is the first major pandemic taking place in a digital world.
Many parts of the economy are also able to continue with some semblance of normalcy. Thanks to advances in remote work, online shopping, delivery options, home entertainment and telemedicine. At the same time, newer technologies like AI, Bluetooth exposure notifications and 3D printing are being used to help fight the disease head on.
It’s now clear that once the emergency is past, the world will not look the same. Some social norms will change and many businesses are speaking to us, looking to reinvent their operations. We have seen that the most pressing concern of small and large businesses right now is business continuity, solving for issues like employee safety, dramatic falls or surges in demand, supply chains and managing a remote workforce.
Ultimately, we’ll see a long-term acceleration of movement from businesses to digital services, including increased online work, education, medicine, shopping and entertainment. These changes will be significant and lasting.
Given the depth of challenges so many are facing, it’s been a huge privilege to be able to help people and businesses at this moment. In today’s call, I’ll cover 4 areas. First, I’ll mention some of the ways we have marshaled our resources and product development to help. Second, I’ll talk about how people are using our products at this unprecedented moment. Third, I’ll talk about our business, especially our advertising business, which was significantly impacted in the last few weeks of the quarter. And I’ll close with our investment plans and focus for the rest of the year.
In the early days of the crisis, we were able to put in motion a number of efforts quickly. This is a testament to strategic areas where we have invested over recent years, products that people trust, our technical leadership and innovation, deep partnerships, a highly skilled workforce, and the scale and resilience of our operations.
I’ve been proud of all these efforts and what they say about our company. I’ll give just a few examples. First, we’ve been working with healthcare providers, researchers, authorities and communities to help combat the virus. Our Community Mobility Reports help authorities see in aggregate how social distancing requirements are working.
Verily has tested thousands of people in California and has partnered with Rite Aid to bring free testing to 8 additional states. Good Cloud is forming deep partnerships, such as with leading healthcare provider, HCA Healthcare to understand data around ICU bed availability, ventilator supplies and test results.
And you may have read about our exposure notification partnership with Apple, designed specifically and carefully to protect users’ privacy, while helping public health authorities and governments manage countries reopening. Second, we are working hard to provide accurate and authoritative information to people using our services.
In Search, we have launched a number of features, such as up-to-date answers from health authorities and remote medical care options. On YouTube we are quickly removing content that violates policy, and raising authoritative content from news organizations and experts.
Up to last week, our COVID-19 info panels have had 20 billion impressions. Third, we are playing a role in supporting businesses and workers that are hurting because of the downturn. In March, we made a commitment, upwards of $800 million to support small businesses and crisis response efforts through a combination of grants, small business loans and ad credits.
And the Google News Initiative is offering financial support to thousands of small, medium and local news publishers through a Journalism Emergency Relief Fund. We have also waived ad serving fees for news publishers globally on Ad Manager for the next 5 months.
Turning to the way people are using our products. People are relying on Google services more than ever. This is a strong recognition of the value of our products, particularly in important and urgent moments. As a few examples, we have seen a significant raise in search activity. To put it into perspective, in the U.S. coronavirus related search activity at its peak was 4 times greater than during the peak of the Super Bowl.
People are spending significantly more time on their Android apps with downloads of apps from Google Play rising 30% from February to March. YouTube watch-time has also significantly increased. One area in particular is live streams. I hope you saw Andrea Bocelli on YouTube live on Easter, which just had over 39 million views and it was truly beautiful.
100 million students and educators are using Google Classroom, double the number from the beginning of March. We have seen a massive increase in demand for Chromebooks. Analysts have reported 400% increase during the week of March 21 year-over-year. And schools and businesses in particular are using our secure video conferencing platform, Meet.
Last week, we surpassed a significant milestone and are now adding roughly 3 million new users each day and have seen a 30-fold increase in usage since January. There are now over 100 million daily Meet meeting participants. Stay tuned for much more.
Turning to our business, let me touch on our performance this quarter. Q1 was in many ways the tale of 2 quarters. For our advertising business, the first 2 months of the quarter were strong. In March, we experienced a significant and sudden slowdown in ad revenues. The timing of the slowdown correlated to the locations and sectors impacted by the virus and related shutdown orders.
As the impact of COVID-19 came into view, we delayed some ad launches and prioritized supporting our customers as many adjusted their strategy. We are focused on products where we can help most advertisers and merchants during the crisis. For example, under our new leader of commerce, Bill Ready, last week, we announced that merchants can list products in Google shopping for free. It’s been widely rolled out in the U.S. with more countries to come and the response has been positive.
Overall, recovery in ad spend will depend on a return to economic activity. There are 2 key aspects of our business that give us confidence about the future. First, as we saw after 2008, one of the strongest features of Search is that it can be adjusted quickly, so it’s relatively easier to turn off and then back on, and marketers see it as highly cost effective and ROI based.
Second, our business is more diversified than it was in 2008. For example, Cloud. In the public sector, we are helping governments delivered critical health and social services. We are supporting the state of New York, new online unemployment application system as it deals with a significant increase in demand.
In retail, we have held Loblaw, one of Canada’s largest food retailers, and Wayfair, scale to support exponential traffic increases. We are helping communication companies adapt to new behavior patterns. Vodafone is using Google Cloud platform to help that analyze network traffic flows to keep everyone connected, and we are helping Unity Technologies keep real time online games stay up and running.
Institutions like Lloyds Bank are digitally transforming their businesses, and we are helping even more businesses do the same to new partnerships with Accenture, AT&T and T-Systems. We now have more than 6 million paying G Suite customers. G Suite is helping Netflix and German manufacturer, Kaeser Compressors, transition quickly to remote work, while Twitter, Shopify, Retailer Schnucks and Italian bank Credem are using Meet for things like all-hands and customer meetings, elsewhere across the business.
YouTube subscriptions continue to grow, the team has launched YouTube Kids in 15 new countries around the world since the beginning of the year and rolled out new features to make kids focused channels safer.
Android previewed Android 11, which includes seamless 5G connectivity and a smarter keyboard with a faster messaging experience. And as I mentioned, we have seen significant growth in play. There are now over 2.5 billion monthly active play devices worldwide. And in hardware, we saw a decline in device activations in the quarter due to falling customer demand globally. But I’m excited about the product roadmap ahead for the year, including yesterday’s launch of Pixel Buds 2.
Finally, moving on to our focus for rest of the year. We are taking a long view and continuing to invest in our long-term priorities, but are being thoughtful in the short-term. So we made the decision to slowdown the pace of hiring in the reminder of 2020, while maintaining momentum in a small number of strategic areas.
We are also recalibrating the focus and pace of our investments in areas like data centers and machines, and non-businesses essential, marketing and travel. We’ll also continue to thoughtfully manage our Other Bets portfolio. Waymo raised $2.25 billion in its first external investment round, a terrific validation of their technology and long-term business model. Wing saw a surge in deliveries and new users, increasing its daily volume fivefold with great momentum in test programs in Australia and Virginia.
At Google, we’ll continue to be focused on the 4 key areas that I outlined in the last earnings call. First, creating the most helpful products for everyone, particularly at a time where people rely on us for information, work, education and entertainment. Second, providing the most trusted experiences for our users. This includes our efforts to tackle misinformation and digital threats as well as our work to safeguard consumer privacy.
Third, executing at scale, I’ve been proud of how we continue to work so cohesively and productively even with the distributor workforce. We’ll continue to build on the internal tools, support systems and infrastructure we have built over the years. And finally, creating sustainable value, we’ll be optimizing the way our data centers work and prioritizing strategic areas of investment where we need to support our users and partners.
Let me express my thanks to our employees for their herculean effort under these difficult circumstances. While the road ahead for everyone is uncertain, we’ll continue to support our users, communities and partners and will all emerge together from this moment. Thank you and please take care, everyone. Over to Ruth. Thanks, Sundar. Our results for the first quarter are a tail of 2 quarters with strong results across our revenue lines for January and February followed by an abrupt decline in March in our advertising revenues, as governments globally instituted stay at home orders in response to COVID-19. At the same time, even through March, our non-advertising revenue lines maintain their strong performance, particularly Google Cloud. I’ll provide more details on the impact of the crisis as I review the Google segment revenue results and conclude with an update to the outlook that I shared on our fourth quarter call. Sundar and I will then your questions.
Starting with consolidated Alphabet results. In the first quarter, our total revenues were $41.2 billion, up 13% year-on-year and up 15% in constant currency, driven by Search, YouTube and Cloud. Details of Alphabet’s consolidated revenues by geographic region are available in our earnings press release. In short, advertising results reflect, in large part, the nature and timing of actions around the globe in response to COVID-19.
The decline in APAC was more muted than what we have seen in the rest of the world given the uneven impact of COVID as well as the composition of our revenues in the region. The impact in the rest of the world began later and was more acute by the end of the quarter. In terms of the foreign exchange impact, exchange rate movements resulted in a modest headwind to reported revenues.
Regarding our key expense lines, on a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues including TAC, was $19 billion, up 19% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $11.5 billion, up 26% year-over-year primarily driven by Google-related expenses. The biggest factors here again this quarter were costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation, and then content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube’s advertising supported content followed by content costs for YouTube TV and our paid YouTube music and premium subscription services.
Operating expenses were $14.2 billion with headcount growth being the largest driver of year-on-year growth for R&D and sales and marketing expenses. For G&A, the biggest driver of expense growth was attributable to a reserve for estimated credit deterioration as a result of COVID-19.
Stock-based compensation totaled $3.2 billion. Headcount was up 4,149 from the fourth quarter. Again the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were again in Google Cloud for both technical and sales roles. Operating income was $8 billion, down 4% year-over-year, excluding the impact of the EC fine in the first quarter of last year for an operating margin of 19%.
Other income and expense was a loss of $220 million driven primarily by losses in equity securities. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Our effective tax rate was 11.9%. Net income was $6.8 billion, and earnings per diluted share were $9.87.
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $6 billion, which I will discuss in the Google segment results. Operating cash flow was $11.5 billion with free cash flow of $5.4 billion. We repurchased $8.5 billion of our shares. We entered the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $117 billion.
Let me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with our Google segment. Revenues were $41 billion, up 14% year-over-year. I’ll now go through the individual advertising revenue lines. Starting with Google Search and other advertising revenue, we generated $24.5 billion in revenues in the quarter that was up 9% year-over-year. This reflects strong year-on-year growth for the first 2 months of the quarter.
In March, revenues began to decline and entered the month at a mid-teens percentage decline in year-on-year revenues, although, users’ search activity increased, their interest shifted to less commercial topics. In addition, there was also reduced spending by our advertisers.
YouTube advertising revenues were $4 billion, up 33% year-on-year. Significant YouTube revenue growth persisted until late in the first quarter with different performance trajectories for the brand and direct response components. Direct response continued to have substantial year-on-year growth throughout the entire quarter. Brand advertising growth accelerated in the first 2 months of the quarter, but began to experience a headwind in mid-March. As a result by the end of March, total YouTube ads revenue growth had decelerated to a year-on-year growth rate in the high-single-digit.
Network advertising revenues were $5.2 billion, up 4% year-on-year with healthy year-on-year growth for the first 2 months of the quarter. We ended March at a year-on-year percentage decline in network revenues in the low-double-digits.
Turning to Google Cloud, including GCP and G Suite. Revenues were $2.8 billion for the first quarter, up 52% year-over-year, driven by significant growth at GCP and ongoing strong growth at G Suite. Once again, the growth rate of GCP was meaningfully higher than that of cloud overall. GCP growth was led by our infrastructure offerings in our data and analytics platform. We’re pleased with the ongoing growth in G Suite, which continues to reflect growth in both seat count and average revenue per seat.
With respect to the implications of the global crisis for Google Cloud, we’re proud of the accelerated traction we achieved across sectors, including public sector and healthcare for disease monitoring and control, working with leading retailers on demand forecasting working with companies across media and communications to enhance their customer service and across industries on supply chain optimization.
In the first quarter, other revenues were $4.4 billion, up 23% year-over-year, primarily driven by growth in YouTube non-advertising revenues and play. YouTube’s contribution to other revenues benefited from subscriber growth across its various offerings. Within Play, app revenues continue to benefit from strong growth in the number of active buyers in the first quarter. In addition in the latter part of the quarter we started to see an increase in user engagement in apps as well as in digital content.
Total Traffic Acquisition Costs were $7.5 billion or 22% of total advertising revenue and up 9% year-over-year. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was down slightly year-over-year, reflecting once again of favorable revenue mix shift from network to Google properties.
Google operating income was $9.3 billion, up 1% versus last year and the operating margin was 23%. Google accrued CapEx for the quarter was $5.7 billion, reflecting investments in data centers followed by servers and office facilities.
Moving on to the performance of Other Bets, for the first quarter, revenues were $135 million, primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. Operating loss was $1.1 billion for the first quarter.
Let me now conclude with our thoughts on the impact of the global crisis on our revenues and investments including an update on the outlook I shared on our fourth quarter earnings call. We remain optimistic about the underlying strength of our business over the long-term.
On a daily basis, our products play an important role for consumers and businesses globally. This has been evident throughout the crisis and the usage metrics that Sundar referenced earlier. We’re humbled that users continue to turn to us as much as they do and a time of global need and uncertainty. We take that responsibility very seriously.
Users clearly are depending on us to provide useful and accurate information. They are looking to YouTube for information, education and entertainment constantly as they study, create and work from home. They are using our G Suite products to collaboratively communicate, connect and work.
Although users may not be focused as much on purely commercial activities right now, over the long term, the value we provide to billions of users globally serves us well. Our previous investments in technical infrastructure ensure that we have the capacity and resilience to meet the increased demand from our users in this extraordinary time.
We are redoubling our efforts to help our advertising customers and partners by sharing insights and developing new tools to keep them connected to their customers and help them be best positioned for recovery. In terms of more specific product points, I will start with Search advertising where our financial results are driven in part by users’ search behavior.
At the inception of the crisis, the increase in user interest was for information about COVID-19 and related non-commercial topics. Although we have seen some very early signs of recovery and commercial search behavior by users, it is not clear how durable or monetizable this behavior will be.
In order to gauge the ongoing potential financial impact to our business from COVID-19, a key signal to monitor is macroeconomic performance which is tended to be correlated with advertising spend. As of today, we anticipate that the second quarter will be a difficult one for our advertising business.
As we move beyond the crisis and the global economy normalizes, this should be reflected in our advertising revenues. But it would be premature to comment on timing, given all the variables here.
In terms of Google Cloud, we remain very pleased with the execution by the team, reflected in the ongoing pace of customer adoption of both GCP industry-specific solutions and G Suite collaboration tools to help businesses operate efficiently and effectively.
Moving on to profitability, while TAC and content acquisition costs are obviously tied to revenues, there is a sizable percentage of items in other cost of revenues that are generally less variable in nature, such as depreciation and operations costs of our technical infrastructure as well as for activities like customer support and content review.
Much of our operating expense is also not directly correlated to changes in revenues. Given that we are faced with a global crisis of uncertain depth and duration, we have been focused on taking steps to enhance efficiency, including slowing the pace of hiring in some categories of marketing spend as well as further enhancing machine utilization.
More specifically, with respect to the pace of hiring, last quarter, I indicated that the rate of headcount growth in 2020 would be slightly higher than the 20% growth in 2019. We now anticipate a deceleration in headcount growth that should start to be visible in the third quarter and continue into the fourth quarter.
Although we are focused on these and other steps to moderate the overall pace of investment, we remain committed to the long-term opportunities for which we are well positioned, so we will continue to invest in these areas, including Search, Machine Learning and Google Cloud.
Finally, with respect to CapEx, on the fourth quarter call, we shared our expectation that investments in both technical infrastructure and office facilities would increase compared to 2019. We now anticipate a modest decrease in the level of total CapEx in 2020 compared with last year.
The biggest change in our outlook is the reduction in global office facility investments, due to both the need to pause most of our ground-up construction and fit-outs in response to COVID-19 and our decision to slow down the pace at which we acquire office buildings. In terms of technical infrastructure, we expect a moderate reduction to our forecast relative to the beginning of the year, given the impact of COVID-19 on data center construction delays, as well as the benefit of our ongoing focus on server efficiency.
Overall, we anticipate technical infrastructure investment to remain at roughly the same level as in 2019 with relatively more spend on servers than on data center construction.
Thank you. And Sundar and I will now take your questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your line is now open. Thanks for taking the question and hope all is safe and well with everyone on the team there at Alphabet. 2 questions if I can. One, on the comment with respect to direct response advertising on YouTube, would love to get a little more color on how direct response advertising’s ad units continued to evolve and perform, and how advertisers are using those ad units as part of their broader advertising goals.
And then maybe, Ruth, for you, on the comment on expenses, just want to understand a little bit of how much of what your messaging on expenses is efficiency gains that you were aiming for in 2020 before we got to COVID-19 versus elements of the cost structure that you’re reexamining as a result of the pandemic. Thanks so much. Eric, thanks, thanks for the wishes. On YouTube direct response, we’ve definitely seen traction there. I think an area where it really works well for example is app installs, it’s a great example of it. Gaming is another good example of it. And we are working on iterating and making the format work better, so that it applies to more contexts as well.
But, in general, I think businesses are learning to adapt. Obviously, we’ve had great success with Search and so we’re bringing a lot of those learnings and we’re sharing it with our customers. And so, we expect to see more traction there over time. And on your second question, I like the way you framed it. Yes, we do have efficiency efforts that we started, that we had going as we enter this year. But as a result of what we’re seeing in the environment, our view was that we should really double-down on those. And so, when we go through the various areas that I mentioned, we had started the year with an expectation about really optimizing headcount around the various areas.
What we’ve determined is we’re going to at this point slow the pace of hiring. To be very clear, we are continuing to hire, but we are slowing the pace of hiring. And that’s helping as we’re driving a deeper look into how do you optimize within each area. The same is true for example in some of the comments on marketing.
We are continuing to invest in marketing. As you know well, sales and marketing line, the majority of it is headcount related and we do continue to invest here in ads, and in particular, in Cloud. As it relates to the marketing component, namely ads and promo spend, we did reduce it relative to our plans in the beginning of the year. And we continue to have a healthy budget for ads and promo, particularly in digital to support many business areas.
But as with the other areas of investment, we’re really focused on optimizing across products and services. And with physical events canceled for much of the year, marketing spend is also reduced. And so, that’s another example. With machines and servers, we’ve been focused on efficiency of the fleet for some time now. This is giving us the opportunity to push that even further.
So we’re looking at the operating environment and saying we should continue to lean into the efficiency programs. We can. It does help us free up some resources for the growth areas that continue to be a priority, but it is an accentuation of where we were. Thanks so much. Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks for taking the questions. One for Sundar, one for Ruth. First, Sundar, you just talked about how once the crisis has passed, the world will not look the same. I’m curious if you can just elaborate a little bit more on how you think Alphabet comes out stronger on the other side of this downturn.
And then, Ruth, maybe taking the question on expenses a little bit further, did this give you any more opportunity to be even more disciplined or diligent on costs on the other side as well? Thank you. Thanks, Doug. It’s a good question. And we are thinking deeply about it as well. In general, I would say the highest level opportunity is, across everywhere we see, businesses thinking deeper about the shift to digital. And that’s true across marketing, cloud, in – every place we see that trend. And so part of this is making sure our investments deliver value with respect to that shift.
So if you look at advertising, people who in the past may have debated things like how do I get virtual showrooming, now are really thinking about it. People who may have been hesitant to shift their budgets, do – are looking through moments like this and trying to get all that working better.
Cloud is an obvious area, every company has been thinking about digital transformation. But they are asking the questions deeper. For example, if you have data centers, there are fixed costs through something like this. And you learn going through moment like that and you’re thinking about the opportunity harder.
So across everything we do, be it Search, be it YouTube, be it Play, be it Cloud, I think we are investing to capitalize on this long term opportunity. And I would say overall on Alphabet as well when you look at investments like a Waymo and Wing, you can imagine in the future these things working well can play a significant role. And even in the limited area [as Lingus and] [ph] we clearly saw its potential through a moment like this, so we’re betting on those big trends. And to your other question, if I understand it correctly, you’re asking about the durability of some of the efficiency efforts. I think that the way I would answer that is, after a decade of growth there have to be opportunities for added efficiency. And we’ve been focused on that for some time. But painful times like this put a spotlight on an urgency around taking – making sure you’re focused on the levers that you have.
And hopefully, those instill the right kinds of health metrics et cetera against which you’re managing. So I would say that the intent most certainly is that these are durable investments to ensure that we’re operating as effectively and efficiently as we can be. And I just need to reiterate. And Sundar and I have both said this. We remain committed to investing for the long term, so we’re not compromising where we need to invest for long-term growth. We’re trying to make sure that each dollar of investment is well managed. Thank you, both. Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. Ruth, I have 2 questions for you actually. First, I wanted to thank you for the color around the growth you’re seeing as you were exiting the quarter in the ad business. And there’s been some signs from different partners or different companies that ad spending whilst down considerably has actually improved a little bit, maybe some green-shoots from the declines that you might have been referencing at the end of March.
Any chance you can give us a sense of the type of growth you’ve been seeing for the first kind of 3, 4 weeks for the quarter, just to help level set us. And then, just in regards to the provision you mentioned in G&A related to credit deterioration, is there a chance you could tell us the amount of that provision? And do you expect to have to do this again in the second quarter? Thank you. Thank you for the – so, in terms of ads revenue, as I said in opening comments, for our ads business a key signal to monitor is macroeconomic performance, which has tended to be correlated with ad spend. And I think it’s premature for me to comment on the trend. In terms of what we saw in the first quarter, as I said, for Search and other revenues, they were up 9% year-on-year for the quarter.
But in March, revenues began to decline and then ended the month at a mid-teens percentage decline in year-on-your revenues. And then, with YouTube, we had strong revenue growth until late in the quarter when trajectories for direct response and brand diverged. And as I said, direct response does continue to have substantial growth throughout the quarter while brand began to experience a sizable headwind starting in mid-March.
So by the end of March total YouTube ads revenue growth had decelerated to year-on-year growth rate in the high-single-digits. And then, for the second quarter so far, you know what, I think it’s premature to gauge, given uncertainty in the environment. And a few weeks, obviously, is not a quarter. So in such an unprecedented crisis, I would not want you to extrapolate from just a couple of weeks.
That being said, the decline in our Search and other ads revenue was abrupt in March and although we’re seeing some early signs at this point that users are returning to more commercial behavior, it’s not clear how durable or monetizeable that will be. So based on our estimates from the end of March through last week for Search, we haven’t seen further deterioration in the percentage of year-on-year revenue declines.
For YouTube, direct response has remained strong. However, we’ve seen a continued decline in brand advertising and it’s really too early to add more. I think that the main point though is a few weeks obviously is not a quarter and given it is such an unprecedented environment, I would not extrapolate from these comments for the full quarter. And then I’m sorry you had the second question on the… On the G&A, sorry, no, that was very helpful so thank you on behalf of everybody. And then just the G&A that you mentioned the credit provisions that you said you took, I just was wondering if you could share the amount it might be in the queue later tonight, but wondering if you could share with us the amount on the call? It will be in the queue later tonight. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson, your line is now open. Thanks. I have one for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar, people have asked you about your priorities you talked about, but I wonder if you could step back and think about what this crisis will do the other side and maybe a reorienting of your priorities so perhaps where you would shift spend in the long-term to maybe take advantage of where this is going? And then Ruth we appreciate the color on YouTube, just want to dig in some more, if you can give us any sense of YouTube geographies is there any difference by change by geography that is really helpful? So, thanks. In terms of overall priorities, I would say, we’ve always taken a long-term – on thinking through the arc of where things are going and our deep focus on AI, it’s an example of that and we’ve been convinced for a while that those trends will play out in the long-term and so if anything through moments like that, the strong foundation we have built allows us to continue to be able to invest in our long-term area so AI is a good example of it.
The shift over time on computing to ambient computing is something we’re going to be deeply committed to and continue to invest there. Cloud and productivity software for businesses of all sizes is a deep area of investment and so the thesis still main so we continue to focus anywhere we think the actual work we are doing is based on deep technology, deep computing, a deep computational scale is the kind of investments we think still stand the test of time through things like, but beyond that we are actively looking at how user patterns are emerging so, for example, e-commerce is an area and you saw us respond through this with the changes we announced on our shopping property and going for comprehensiveness there and with new leaders in place we’re going to be making sure we work on the user experience there.
And so we are looking at shifts be it videoconferencing with Google Meet and G Suite and adapting and investing in those areas as well so that’s how we are approaching it. And then in terms of the geographic breakdown for You Tube, we kind of bring that down, although I think as you know, well, we have a breakdown for the major regions around the world and to give you a little more color there, in mid February revenue growth across the business began to decelerate in APAC, although as I noted the decline in APAC was more muted just given the uneven impact of COVID and the nature of our business across the region and then the impact in EMEA was first evident in mid February with a steeper falloff in March. In the second week of March we then saw results in the U.S. as well as other Americas fall off shortly, but nothing more specific by product. Okay. Thank you, Ruth. Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, Ruth, just to go back to your comments around the early signs of improvements in behavior and search, I know it’s early in doing over extrapolate, but just any more detail on the types of behavior you’re seeing, which verticals or which categories or which geographies were you seeing sort of the first sign of green shoots on the Search side.
And then Sundar, just to go back to your comments about the shift toward digital opportunities or digital transformation, if you talk to us about as you sort of look back over the last couple years at what you’ve done on the SMB side and what are sort of one or two of the key hurdles where you see you really need to invest and build more comprehensive SMB products for post recovery? Maybe I can give color both on the SMB and a bit on that side too. On the SMB side, it’s an area we have been investing for a while and obviously we have assets both across AdWords, Google Maps, Google My Business and obviously providing them with G Suite and the tools to get their business running. So, I do think we have a lot of touch points, but the focus has been simplifying it, making it more of a one cohesive easy experience making sure it works well from mobile that there is a truly lighter weight AdWords experience so that they can get on board it quicker and so reducing the work they need to and also over time bringing technologies like AI to just make it all much simpler and seamless for them.
And it’s going to be a continued focus for us and especially scaling this up and making sure it works internationally well as well we have clear metrics and targets internally and we are aligning the teams better to get there and you would see us do more.
On the Ad side, a question – to your question about maybe I can give more qualitative cover to what was said earlier and we – the good thing about search ads and direct response on YouTube as well, but Search primarily is that, it’s an extraordinarily effective system, it’s a transparent system, you have a very clear sense of ROI, it’s very measurable, highly cost-effective and so we have always seen and we saw this in 2008 as well, people respond in the short-term, but the recovery is also fast when it comes back and so it tends to work. It is very diversified not just geographically by different verticals and even through moments like that we do see businesses responding to demand shift and so we see through our system if people suddenly are looking for office furniture or even pajamas, the system response, right and so you see the dynamic nature of it.
I mentioned earlier people are really thinking about the shift to digital so Philip and our ads team are super engaged with our customers helping them think through the opportunities through moments like that. I gave a earlier example, if you are thinking about cars and you’ve been hesitant to do virtual car showrooming, now is the time you’re beginning to have those conversations in a deeper way.
There are budgets, which are shifting in certain cases, some of our large customers, may be they’ve spent a lot of money on live sports that is clearly on hold so they’re looking to shift some of those budgets into opportunities they see, but having said that there are large sectors of the economy, which are affected, things like travel and our large partners and customers are impacted and so we clearly see the impact of that and that’s the color Ruth gave as well. Great. Thanks, Sundar. Thank you. And our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Good afternoon. I’m curious if you could just give us a little more color across SMB and enterprise, any common threads you saw between those two segments? We have had tremendous momentum on the G Suite and we can – all of Google works this way, products like Gmail, Google Docs that are built from the ground up to really help people be productive and collaborative in a distributed work environment and so we’re clearly seeing traction there. Google Meet, have seen great traction and I gave – I mentioned some user momentum there, but we have more announcements coming up including later this week and so we are seeing tremendous traction and engagement on G Suite.
On Cloud, the shift to digital has been deep trend and if anything people are really engaged on it. I earlier talked about, you can imagine, if you’re a customer and you have data centers, these are fixed cost when you go through moments like this and so people are really looking at opportunities there and so our teams are super engaged, but I do want to acknowledge, maybe small businesses across the world are deeply impacted.
As a company we have announced several efforts to support small and medium businesses and we are going to be deeply engaged with them, but I think it’s a tough journey we are all on and we look forward to working with them to help them through this. Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Sundar, I wanted to return to those long-term initiatives that you walked through earlier and one that was most close to your core business and the changes that you – were announced this week for shopping. Could you explain a little bit more about the reasons for making those changes and expanding the free listings or creating the free listings and what drove you to make that decision now? And then a related follow up for Ruth, same question essentially, but as we think about the financial impact of such a change, imagine this is one of those things, which may qualify as causing maybe some variability in the quarter-to-quarter rate, but something that benefits all parties over the long-term, I think is how we’ve often visited these sorts of changes, but any color you could add on sort of the near and long-term impact of the Google Shopping changes would be great too? So, going through a moment like this, it’s very clear, part of what makes Google work well is, people come across a diverse range of needs and that’s true for shopping. They spend time discovering and comprehensiveness really matters that’s how we can have a great user experience and so as we’ve been thinking about this space, we realize and this is how our organic search works, for us to truly give that comprehensiveness and the quality of experience.
We need the widest catalog possible and then we are good at ranking it and providing and matching users to what they are looking for. And so it is – it made a lot of sense for us and just looking through the range of experiences people who are seeking through the COVID pandemic validated it even more and obviously we’ve been executing really hard there with leadership in place and so we saw the opportunity to go back to our first principles and improve the comprehensiveness there.
One of the tricky things about when you do that is making sure you don’t have spam and you’re managing and giving people good quality experiences and that’s where our deeper partnership, be it with PayPal and other providers so that we get the quality signals and really improve the experience as we improve comprehensiveness so both of them are going hand in hand and as we have demonstrated with Search, when we improve the organic experience the advertising experience also gives an opportunity and the system works well and so I’m really excited about this change. It is still early and but it’s been very positively received and you’re going to see us enhance the experience in this area deeply.
While we talk about shopping another area where we are investing and building the right foundation is at Google Pay and we have great leadership there as well. We’ve been executing well over there for the past year and the growth on Google Pay has been strong and so being able to bring all of that together along with strong players like PayPal et cetera will help us give great experience for our users here. And in terms of your question about the financial implications of the effort, there’s really not much to add here today I would just say, re – echo Sundar’s comment, we’re excited to have the – leading the effort, and as Sundar said at the outset, one of the priorities is creating sustainable financial value and we have a leader who has a demonstrated track record of doing that so we’re excited about what he is building here with the team. Okay. Thank you both. Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Great. Appreciated all the advertising updates in March, just wondering your cloud growth is obviously quite stable in the low 50’s, any impact in March on workloads or a slowdown in the new customer pipeline? And then maybe Sundar, if you could talk about what could be the benefit for cloud as we get to the other side of this more work from home or just other things and secular changes in cloud that might come about from this? Thank you. Overall on cloud the interest in the momentum remains strong, we’re obviously making a lot of progress both across GCP and G Suite and we find our offerings are getting deeper and we’re really helping customers from a deeper standpoint so we see overall momentum. There are cases where even though the deal trajectory is the same and we have the wins. Things are taking a bit longer, naturally as you would expect.
Our customers are impacted for moments like this too so I would say, time to closing some larger deals are impacted. But the companies, if anything, all the way at a CEO level, are thinking about the shift to digital in a deeper way. And I think that’s a longer term trend we are excited about.
Obviously, consumption gets impacted depending on the sectors which companies are in. And so that has some correlation with the general underlying performance of that sector. And so, that’s something we’ll have to wait and see how it develops. But the teams are doing well and it’s an area where we are committed to the course we are on and investing deeply for the long run. Then you asked about kind of Q2. Nothing to highlight there, I’d just reiterate what Sundar has said. We’re really pleased with the Q1 performance for both GCP and G Suite. And the dynamics affecting cloud are obviously very different than those from ads. And just to build on Sundar’s comments with little more on G Suite and some of our opening comments, in this work-from-home environment what we’re seeing is significant interest from governments and companies looking for work-from-home solutions.
So just to add one more example, Cambridge Health Alliance is a U.S. health system with a 140,000 patients. And they relied on G Suite to support their staff and caregivers during COVID-19, helping them connect across hospitals, health centers from home. And it’s just yet another example of how we’re able to be present, helpful, useful in this time. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Kevin Rippey from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Hi, thanks for taking the question guys. One for Sundar and then one for Ruth. Sundar, the question for you really relates to the resiliency you’re seeing within direct response piece of YouTube, like are there specific factors or is it a question of mix of advertisers there, that’s sustaining the growth?
And then the question for Ruth, you highlighted that this has given you an opportunity to refocus on cost discipline. It looks like that the capital returns by way of buyback remain quite strong in the quarter. Has this affected your thoughts on buybacks and capital returns going forward? Thanks. Maybe stepping back, I would say, we are overall seeing strong momentum on YouTube. People are turning to YouTube. Our watch-time has increased across the board. People are also looking for our authoritative news content. Viewership on YouTube has increased significantly compared to last year or two.
So in many ways through the pandemic, people are using YouTube. And the trends are global across North America, EMEA and Asia Pacific as well. On direct response, I do think, I think people are – it’s a journey, and people who have been investing are seeing that it is cost effective, and so, over time more people are looking at it.
Our sales teams are doing an excellent job of helping our customers understand the opportunities there, and so being able to bring all of that to bear. In the case of App Campaigns, we have done it with Universal App Campaigns. So we’ve just made it easier as a customer, not to think about whether you’re trying to do this across Search or YouTube. And bring a simple holistic solution, so all of that is impacting.
I mentioned gaming earlier. When you think about things like unboxing and product reviews, those are natural home for transactions as well. I earlier mentioned about all the work we are doing now on commerce. All of that, I am looking forward to those integrations coming into YouTube and working better as well.
And so, those are some of the longer-term opportunities. We are working hard to get the experience right and building the right foundation for the future. And then on your second question on capital returns, we believe a share repurchase program for us appropriately sized is responsible on the current environment based on our capital allocation framework and our cash balance. So in the beginning of the year, I indicated that we expected to repurchase shares at a pace at least consistent with the fourth quarter on the remaining authorization and that remains our view for the second quarter. Thank you and our final question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC. Your line is now open. Okay, thanks. In terms of the – maybe less worse or somewhat positive trends at the end, you mentioned this recovery or modest move up in consumer commercial search queries, have you also seen a small improvement in advertiser interest in running campaigns? I think you said both of those factors kind of deteriorated in March.
One of them came back. Did the other come back too? Did you also see advertisers starting to come back? And then, secondly, the YouTube result in the March quarter was phenomenally strong given what happened in the month of March to YouTube. Is that a comp issue? Was the comp much easier? It sounds as like January, February could have been up strong 40% year-over-year. So is there any color? Is that just comps, easy comps, or was there something that fundamentally changed that cause that kind of material acceleration? Thank you. So as I tried to be really clear in my response to others’ question, I would not extrapolate from my comments for the full quarter. It’s early, just giving you an early read and there’s really not much more to add than what I indicated, so nothing more to add there. And then, in terms of… Yeah, maybe just to reiterate what was said earlier and I said that Search tends to – people respond to changes in Search faster, brand trail. So brand is maybe slower to change both on the downside and the upside. And Search is much faster to adapt as well. And so I think that’s worth keeping in mind. But overall, look, we see a vibrant system. Advertisers are definitely very engaged and looking at it. And we are seeing active conversations between our teams and our large advertisers, where they’re trying to understand the demand shifts and how they can respond.
And so, overall, I see the – both from users, users are engaging with Google, YouTube and our core products and services. And while, obviously, there’s an impact on the economy and we’re not immune to that, the engagement from advertisers across our products and with our teams has been very robust. Thank you and that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I’d like to turn the conference back to Jim Friedland for any closing remarks. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today.

[Operator Instructions]. I'd now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai and Ruth Porat. Now I'll quickly cover the safe harbor.
Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations and financial performance, including the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on those areas, may be considered forward-looking. And such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC and in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 expected to be filed with the SEC later today.
During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. And now I'll turn the call over to Sundar. Thank you, Jim, and thank you, everyone, for joining in. It's certainly been a busy week, and I'm glad to be here. I hope everyone is staying safe and well. All of us at Google continue to send our deepest gratitude to everyone on the front lines of the pandemic all around the world. I also want to personally thank all our employees who continue to work so hard to make sure our products and services are available for everyone right now. People looking for important health information, hard-hit businesses working to inform customers about opening hours or delivery options or teachers connecting to their students. The macroeconomic environment caused by the pandemic created headwinds for our business. Our revenue declined on a reported basis and is flat year-over-year on a fixed FX basis. Like other companies, this quarter, we saw the early signs of stabilization as users return to commercial activity online. This is true across most of our advertising verticals and geographies. Of course, the economic climate remains fragile.
One thing I'd like to call out is our continuing journey to invest in and grow new businesses. We delivered strong growth in our non-ads revenues particularly from Cloud, Google Play and YouTube subscriptions. This, in turn, is helping our partners, developers and creators earn revenue and deliver valuable services to people. We are focused on the steps to build long-term value with these opportunities.
Today, I'll review the quarter by walking through the 4 key areas for 2020 that you heard me mention over the last several quarters: creating the most helpful products for everyone; providing the most trusted experiences for our users; executing at scale; and creating sustainable value.
First, creating the most helpful products for everyone. This has been especially important during this time. We are focused on providing locally relevant, helpful and authoritative information about COVID in over 70 languages in 200 countries. This has been an enormous effort across search and all our products. YouTube, for example, engage with public health officials in over 90 countries and services panels with locally relevant information in response to COVID-19 queries.
On Google Maps and Search, we now display more than 12,000 COVID-19 testing centers across 20 countries, working with local governments and data providers to source accurate and helpful information. Using our technical capabilities, we are helping people find more information about local businesses such as takeout, curbside, updated hours, donations, gift cards and virtual services.
With more kids at home, Google Play launched a special kids tab with only teacher-approved apps and YouTube has seen traction with learn at home as well as a virtual summer camp for kids called Camp YouTube, plus a virtual commencement series.
To help Indian Internet users, we announced a Google for India Digitization Fund. Through this effort, we'll invest approximately $10 billion over the next 5 to 7 years to accelerate and participate in India's burgeoning digital economy. We'll enable information in local languages and apply technology and AI to important areas like health, education and agriculture. Jio platforms is the first partnership agreement in the fund and will work with them to help millions of users in India become owners of smartphones.
Second, providing trusted experiences for our users. Doing even more to protect users' privacy, keep information safe and provide high-quality information was a key focus this quarter. In one important update, we now set people's location history and web in-app activity to delete automatically after 18 months as the default. We also integrated password checkup into our core security checkup to help people detect any instance of their online accounts being compromised. More than 100 million people have used it. Android 11 Beta launched this quarter with many new features to help people better manage their connected devices. It contains a significant focus on privacy and security, including more granular control over app permissions and restrictions on app's usage of background location. Our exposure notifications API for Android and iOS, developed with Apple, launched this quarter. It's designed to empower public health agencies to create apps to help fight the spread of COVID with the strongest user privacy safeguards.
As of today, authorities have rolled out official apps in 12 countries to alert people that they were in contact with another person who tested positive for the virus and that they should isolate and get tested. We expect several more apps to launch in the next week or 2, including the first state apps in the U.S. We are also focused on election security efforts around the globe, whether it's removing coordinated foreign influence operations, prevent hacking and phishing attempts or enforcing our political ad policies that require transparency and prohibit narrow micro targeting.
Moving on now to executing at scale. All businesses are adjusting to work-from-home and we are no exception. While building products across distributed teams was new for us, this experience allowed us to make good use of our infrastructure investments and productivity tools. G Suite products, in particular, Google Meet have been absolutely critical, and we quickly reengineered it and made it available widely to help millions of other businesses and organizations connect and collaborate.
One area where we have executed really well to improve the user and merchant experience in the last year is shopping. We know that we and merchants face incredible competition for consumer attention and wallets. We are helping merchants lower their costs and improve their reach in a few ways. They can now list their products for free on the Google Shopping tab and on Search helping them drive more traffic and making our results more comprehensive and useful. We also recently announced that sellers on Buy on Google will no longer pay us a commission fee. Plus, we are giving retailers more choice by opening our platform to third-party providers, starting with PayPal and Shopify. Shopping ads also continue to be a great tool for merchants with new visual features for retailers such as smart shopping campaigns that let customers know about free shipping. We are continually adding more ways for advertisers to reach shoppers.
Now let me talk about our fourth area, building sustainable value, which is all about driving business value for our partners and investing smartly in new areas. In our advertising business, our focus is on helping businesses find customers as they work to rebuild and recover. We gave search advisers the ability to add high-quality images to their ads, helping shoppers quickly see products to consider and take action faster. We added features to make video ads more easily shoppable and browsable on YouTube as more businesses are shifting to online to offset physical store closures. For SMBs, we are proud that so many are taking advantage of new features, including Smart Campaigns to reach new online audiences and promoted pins on Google Maps to let customers know that their businesses are open. And to empower businesses to understand in an easy and visual way, what products people are searching for, during the special circumstances that COVID-19 has created. The rising retail categories, too, surfaces fast-growing product-related categories.
As I mentioned earlier, beyond advertising revenue, we see good traction in areas such as YouTube subscriptions, Google Play and Cloud. YouTube Premium Music and TV subscriptions performed well during the quarter. We are seeing strong demand for these services and are adding content regularly, including many Viacom networks like BET and Comedy Central. In Q2, Google Play app and game downloads were up more than 35% year-over-year, which means that revenue for developers continue to grow.
Let me go a bit deeper on Cloud. In the first half of 2020, technology and innovation proved to be a significant recovery mechanism for businesses. Those who are shifting to digital and embracing the spirit to innovate are evolving and growing. Our commitment to bringing innovative products to market, building and scaling our go-to-market organization, and strengthening our partner network helped us continue to meet the growing needs of our customers this quarter. We see 2 distinct trends as businesses embrace the future of work.
First, the future of business will be more digital. Customers are choosing Google Cloud to either lower their cost by improving operating efficiency or to drive innovation through digital transformation. Brands like Keurig Dr. Pepper, Deutsche Bank, Lowe's, Telefónica, Orange and Group Renault. And we are helping many government agencies deliver care for their citizens, including the states of Oklahoma and New York here in the U.S., and Italy and Spain in Europe.
Second, the future of work will be more collaborative. Virtual collaboration is critical in order to adapt and succeed in the changing global landscape. In Q2, we saw continued demand from customers using G Suite to help their employees work from home, including Wipro in India and expanded our relationship with the state of Arizona here in the U.S. Our customers are using G Suite tools across industries in new ways, whether it be financial advisers working with clients, doctors and nurses turning to telemedicine or teachers educating students with remote learning. In Q2, we peaked at more than 600 million Meet participants in a single week. As one example, PwC employees reached nearly 10 million hours of video conferencing in Google Meet in a single month. To make collaboration easier for everyone, we introduced an integrated workspace for Gmail, Chat, Meet and Drive on mobile and desktop. Our Cloud product strategy is differentiated and our investments in direct sales and indirect distribution are beginning to deliver results.
Before I move to Other Bets, I want to note that our hardware team continues to make good progress, and I'm excited by the new upcoming devices we have coming this fall.
And finally, in our Other Bets. Waymo announced that Fiat Chrysler automobiles will work with Waymo as its strategic partner for L4 autonomous technology across our full portfolio. We also entered into a partnership agreement with Volvo Car Group to work together to integrate the Waymo driver into an all-new electric vehicle platform for ride-hailing services. Finally, Waymo closed its externally-led investment round, bringing the total funding to $3.2 billion, which includes investment from Alphabet. And Wing's drone delivery service started delivering library books to students in Virginia.
In closing, it's an important and uncertain time in the world. We are all grappling with the pandemic and a struggling economy, while also reckoning with centuries of injustice that affect our Black communities every day. John Lewis' funeral today provides a timely reminder of the struggle. In June, we announced a significant package of commitments to help our Black+ community internally at Google as well as the wider Black community. This included product experiences that matter to Black users, including the option for business owners to identify their business as Black-owned in Google Maps and search. We also announced $175 million economic opportunity package to support Black business owners, start-up founders, job seekers and developers. In addition to YouTube's $100 million fund to amplify Black creators and orders. We commit to contributing to long-term meaningful change, both externally and within Google. And with that, I'll now turn it over to Ruth. Thanks, Sundar. We are cautiously encouraged by our results for the second quarter, although mindful of the fragile global economic environment. Our advertising revenues gradually improved through the quarter, and our non-advertising revenue lines maintained their strong performance particularly Google Cloud and Play. I will begin with a review of the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year-over-year changes. I will then review results for Google, followed by Other Bets and conclude with outlook. Sundar and I will then take your questions.
Starting with consolidated Alphabet results, our total revenues in the second quarter were $38.3 billion, down 2% year-on-year and flat in constant currency. Year-on-year declines in our advertising revenues from Search and Network were offset by growth in Google Other and Google Cloud revenues. Details of Alphabet's consolidated revenues by geographic region are available in our earnings press release. Across each region, we saw a gradual improvement in revenues in the quarter with some differences reflecting product mix. In terms of the foreign exchange impact, exchange rate movements resulted in approximately a 2% headwind to reported revenues.
Regarding our key expense lines. On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, was $18.6 billion, up 7% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $11.9 billion, up 18% year-over-year primarily driven by Google-related expenses. The biggest factors here again this quarter were costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation and then content acquisition costs primarily driven by content costs for YouTube TV and our paid YouTube Music and premium subscription services, followed by costs for YouTube's advertising-supported content.
Operating expenses were $13.4 billion, up 7% year-on-year. Headcount growth was the largest driver of year-on-year growth for both R&D and G&A. Secondarily, the increase in G&A reflects contributions mainly for COVID response and reserves for estimated credit losses of our customers. The year-on-year decline in sales and marketing expenses was due to lower advertising and promotional spend as we paused or rescheduled campaigns and pivoted to digital formats for flagship events. All 3 categories benefited from lower T&E expenses. Stock-based compensation totaled $3.3 billion. Headcount was up 4,450 from the first quarter. Again, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were again in Google Cloud for both technical and sales roles.
Operating income was $6.4 billion, down 30% year-over-year, and our operating margin in the quarter was 17%. Other income and expense was $1.9 billion, which primarily reflects an unrealized increase in the market value of equity securities. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release.
Our effective tax rate was 15.9%. Net income was $7 billion, and earnings per diluted share were $10.13.
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $5.4 billion, which I will discuss in the Google segment results. Operating cash flow was $14 billion with free cash flow of $8.6 billion. We repurchased $6.9 billion of our shares. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $121 billion.
Let me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with our Google segment. Revenues were $38 billion, down 2% year-over-year. I'll now go through the individual advertising revenue lines. Starting with Google Search and other advertising revenues. We generated $21.3 billion in revenues in the quarter, down 10% year-over-year in the aggregate with improvement as the quarter progressed. We saw a gradual return in user search activity to more commercial topics throughout the quarter followed by an increase in spending by advertisers. This resulted in an improvement in year-on-year search revenue trends during the quarter with Search revenues essentially flat to last year by the end of June.
YouTube advertising revenues were $3.8 billion, up 6% year-on-year driven by ongoing substantial growth in direct response offset by a continued decline in brand advertising, which then moderated toward the end of the quarter.
Network advertising revenues were $4.7 billion, down 10% year-on-year with trends improving somewhat toward the end of the quarter as advertisers spend began to return.
Turning to Google Cloud, including GCP and G Suite. Revenues were $3 billion for the second quarter, up 43% year-over-year. GCP maintained the strong level of revenue growth it delivered in the first quarter, and its revenue growth was again meaningfully above cloud overall. GCP growth was again led by our infrastructure offerings and our data and analytics platform. Overall, the lower Google Cloud revenue growth in the second quarter relative to the first quarter reflects the fact that G Suite lapped a price increase that was introduced in April last year. G suite maintained healthy growth in average revenue per seat as well as in seat growth, which does not include customers who took advantage of our free trials as they shifted their employees to work-from-home.
Other revenues were $5.1 billion, up 26% year-over-year primarily driven by growth in Play and YouTube non-advertising revenues. Within Play, app revenues in the second quarter benefited from the impact of very strong growth in the number of active buyers with more people at home looking for entertainment. Within YouTube subscription revenues, we continue to benefit from subscriber growth across its various offerings. Total traffic acquisition costs were $6.7 billion or 22% of total advertising revenues and down 8% year-over-year. Total TAC, as a percentage of total advertising revenues, was up slightly year-over-year.
Google operating income was $7.6 billion, down 26% versus last year, and the operating margin was 20%. Google accrued CapEx for the quarter was $4.8 billion, reflecting investments in servers, data centers and office facilities.
Moving on to the performance of Other Bets. For the second quarter, revenues were $148 million primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. The operating loss was $1.1 billion.
Let me end with our outlook. As I said earlier, ads revenue gradually improved during the quarter across Search, YouTube and network. However, we believe it is premature to gauge the durability of recent trends, given the obvious uncertainty of the global macro environment.
As we discussed on last quarter's earnings call, global macroeconomic performance has tended to be correlated with ad spend and is a key signal to monitor. Over the long term, we remain optimistic about the underlying strength of our business. In terms of Google Cloud, we are pleased with the traction we're having with large customers who are making multiyear commitments with us. This is reflected in the strength of our backlog, which ended the quarter at $14.8 billion, substantially all of which relates to Google Cloud. This performance is a result of the investments we are making into the cloud go-to-market organization. Google Play's Q2 results reflect growth in the number of new buyers with accelerated adoption as people stayed home. Performance also reflects the significant investments we have made in the ecosystem to support developers and users, such as successful promotion and adoption of our partners' apps and games in new locales around the world and expanding the availability of local forms of digital payments.
Moving on to profitability. The decline in our Search revenues put significant pressure on profitability, which was further impacted by our ongoing investments for long-term growth. As I discussed last quarter, much of our expense base, both in cost of revenues and OpEx is not directly correlated with changes in revenues. For example, although TAC and content acquisition costs are obviously tied to revenues, there's a sizable percentage of items in other cost of revenues that are generally less variable in nature, such as depreciation and operations costs of our technical infrastructure as well as for activities like customer support and content review. We remain focused on the user and customer experience, and we'll continue to invest to support our products. .
With respect to operating expenses, although we still expect the pace of headcount growth to decelerate somewhat in 2020, we're continuing to hire aggressively in priority areas like cloud. We still expect that headcount additions will be seasonally higher in Q3 as we bring on new graduates. Consistent with prior years, we expect sales and marketing expenses to be more heavily weighted to the back half of the year, in part to support product launches and the holiday season.
Turning to CapEx. We continue to expect a modest decrease in the level of total CapEx in 2020 compared with last year. This is particularly due to our decision to slow the pace at which we acquire office buildings in the near term as we focus on reimagining the optimal work environment. This also reflects the slower pace of ground-up construction for both our office facilities and data centers due to COVID-19. In terms of technical infrastructure, as we discussed last quarter, we anticipate investment to remain at roughly the same level as in 2019 with relatively more spend on servers than on data center construction and benefiting from our ongoing focus on server efficiency. With respect to capital allocation, our primary use of capital continues to be, to support organic growth in our businesses followed by retaining flexibility for acquisitions and investments. We complement these growth drivers with a return of capital. As we indicated in our press release today, our Board has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $28 billion of our Class C stock. Thank you, and Sundar and I will now take your questions. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from UBS. Maybe two, if I can, for Sundar. One, on the commerce initiatives, a lot of announcements from the company in the quarter, moving towards sort of commission-free and amplifying both the advertising and e-commerce efforts. I want to understand some of the moves you're making strategically and how you think that positions you broadly against, obviously, an e-commerce landscape that's seeing a lot of pulled forward penetration given the current environment. And second on YouTube, obviously, a fairly volatile brand advertising environment and TV advertising remains in flux. What are the opportunities both in the U.S. and globally to go after sort of TV ad budgets under the YouTube umbrella? On Shopping, I spoke a little bit in my remarks, but really excited at the potential there. The team has been executing very well. Overall, users come to Google a lot to find the products they are looking for, but we see an opportunity to invest and make the experience better. Sometimes the journeys may fail because they don't find what they're looking for. So we want to make sure it's comprehensive.
Next when people find what they like, we want to make it simple for them to transact. And so working on that end-to-end experience has been a big focus. And obviously, making sure for merchants, really making sure we are open to business for merchants, and we are giving value to them has been the focus. The early indications are that users are responding positively, both in terms of user engagement and more importantly, giving value back to merchants for their investment there. So in some ways, it's a return to our first principles. We want to ensure that Google is the best place for merchants to connect with users. And so I'm excited by it, and you'll continue to see us focus in this area.
The second was on YouTube brand. Obviously, YouTube has been doing well in terms of engagement and watch time. And so we see a long-term opportunity there. We've had strength on direct response as well through this quarter. But on brand, which was your question, we are obviously investing not just in YouTube main product, YouTube TV as well. And so areas where we can offer a bundle, advertisers are interested in streaming, and so bringing that bundle together, especially to advertisers and upfronts through YouTube Select is a big opportunity as well. So we are focused on that. And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. I have two. Just first, Ruth, curious if you can just talk about the cost structure a little bit more. We know you'll continue to invest to drive growth over the long term. Just curious how you're thinking about it as the top line starts to recover more hopefully over coming quarters. And then secondly, I know you said that search trends were flat to last year by the end of June. Just curious if there's anything you could add in terms of what you've seen more recently over the last month as well. Thanks for this, Doug. So in terms of cost structure, as we talked about last quarter, we have been focused on taking steps to enhance efficiency in the near term. And that being said, as Sundar and I both noted, what you're seeing is the fact that we do remain focused on investing for the long term. So sort of breaking that down in cost of revenues, while TAC and content acquisition costs are obviously tied to revenues, there is a sizable percentage of other cost of revenues that are not directly correlated with revenue growth, as I noted in opening comments, and we are very focused on the user experience and the overall ecosystem. So we are investing to make sure that we're supporting our products so they remain reliable in all environments.
And then in OpEx, much of our operating expense is generally less variable and not necessarily correlating to revenues in the near term. So in terms of a couple of the items, although we do continue to expect the year-on-year headcount growth rate to decelerate, as I noted, we are hiring aggressively in priority areas like Cloud. And so we're taking near-term steps to enhance efficiency but still investing for the long term. So we're trying to make sure that we're getting those tradeoffs right. And as I noted, we do expect the year-on-year headcount growth rate in 2020 to be down somewhat from the 20% year-on-year rate last year, and that's even adjusting for 2 items that put upward pressure on headcount growth. The first, we're moving certain customer support roles from third-party vendors to Google's in-house operation center. That is actually OpEx neutral, but does increase reported spend. And then second, the pending acquisition of Fitbit. So we're trying to navigate it appropriately.
In terms of your second question, in terms of search trends and what we saw throughout the quarter, I would say that following a rough end to the first quarter, ads revenue gradually improved in the quarter, not only in Search, but YouTube and Network. And so for Search, we ended March at a midteens percentage decline in year-on-year revenues. And then as we progressed through the second quarter, we saw a gradual return in user search activity to more commercial topics, and then that was followed by an increase in spending by advertisers. So that resulted in a gradual improvement in year-on-year Search revenue trends in the second quarter. We ended basically flat to last year by the end of June and you know to carry it forward, although we're pleased that ads revenue gradually improved throughout the quarter.
As I said, we do believe it's premature to say, they were out of the woods given the fragile nature of the macro environment. And as you're aware, ad spend does tend to be correlated with macroeconomic performance. And so the macro backdrop will continue to be a key signal to monitor. But to your question, based on our estimates from the end of June through last quarter, there has been a modest improvement in July. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. I just wanted to ask a question on -- two questions related to Google Cloud, if I could. One, Sundar, I was wondering if you could share with us how you've seen the change in pace of customers migrating workloads to the cloud given COVID? And I'm also wondering if you could share with us kind of the puts and takes, and Microsoft talked about this a little bit last week with their Azure business, but for those that have accelerated workload migration to the cloud, how much has that offset the impacted industries or companies that you might be serving where they're seeing lower utilization than what they normally do of cloud capacity? So if you can kind of talk about the puts and takes to the growth as well, that would be great. Thanks, Heather. Overall, from my vantage point, obviously with Google Cloud, we've been investing to scale up, especially on the people side, on engineering, go-to-market and then, obviously on our investment side with data centers, cloud regions and so on. And so for me, it's been good to see as we are scaling up, we are executing more effectively. I've been personally involved in many, many conversations last quarter. We had many large customers come on to cloud, big telco deals and banking deals, Deutsche Bank, as an example. So overall, I felt the momentum was strong. Generally, felt like things were continuing well through the course. Felt like more a secular interest in our digital transformation companies are deeply thinking long term and planning for us. So overall, I felt at the moment, almost there. And I felt our execution as we are scaling up. Obviously, we are scaling up a lot. And so it's -- the combination is working well.
Your second question in terms of puts and takes. Overall, I think there are -- I won't -- I don't know whether there's anything significant worth for me highlighting. Obviously, you are right to point out that it doesn't affect everyone the same, but nothing significant for me to highlight here today. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. I have two. The first one, Sundar, we try to always figure out changes in consumer behavior. I guess as you have sort of been studying what people have been doing through shelter-in-place and from the way things are changing from a consumer perspective, talk to us about areas you're most focused on, investing in and driving your teams to create new products to really help consumers with their changing habits. And then the second one, Ruth, I know as we sort of we look ahead with potentially a larger percentage of the workforce, work remote or work from home, without looking for quantification, maybe just talk to us about some puts and takes to areas where you could see either efficiency or higher potential costs from a larger percentage of the workforce being remote over the long term. Yes. On the first one, when there is -- the shift to online is profound. We see people engaging a lot, doing newer things than they did before. People's interests have -- are broadening, I would say, across the board. And so for example, we are -- for me, I'm looking at different types of user journeys and making sure each of them is getting deeper and better. So for example, in Google, as people have started coming for more health-related information, how is that experience working, thinking about that for the long-term and investing in it. I obviously spoke about Shopping earlier, and that's been a big focus for us. Education in general. And when we think through small, medium businesses and bigger companies thinking through collaboration, where G Suites' potential is, the investments we are undertaking, all that is very exciting to me.
But I would say cutting underneath all that, maybe while we didn't talk about it, really focused on our AI teams doing the investments they need, evolving our next-generation TPUs and the team's building better models and better algorithms. All that, I think, our ability to do more things is something I'm really interested in and focused on as well. So that's something I'm excited about -- for the longer term. And then in terms of your question about work-from-home, I think it's a great point because it obviously feeds so much into a lot of the product work that we're doing in Cloud through G Suite, et cetera. So that's where I would actually start, but I appreciate what you're asking is how are we looking at our own cost base. And we called that out last quarter, in particular, with respect to CapEx, and you can sort of see it here this quarter. The main change in CapEx has really been we slowed the pace on the office facilities front. And what we're looking at is really how to reimagine what the workplace will look like. We continue to be very much focused on the fact that place and space are important. We believe in collaboration. Serendipity is key to innovation. So we do view space in office as important and are very focused on what does that mean over the long term.
We've actually opened quite a number of our offices, in fact, in 40 countries and do hope to reopen in many more. But your question to what does it mean for overall cost structure, we're looking at that with the place you see it now is in our CapEx, and the way we've been looking at it and our indication that we do expect 2020 will be lower CapEx on the facility side as a result. And our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. I was just curious if you could just comment in terms of some of the near-term business trends and anything that's changed as you've gone through the month of July versus what you saw in June? Sure. I already commented on that with respect to Search, but to broaden it a bit more, and again, this is based on estimates from the end of June through last week. So for YouTube, we ended March with a year-on-year growth rate in the high single digits, and that's reflecting a substantial headwind from brand. The headwind from brand moderated modestly at the end of the second quarter, and then we saw a further improvement in July. Direct response has been consistently strong.
For Network, revenues improved toward the end of the second quarter, and we have seen a further slight improvement in July. Obviously, 3 weeks is not a quarter, but that's based on the estimates here from the end of June. And then as Sundar and I both said, when you look at, for example, Cloud, it has maintained its strength consistently. And I'd say that with a business that's growing at this pace, it's really much more about a secular trend to the move to cloud. So really nothing to comment on there. And our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America. Great. Sundar, I don't know how much you can comment on the regulatory environment, but it's obviously top of mind with the hearing yesterday. Maybe just characterize it for Google right now. And are you seeing any progress with the regulatory environment? And then secondly, we saw the YouTube TV price increase, a pretty interesting business model. But longer term, do you see that as really strategically important for the YouTube brand? Or do you think you can have a really profitable business on that? On the regulatory front, we've obviously been operating under scrutiny for a while, and we realize, at our scale, that's appropriate. And we've engaged constructively across jurisdictions. And from my standpoint, I'm confident in the approach we take, our focus on users and in the evidence in almost all areas we operate in. We expand choice or overall lower prices. And it's -- overall, there's a very fast pace of innovation. So it's dynamic and competitive.
Having said that, obviously, we will operate based on the rules. And so to the extent there are any areas where we need to adapt, we will. And as a company, I think we will be, I think, being flexible around those things is important, I think. I think the scrutiny is going to be here for a while, and so we are committed to working through it. On the second question around YouTube TV, yes, there is -- I mean, it's a good question. I spoke earlier about even from a brand and how people think about it, they are interested in streaming. So as YouTube TV gets more scale, I think we will see more opportunities there. We are obviously still in the early stages of building out the product. And just recently, we've added a bunch of new channels and making sure it's working well.
In the U.S., the TV market is a big part of the advertising market, too. So overall, if we can invest here and scale up, I think the synergies with YouTube will become more meaningful over time. And so excited the traction the product is getting. But still too early. And our next question comes from Kevin Rippey from Evercore. This one is for Sundar. I was hoping you might be able to expand on the earlier comment you made about the AI strategy. I'm particularly wondering, if there's been things over the past 5 months since the pandemic began, that you thought an expansion of a very high strategy or an evolution of the past strategy might be able to solve for whether that relates to commercialization or monetization or really anything across the business. Just really, really curious. An area which -- first of all, across the board, the progress is steep. So I'm very happy with the pace at which our R&D on AI is progressing. And for me, it's important that we are state-of-the-art as a company, and we are leading. And to me, I'm excited at the pace at which our engineering and R&D teams are working both across Google and DeepMind. So I'm excited about it. Specifically, we are making good progress in areas like language understanding. And you saw some improvements last year, significant improvements with BERT and Search. But BERT took us a few years to get there. But things like that, I see more stuff in the future. And so excited by it.
An area where I think we are still under-tapped vis-à-vis potential is definitely Cloud. We see the potential there. But -- and I think it's a bit related to Heather's question, too. I think companies are thinking about migrating workloads and so on. But the longer run opportunity of actually using AI to truly have business solutions for you for whatever industry you are in, that feels like there's a lot of potential, and we are still very early there. And so part of it is, for us, connecting the dots internally and bringing it as solutions to our users. We have done it in certain product areas, but I see there's a bigger opportunity in the future. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler from Barclays. Great. I just had two questions. First, on YouTube subscription. So can you talk about the size of that area of the business relative to that $15 billion? We had it at about 15% of total YouTube revenue. And then how is the faster growth in that area relative to advertising impacting your long-term profitability goals at YouTube? And then the second question is on Search. So it sounds like the flat exit run rate year-on-year is pretty encouraging. If we strip out travel, I'm guessing it's well above that. So how would you characterize the query growth versus just the ad auction dynamics outside of travel across the other categories? Are we back to pre-COVID levels in those areas? So in terms of the first question, we haven't broken out the specifics within the YouTube subscription revenues. YouTube subscriptions are in Other revenues, it's not in advertising revenues. And overall, as we think about the opportunity -- our view is -- and we talked about this when we were launching the subscription product, it was really responsive to what we were hearing from users. And as we look at it, music is a key part of the overall YouTube experience. It's an important component of watch time. And what we found is that users wanted -- they wanted choice and some wanted a premium YouTube experience with ad-free viewing and the ability to download songs and videos. And that was really the impetus.
In addition, YouTube Premium provides additional revenue streams for music labels and publishers. So for example, in 2019, YouTube paid the music industry over $3 billion. And what we've done is meaningfully ramp our geographic presence from 5 countries in the beginning of 2018 to 94 countries today. And earlier this year, we announced that YouTube Premium had more than 20 million paid subscribers, up more than 60% versus the prior year. So our subscriber numbers have continued to grow there, and it really was driven by the goal to give users choice. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian from Baird. I guess maybe a follow-up to the earlier question on commerce. Beyond the marketplace functionality and some of the free year promotional transactions, I wonder how some of the other initiatives are going to play a role. And things I'm thinking specifically are, were you focused before on Google Checkout and Maps and some of the assistant functionality, how those may play a changing role in commerce on the Google platform. Yes. Great question. I think the bar is to have that super simple experience, which is delightful and that you have peace of mind and satisfaction in terms of getting the product and being able to return it and so on. So the end-to-end funnel matters a lot. And part of the reason why through the changes, a couple of things we have done. As you saw, we changed and we removed the commission for merchants to be on the platform. And part of it is by removing that. They can take that and invest in, be it shipping, be it delivery, be it the customer experience. And so that matters, matters I think in the overall experience.
And from our standpoint, the Buy on Google experience is something which deeply investing in. Obviously, our integrations with PayPal, our investments are underlying it to make sure for a lot of users that it's as close to a one-click experience as possible is a big part of the investment as well. And our final question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC. I want to ask a broad question about Google. Google's place or position, whatever, in online retail. And I asked this because Google has also -- obviously been central. Search has been central, but also YouTube has been central to commerce, online commerce for the last 20 years. We've gone through this pandemic where there's a real inflection point. We see it in Amazon's results. We see it in Shopify's results. And I'm not sure I see it in Google's results. So just talk about how you think, broadly, Google is positioned for what's really been like a 2 or 3 year pull-forward in accelerated ramp up of online retail demand. And are you positioned the way you want to be positioned now? Are there things you need to make to the -- changes you needed to make the products and services to be better positioned? Obviously, I think as a company, our strength comes from the diverse categories in which we serve users, right? And it's not just product, it's services, it's wide areas, including areas like travel. So it's diversified. And -- but it also means through a pandemic, there are areas of strength, but there are areas of -- areas where you get impacted as well. So I think that's what is reflected in what you see. On e-commerce, you're right, direct e-commerce providers are seeing a big inflection point. But in it are essential categories like groceries and stuff, which are built in, which we don't directly play in. But to us, the reason we are doing this long-term focused effort on shopping with the new leadership team is to precisely make sure as a platform, we are improving and as the shift continues, Google continues to be an important place by which people come and participate in those journeys.
So long run, I see a growth opportunity with related to what we are investing in there as well. Not just through Search, but a Search in the Shopping investments we are making, but in YouTube, and also helping retailers on the cloud side. It's an area where there's naturally a lot of interest to work -- to partner with Google, and so we see that as a big opportunity as well. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any closing remarks. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We know you all have a busy evening. We look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter 2020 call. Thank you, and have a good evening. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I'd now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai and Ruth Porat. Now I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations and financial performance, including the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on those areas, may be considered forward-looking. And such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC and in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2020 expected to be filed with the SEC later today.
During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. Given the busy schedule this afternoon, we've shortened our opening remarks so that we can move more quickly to take your questions.
And now I'll turn the call over to Sundar. Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. This quarter, our performance was consistent with the broader online environment. It's also testament to the investment we've made to improve search and deliver a highly relevant experience that people turn to for help in moments big and small. We saw an improvement in advertiser spend across all geographies, and most of verticals, with the world accelerating its transition to online and digital services. In Q3, we also saw strength in Google Cloud, Play and YouTube subscriptions.
This is the third quarter we are reporting earnings during the COVID-19 pandemic. Access to information has never been more important. This year, including this quarter showed how valuable Google's founding Product Search has been to people. And importantly, our products and investments are making a real difference as businesses work [indiscernible] and get back on their feet. Whether it's finding the latest information on COVID-19 cases in their area, which local businesses are open, or what online courses will help them prepare for new jobs, people continue to turn to Google search.
You can now find useful information about offerings like no contact delivery or curbside pickup for 2 million businesses on search and maps. And we have used Google's Duplex AI Technology to make calls to businesses and confirm things like temporary closures. This has enabled us to make 3 million updates to business information globally.
We know that people's expectations for instant perfect search results are high. That's why we continue to invest deeply in AI and other technologies to ensure the most helpful search experience possible. Two weeks ago, we announced a number of search improvements, including our biggest advancement in our spelling systems in over a decade. A new approach to identifying key moments and videos, and one of people's favorites hum to search which will identify a song noticed based on the humming.
We also announced that bird a huge breakthrough in natural language understanding that we introduced last year. Now we improve results for almost every English search query. We are also investing in improving the shopping experience in search to help people find the best products and prices available from a wide range of merchants. We recently added easy to see price comparisons to help consumers know if they're getting a good deal.
We've also improved our features like price tracking, so people can request an alert if there is a discount on a product they are following. These investments are also benefiting merchants and advertisers and helping them recover.
As of today, merchants can list products for free on our shopping tab in 48 countries around the world. For advertisers, we recently announced a new insights page in Google ads to help businesses better understand consumer trends and track current search demand for products for services.
We're also investing to create improved search experiences that provide additional value to news publishers. We recently committed $1 billion in investments that include licensing content from national, regional and local news publishers for Google News showcase a new product that features the editorial curation of award winning newsrooms. We've signed partnerships with nearly 200 publications around the world more to come. We know our success and surge is not guaranteed. We are proud that people choose Google search, not because they have to, but because it's helpful.
We remain committed to investing to build the most helpful, most trusted search experience. Just we have for the last 22 years. On that note regarding the DOJs lawsuit, we believe that our products are creating significant consumer benefits and will confidently make our case. Our company's focus remains on continuing our work to build a search product that people love and value.
Moving on to other parts of our business this quarter. In hardware, we highlighted some great new products available for the holidays. Our new pixel phones bring together the very best of Google's hardware, software and AI at an affordable price with new camera and assistant features. And our latest Chromecast now comes with Google TV, which brings together movie shows and live TV from across apps and subscriptions and organizes them for you. We are pleased with the positive reviews. We have a terrific product roadmap ahead.
Onto YouTube, people come to YouTube for entertainment, information and opportunities to learn something new. As a sign of the times, views for guided meditation videos are up 40% since mid March, while DIY face mask tutorials have been viewed over 1 billion times. YouTube subscriptions also continue to grow. YouTube now has over 30 million music and premium paid subscribers, and over 35 million including those on free trials. YouTube TV now has more than 3 million paid subscribers.
Next, cloud, three trends are driving the continued momentum of cloud business. First, as the shift to digital accelerates, Google Cloud continues to provide a foundation for data processing and analytics. One of the fastest growing segments of the market. BigQuery, which provides real time and predictive analytics is winning retailers like Best Buy, helping them create better experiences for shoppers. Customers value are differentiated AI ML based industry specific solutions. This is leading to significant events with brands like Unilever, Anvil, and Reckitt Benckiser.
Additionally, we are working with government agencies like the U.S. Navy to modernize maintenance operations for vessels and facilities. We are also partnering with the defense innovation unit part of the U.S. Department of Defense to help military doctors with cancer detection research. And recently, we signed an enterprise agreement with the U.S. Department of Energy to help scale research efforts and innovate across national labs and field sites.
Second, customers are increasingly moving to the cloud to drive efficiencies and lower IT costs. A strength in multi cloud is an advantage here. This is helping us when large data center and IT transformation deals like Nokia, which recently announced its migrating and modernizing approximately 30 data centers across 12 countries onto Google Cloud.
And third, the future of work is creating a more collaborative world. Customers are looking to support hybrid work environments, we're seeing significant growth in demand. Earlier this month, we announced Google workspace which brings together all of our communication and collaboration apps and ensures they work better together. This is helping organizations like the State of West Virginia and shipping company Ocean Network Express improve collaboration productivity for their employees. Google workspace continues to grow. For example, Google Meet saw peak in Q3 of 235 million daily meeting participants, and more than 7.5 billion daily video call minutes.
Finally, in our other bets, Lemo announced its fully autonomous ride hailing service in suburban Phoenix will open to the public, making it the only company to offer a fully autonomous service for riders. Lemo also entered into a strategic global partnership with Daimler Trucks to enable fully autonomous trucking.
Before I close, I want to reiterate our four key areas of focus, which you've heard me talk about all year. First, creating the most helpful product for everyone. Our investments in search, maps and shopping that I discussed earlier, as well as YouTube are prime examples.
Second, providing the most trusted experiences for our users. We continue to work hard to keep users safe and put them in control of their information. Every day Gmail blocks more than hundred million phishing attempts. And Google Play protect scams over hundred billion apps for malware and other issues.
Third, executing at scale productively, securely and collaboratively, and finally creating sustainable value, which means creating financially viable and self sustaining products.
Before I hand over to Ruth, one important update. Starting with the results for the fourth quarter of 2020. We'll break out Google Cloud as a separate reporting segment. I'm working with Ruth and Thomas Kurian to make investment decisions to drive progress here. As we have told you on these calls, given the progress, we are making an opportunity for Google Cloud in this growing global market. We continue to invest aggressively to build our go-to-market capabilities, execute against our product roadmap and extend the global footprint of our infrastructure.
But the segmentation, you will additionally see information about the scale of our investments, which should help you gauge the progress we are making on the multiyear path ahead to create sustainable value. Thanks to all the Googlers around the world for everything you're doing to help our users and partners. I hope everyone stay safe. And let me reiterate my gratitude to essential workers, health care providers, first responders, teachers and scientists everywhere.
With that I’ll now turn it over to Ruth. Thank you, Sundar. We are very pleased by our results in the third quarter, which reflect both broad based increases in advertiser spending in search and YouTube, as well as ongoing strength in our non-advertising revenue lines, in particular Google Cloud and Play. Starting with consolidated Alphabet results, our total revenues in the quarter were $46.2 billion, up 14% year-on-year and up 15% in constant currency.
Our total cost of revenues was $21.1 billion up 20% year-on-year, primarily driven by other cost of revenues, which was $13 billion and up 29% year-over-year. The biggest factors here again this quarter were costs associated with our data centers and other operations including depreciation, and then content acquisition costs primarily driven by costs for YouTube's advertising supported content, followed by cost per subscription service content.
Operating expenses were $13.8 billion up 1% year-on-year, reflecting both the impact of actions taken earlier in the year as a result of COVID as well as lapping a $554 million legal settlement in the third quarter of 2019. In terms of the three component parts of [OPEC], first, the deceleration in R&D growth was due primarily to slower headcount.
Second, the year-on-year decline in sales and marketing expenses, reflects the planned reduction in advertising and promotional spend that we implemented towards the end of the first quarter. Third, G&A growth reflects the lapping of the settlement. All three categories benefited from lower G&A expenses due to COVID.
Headcount was up 4,623 from the second quarter. Again, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizeable headcount increases or again in Google Cloud for both technical and sales roles.
Operating Income was $11.2 billion up 22% year-over-year, and our operating margin in the quarter was 24%. Other income and expense was $2.1 billion, which primarily reflects unrealized gains in the value of investments in equity securities.
Net income was $11.2 billion, operating cash flow was $17 billion, with free cash flow of $11.6 billion in the quarter, and $34 billion and the trailing 12 months. We ended the third quarter with $133 billion in cash and marketable securities.
Let me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with our Google segment, total Google revenues were $46 billion up 14% year-over-year, Google search and other advertising revenues were $26.3 billion in the quarter, up 6% year-over-year, as advertisers spend began to pick up in August. YouTube advertising revenues were $5 billion up 32% year-on-year, driven by ongoing substantial growth in direct response, followed by a rebound in brand advertising from increased spending by advertisers. Network advertising revenues were $5.7 billion up 9% year-on-year.
Turning to Google Cloud, including GCP and Google workspace, which was previously known as G-Suite. Revenues were $3.4 billion for the third quarter, up 45% year-over-year. GCP maintained the very strong level of revenue growth it's delivered in the second quarter, and its revenue growth rate was again meaningfully above cloud overall. Growth in Google workspace revenues was driven by seat growth followed by growth in average revenue per seat
Other revenues were $5.5 billion up 35% year-over-year, primarily driven by growth in Play and YouTube non-advertising revenues. Within play app revenues in the third quarter benefited primarily from an increased in the number of active buyers as well as increased spend per buyer. Within YouTube's subscription revenues, we continued to benefit from subscriber growth across its various offerings.
Google operating income was $12.6 billion, up 17% versus last year and the operating margin was 27%. As to our other bets revenues in the third quarter were $178 million. The operating loss was $1.1 billion.
Let me end with our outlook. Regarding revenues, in the third quarter, we benefited from a broad based improvement in advertiser spend across all geographies, and nearly all verticals. This is reflected in both search results, as well as the rebound in brand advertising spent on YouTube. While we're pleased with our performance in the third quarter, there's obviously uncertainty in the external environment.
In terms of Google Cloud, we're pleased with the consistent strong revenue growth that you saw again this quarter, reflecting the extraordinary secular trend underway. And with respect to other revenues, the primary driver of growth was Play where revenue growth reflected elevated engagement during the pandemic on top of strong underlying growth. There are signs that user behavior is beginning to return to normalize levels.
Moving on to profitability. We are pleased with the improvement in profitability versus the prior quarter, reflecting both the revenue performance versus Q2, as well as the tactical adjustments we made to slow down certain categories of spend in response to COVID. In particular, the deceleration in headcount growth this quarter, reflects the actions we took at the outset of the pandemic, to focus hiring on our highest priority areas like Google Cloud. Excluding the impact of closing the pending Fitbit acquisition, we expect a moderate further deceleration in the pace of headcount growth in the fourth quarter. We also saw the impact of steps we took to slow down some categories of marketing spend.
In the third quarter, sales and marketing expenses declined year-on-year, primarily due to a plan to slow down in ads and promo. We expect a more moderated year-on-year decline in sales and marketing in the fourth quarter, as we increased spend sequentially to support product launches and the holiday season.
Turning to CapEx, once again, this quarter, we had a year-on-year decline in investments primarily due to a reduced pace of real estate acquisitions, which we implemented at the outset of the pandemic. Servers continued to be the largest driver of investment in the third quarter followed by data centers. Our CapEx outlook for the full year has not changed as we continue to expect a modest decrease in 2020 compared with last year.
Looking ahead, we remained focused on making the right investments to support growth. As Sundar said in his opening comments, we continue to invest where we see the potential to create long-term sustainable financial value, including investing aggressively to support growth in cloud. In addition, given the acceleration in digital transformation, we are focused on ensuring that we remain well positioned to deliver for users and advertisers in this evolving environment.
Thank you, Sundar and I will now take your questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your line is now open. Question maybe I could ask to Sundar on the high level. You called out some of the innovation you're aiming for over the medium to long-term with respect to search, can you take a step back and maybe give us your sense of how search is going to evolve from a product it is today where there's a lot of input by the user to sort of the push dynamic with the Discover feed and Discover ads that could drive both engagement and monetization across your platform? And the second part of the question was, it seems like you're taking a little bit of a different tactic with your hardware strategy this year, they're a little bit less of it. And it was more on the mid to low render the price range of hardware, how does hardware and broadly time the assistant into the hardware strategy fit broadly similar into your view for where search is going to the medium to long-term? Thanks so much. Thanks, Eric. Good questions. On search, you're right, today, particularly with mobile and ambient computing, that is, you having access to computing across other form factors. I think information both you go looking for it and there are times, it's important that you have relevant information at your fingertips. So I do think about it as a holistic user journey.
And obviously, in search will continue to evolve Discover has been very good in terms of Discover and YouTube both play a role in making sure people are getting relevant information. And, I think for us, it's important holistically, we're meeting users information needs and out of which, the monetization opportunity also works as well. So long -- this is why, be it, Discover or be it how we pick up on YouTube, all of that matters for us.
On your second question on our hardware, I'm excited about the, we are doing some deeper investments in hardware, which, which are some of it take students for years to come together. And so, excited at the terrific roadmap ahead. I think we have definitely shown that Pixel 4a Pixel 5, clear value proposition, and we'll build on that.
You know our portfolio, you know, we are thoughtfully thinking about what are the important form factors, which matters and we do think about it with the view of fair search and assistant will be important as well. So in many ways, hardware is there to strategically benefit both how we guide the Android ecosystem. How do we make sure information is right there at user's fingertips.
And so those are both strategic views we take into it as well, but I'm excited about the roadmap ahead and next year you would see as lean more into some of our deeper investments will come into play there. Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Thanks for taking the question. Ruth, we appreciate the incremental color on 3Q and 4Q expenses, which was hoping that you could help us understand the cost structure a little bit more, kind of as we're coming out of this and just know whether you're anticipating any more notable changes, just coming out of the pandemic kind of around the sustainability of the margin improvements that you saw in this quarter. Thanks. Thanks for that, Doug. So as I said, as a result of COVID, we did make tactical adjustments to slow the pace of spent in certain categories. And that, that started late in the first quarter. And in part, that's what you see here, plus the impact from the improvements in revenue performance. And we do remain focused on optimizing efficiency where we can, we've said that on many prior calls, but as we've also discussed with you on prior calls, as both Sundar and I noted, today, we are committed to making the right investments to support long-term profitable growth.
And I think what's exciting in this environment, there appears to be an acceleration in digital transformation that underscores the importance of the products and services that we provide, and the longer term opportunities. So we will continue to invest to best position us for the long-term opportunity. An obvious example is cloud, we do intend to maintain a high level of investment, given the opportunity we see that includes the ongoing increases in our go-to-market organization, our engineering organization, as well as the investments to support the necessary CapEx. So hopefully that gives you a bit more color there. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Great, thank you very much for taking the question. Sundar, I have a question for you. Just Thomas has been the Head of Google Cloud now for around two years, if I remember correctly, I'm just wondering, what do you see as the biggest changes he's put into place that has allowed the business to start gaining what appears to be materially more share? And as you look ahead to 2021, and what's going on with digital transformation, what would you say is top strategic priorities would be? Thank you. Thanks, Heather. A couple things stand out for me, I think it's been a very consistent focus strategy. So the focus on the five major geographies, the four customer segments in the six priority industries, healthcare, retail, financial services, media, entertainment, manufacturing and public sector, that focus and going deeper, and scaling our go-to-market, both in terms of our people, our partner, partners setting, that's been key.
The second thing I would say is some of the key differentiators are playing out particularly as we have taken them deeper as unique industry solutions. So going deeper and having solutions and in some of those cases where we are now pricing based on value. I think that kind of deeper play, something I'm very excited about, definitely have strengthen just based on our underlying technology. So we do have differentiation in areas like data analytics, AI, et cetera.
So that's been, that's been huge as well. But I'm pleased with the execution obviously, in this there is a time lag between when you hire the sales and when we train and when you enable them to be more productive. And that's the investment Ruth has been talking about. And I can see it ramping, and they can see the results come into play. So credit towards that focus and execution and so looking forward to the next [phase]. Great. Thank you very much. Thanks for converging. And Best wishes. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Thanks for taking my question. Sundar, I wanted to ask one about ecommerce specifically, you know, it seems to become increasingly competitive within the ecommerce funnel. So maybe talk to us about one, what types of consumer behavior changes? Are you seeing within ecommerce search on the platform? And then, in your mind, what are the key priorities of investment, you need to really execute on to ensure you stay at the top of the funnel within ecommerce? Thanks. I think thanks that standard, first of all, I'm excited that, the set of announcements and progress we've had in the last few months. And obviously, we're really focused on the user experience, and we want to make sure, as a consumer you vide, comprehensive, high quality, inventory and offerings and experience on the platform, our free shopping listings, which we launched in the U.S. is now available in 48 countries around the world.
Additionally, we eliminated commission fees. So for the buy on Google Checkout option, opened the platform up to, you know, PayPal Shopify for integration as well. So that gives rise to comprehensiveness. And we are focused on quality there. In terms of the funnel and behavior, to me, what's interesting is, obviously, search captures the intent of the moment and the breadth of search, I think has been, has been a real asset.
And, you know, both you -- as users adapt, advertisers adapt to so you can see that see the dynamic play in real time. But you do see, I would say YouTube is an important platform for ecommerce as well. I can see advertisers in the YouTube of the mid funnel level, even currently, if that's not the intent at that moment, investor, create demand, create interest, and so on. So, for us EC commerce working across the platform, and I think that's an opportunity and then making sure the rest of the experience is good for users is something we are deeply focused on. Thanks Sundar. Thank you. And our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Good afternoon. Ruth, you called brand advertisers coming back to YouTube, I'm just curious if you could give us a sense of where you're seeing that strength in kind of where you at relative to pre covered levels, with, with those advertisers? So overall, we're pleased at the degree to which advertisers really have reactivated their budgets, this in the third quarter, they reacting in part two, I think, evidence that consumers are showing strong demand across nearly all verticals, it's everything from home and garden to computer to work from home. And so very helpful there. And then YouTube's strong watch time growth enables advertisers to reach audience that they can't reach on TV, as we've often talked about. And so they're increasingly looking to ask to help them reach people who are going to YouTube to learn new topics and engage with fresh entertaining content, great, great, unique content. So it's, it's been an opportunity, we're pleased to senior performance in the third quarter. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Justin post from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Great, thank you so much, maybe one for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar, thanks for the update on the DOJ. As you think about all the regulators all over the world, is there. Is there any hope of coming to a middle ground here? How are you thinking about how far apart you guys are in different regions? And then maybe for Ruth, on the YouTube opportunity, if you assume about 2 billion users, you're on a run rate of maybe $10 per user. I just wondering how you how you're thinking about the monetization? Are you still very early and if you can give us any help on what the margins might look like? Thank you. Ruth, you want to go ahead -- So look, in terms of YouTube, as I said, we are pleased with the ongoing momentum that you see in the revenue line, I think, as we've talked to you about quite frequently, in our ad supported business within YouTube, we do pay out a majority of revenues to all of our content creators, we pay all of the infrastructure and networking costs that's you know, for storing for serving video or otherwise for running YouTube. And that includes marketing, supporting content creators, there's quite a bit more that we think is invaluable for creators in the overall ecosystem to make sure we're creating not only great experiences for users and creators, but really the right overall ecosystem.
And we've talked about that in the context of how we invest, protect, content -- protect the content, that people are seeing content, moderation investments we view as really an invaluable part of what we're doing and critically important. So we're continuing to support that do view, the experience that both creators and users have is just really differentiated as a result. And then on the subscription side, we're continuing to build it out, as Sundar noted in his opening comments, both YouTube Music premium and YouTube TV, do you have higher content acquisition costs as a percentage of revenues than YouTube ads, and we are early there continuing to build out that subscriber base. And Justin, on the regulatory front, scrutiny is not new for us. And in some ways, it's now sector wide, and not surprisingly, so. We will engage constructively where possible. And as we have shown through some of the past cases, when there is -- we'll be confident about the benefits we bring to our users, we'll make our case where there is feedback or rulings, we'll be flexible and adapt and so we are building that into it.
I think while there's a lot on the legislative and regulatory front, as some of this gets resolved, it also creates certainty, and in some cases, clarity and opportunities as well. And so, and so that's the framework with which we approach it. And we'll take a long-term view towards it. And but -- at the end of the day, what's in our control is our ability to relentlessly focus on users and build great products. And that's where most of our energy will go into. Yes, thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC. Your line is now open. Thanks two questions, please. It sounds like you're going to provide more disclosure on Google Cloud in the fourth quarter, will that also be on the profitability of Google Cloud or could you address the question of whether Google Cloud has reached a point of scale where it's no longer dilutive to overall margins, and then briefly, two new revenue opportunities, or growing revenue opportunities over the year Google Maps and the Discover tab, any update or any new data points that suggest a monetization opportunity with those two assets? Thank you. So thanks for that Mark. And when we break out Cloud, and we will be also reporting that is the fourth quarter results, but we'll be providing full year results for 2018 ‘19 and ‘20. We'll be providing not just the revenue disaggregation data that we expanded earlier this year, but we will be adding operating income for each of our segments, which we think is the most relevant data. And the point, that both Sundar and I have underscored is that we are investing aggressively in cloud given the opportunity that we see. And frankly, the fact that we were later relative to peers were encouraged -- very encouraged by the pace of customer wins, and the very strong revenue growth in both GCP and workspace. But we do intend to maintain a high level of investment to best position ourselves. And I kind of went through some of those items that the go-to-market team, the engineering team and CapEx. And so we describe this as a multiyear path, because we do believe we're still early in this journey. On a Maps and Discover, et cetera, again, I think I spoke a little bit earlier about thinking through more holistically an example where we -- I think worked well as you know, as developers, we're looking to promote apps that are universal app campaigns, you could really reach across and it's a good model to think about recently, for example, to serve small and medium businesses, we expanded smart campaigns to 150 countries and they're a small business owner, you can set up your first campaign, create your first ad in 15 minutes from the from your mobile device. So for me thinking about these surfaces, as you know, we'll do the hard work to make sure the most relevant information gets and thinking about it more holistically. And I think gives us a chance to also engage users in the way they want us to, sometimes when they come looking for it, and sometimes when they proactively want information given to them. And so that's the overall view and I think the opportunity is very exciting ahead. Okay, thank you very much. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets Your line is now open. Great. Thanks, and good afternoon, everyone. Sundar, in your response to the DOJs lawsuit [indiscernible] compared to your search partnerships to how [indiscernible] brand might pay a supermarket to be at the end of the row or at high level. We've also heard Philip Schindler talk about your addressable market being potentially twice as large as commonly viewed and maybe that includes things like those payments inside supermarkets. So my question is two parts. Firstly, is it fair to tie those two types of comments together and assume that they're related to each other? And then second, could you maybe talk about how that might matter to your bigger picture thinking about the advertising and ecommerce opportunity for Google? And in particular, the competitive environment you face? Yes, Dan at a high level stepping back from it all? We are -- our mission is to provide information, so the competitive environment we faces, particularly with mobile and user looking for information, there's – so many choices they have. And so the question is, you know, making should Google is a relevant way by which they get that information. And, you know, you can imagine when people are looking to buy products, or the competitors that exist, travel, booking hotels or any category you take and so for us that's why I talk about holistically competing and making sure we can provide relevant information is both competition we face for mindshare, and that's the opportunity we have ahead.
In terms of specifics of the DOJ case and stuff and confident, you know, we have approached everything, both with the view of making sure we create the best user experience and be -- we really want, we've always built Google for everyone. So we want it to be available on all platforms and be convenient for users to access our services and as part of that partner with other companies in doing so. And so look forward to making our case there. But it's definitely early days. And we're still reviewing an understanding it all. And I'm sure we'll update more as time goes by. Okay, thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian from Baird. Your line is now open. Thanks, I have a couple here as well. Maybe just a follow up on the shopping question. Specifically on YouTube, if you could expand on the role that shopping and shopping ads are now playing in the growth strategy there. And on Google workspace, it seemed like this is an unique opportunity, with work from home to really drive adoption and monetization of the services, including meet as well as bundling with cloud services, so I wonder if you could provide little more detail on the levels of usage and engagement you're seeing with those applications? And how you plan to monetize those going forward. Thank you. Great, on shopping and YouTube, definitely say, we are on the earlier part of the journey. But we have seen the strength in YouTube for direct response and on a few other categories. And I think the experiences we see there, I think can directly carryover to commerce. And as we build out the experience, so I see that as an opportunity. I earlier also mentioned about what searches currently capturing the intent at that given time, YouTube, advertisers can take a longer term view create brand awareness, create interest, and so on.
So that also offers, opportunity. So we today in many, many categories have creators with very compelling content. And I've always felt things work well if you match user interest and it's very relevant to users. And so I think commerce, there is a lot of commercial activity on YouTube organically. And so I see it as a long-term opportunity.
On Google workspace, I'm very excited that, we both have strong growth, I mentioned meet metrics earlier, that we saw a peak of 235 million daily meeting participants in Q3 and more than 7.5 billion daily video call minutes. Definitely significant growth and meet as well as our other products like docs drive and chat. But Google workspace also now creates the unified experience and I think we are definitely seeing a lot of interest.
And demand there, I do think COVID is really accelerating the future of work. And many of the trends there are, you know, will last through time, and I think gives all of us a chance to reimagine this, what would we imagined? What does collaboration and productivity at scale including people working remotely looks like. And we plan to be at the forefront of that, and some excited for the opportunity there. Great, thank you. Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Ross Sandler from Barclays. Your line is now open. Hi, just two questions. If we look at search, your growth rates in January and February compared to today, so pre-COVID versus today, I guess how many categories are above the [indiscernible] have growth rate? Is travel the only large category at this stage that's running below your pre-COVID growth rates in search? And then the second question is on the topic of the Apple search agreement, so as you guys said in your blog post, based on other agreements, where you seeing things change hands, you didn't really lose a lot of query volume after the change. So what do you think the recapture rate of queries on the so for the toolbar would be if that deal were to change hands? Is this really a COVID situation or is it something that we should be able to manage through? Thanks a lot. So in terms of your first question, as we've often said, we have a very diverse business globally, and that's across sectors, customer size, geographies. And with respect to sectors, we saw broad based improvement across virtually all basically [mirrors] what you see in the broader economy, and we don't break out more than that, but it was, quite broad based. In terms of your, second question, Sundar, do you want to take that? On search, as I said, you know, for a long time, we work hard to make sure users can conveniently access us. Most of our partners choose us, because they are the best search provider users find us having the highest search quality. And so there's organic demand for it. And we believe in investing in our experience across all our platforms. And so we are definitely committed to making sure we can serve our users everywhere and we are really focused on it. Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any closing remarks. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We know you all have a busy evening. We look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter 2020 call. Thank you and have a good evening. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler and Ruth Porat. Now I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations and financial performance, including the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on those areas, may be considered forward-looking. And such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. Additional information will also be set forth in our upcoming Form 10-K filing for the year ended December 31, 2020.
During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor.
And now I'll turn the call over to Sundar. Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. 2020 was a year unlike any other. We are proud that people continue to choose Google's products to stay informed, connected and comforted during uncertain times. Being helpful to people in moments big and small is the foundation of everything we do.
The past year also accelerated the shift to cloud and adoption of online services. This has profound implications for all companies and consumers, and we are pleased that so many trust us to help them make this transition. In particular, Google's products and support have been a lifeline for millions of small and medium businesses hit hard by the pandemic.
Today, I'll review some of the important work we have done this quarter across Google and Alphabet with a particular focus on our growing cloud business, which we are breaking out as a separate segment for the first time. Then I'll welcome to the call Google's Chief Business Officer, Philipp Schindler, who many of you know from investor conferences and events. Philipp will speak about partnerships, business and advertising trends in the Google Services segment. We have heard that you appreciate more texture and detail there. Then Ruth will go through the quarter in more detail.
First, some highlights at Google. Since the pandemic began, our teams have built new features and products to help people and businesses. Now we are helping with the complex challenge of getting vaccines to billions of people around the world. Vaccination locations have started to roll out in Google Search and Maps. Google Cloud's Intelligent Vaccine Impact platform is helping authorities improve vaccine distribution and forecasting. We are providing substantial new ad grants to the CDC, the World Health Organization and others to promote vaccine education. We're also making direct grants to organizations addressing racial and geographic disparities in vaccination access, plus opening up Google's facilities as vaccination clinics as needed.
Elsewhere, in Maps, we added a new community feed in the Explore tab, and now you can track takeout and delivery orders when you book or order from Google Maps. At YouTube, we are building products to help creators benefit from 2 important trends: live video and short-form video. More than 0.5 million channels livestreamed on YouTube for the first time in 2020, from artists performing in their living rooms to churches moving their services online. And videos in our new Shorts player are receiving 3.5 billion daily views. We are looking forward to expanding Shorts to more countries this year.
Philipp will dive into the work to support online commerce and our partners, but I want to call out our News Showcase product. It's a $1 billion investment in partnerships with news publishers, and I'm really excited about our progress here. We have now signed agreements with nearly 450 publications, the majority of which are local and regional, across a dozen countries including France, Germany, U.K. and Brazil. And last month, we announced a new global deal with Reuters as well as an agreement with one of the major French publishing associations to open access to News Showcase. We want to do more partnerships in more countries, and we'll have more to announce in the weeks to come.
Among other highlights, we also launched our reimagined Google Pay app, making it easier to organize finances and save money. It's now used by over 150 million people in 30 countries. In hardware, we recently closed our acquisition of Fitbit, which will improve our product pipeline and help make health and wellness accessible to more people. To all the Fitbit employees, welcome to Google. We have a great portfolio of products, and I look forward to sharing more about our product plans.
Now a closer look at Google Cloud. I'm very pleased with the progress here. And as Ruth will mention, we'll continue making disciplined investments to scale the business and improve profitability. Google Cloud delivered revenue growth of 47% year-over-year, with GCP growth remaining meaningfully above the growth rate for Cloud overall. In addition, our backlog grew to nearly $30 billion, up from $19 billion in Q3, nearly all attributable to Cloud. We continue to invest strongly in the business given the momentum we are seeing.
These investments in our go-to-market organization have helped us win larger deals including several billion-dollar deals in 2020. Deals over $250 million more than tripled in the same period. We're also seeing strong growth through our broad network of partners, with our channel partner ecosystem growing more than 5x, and indirect channel revenue, more than doubling in the past 2 years. Our industry-leading customer satisfaction, as identified in a recent report from IDC, is helping us drive significant expansion and net revenue retention with existing customers.
Our products are mature and highly differentiated in many segments. In infrastructure cloud, our leadership in multi-cloud and cybersecurity helped us win large data center and IT transformation deals with customers like Highmark Health and Vodafone as well as cloud-native leaders, including Wayfair and Etsy. Our leading data and analytics cloud provides new customers such as Kyoto University Graduate School of medicine and health care and MercadoLibre in retail with the ability to analyze any data in real time across any cloud. Our industry solutions based on our AI/ML expertise have helped us win customers like Optus in communications and Otto Group in retail.
I'm also particularly excited to see us winning large transformations by bringing the entire breadth of Google's technology to customers. Yesterday, we announced our multiyear partnership with Ford, which is using Google Cloud, Android and other Google apps and services to transform their business. Google Workspace, the industry's only cloud-native communication and collaboration solution, is helping companies meet their evolving hybrid workplace needs. Workspace is driving innovation at many of the fastest growing companies. Additionally, this quarter, we expanded our partnership with SAP. They'll extend their usage of Google Cloud for their cloud solutions, including SAP Business Technology Platform, to provide the best experience for our joint customers.
Across the Alphabet portfolio, our investments in AI continue to drive progress. For example, DeepMind's AI part protein-folding breakthrough will enable researchers to tackle new and difficult problems, from fighting diseases to environmental sustainability. Google has partnership with Mayo Clinic in developing AI systems that can help plan radiotherapy treatments. Waymo is now providing hundreds of fully autonomous rides per week and recently partnered with Daimler trucks to develop fully autonomous trucks.
To wrap up, last year I talked about our 4 big themes of helpfulness, trust, execution and sustainable value. These will continue to guide our strategic focus across the company in 2021 and beyond as we continue to advance our core information mission in products like Search, Maps and YouTube; keep people's information safe and secure; drive substantial advancements in AI over the next 3 years; and ensure we are the most effective place to work beyond COVID, all supported by sustainable long-term businesses.
I want to thank our teams across Google and Alphabet for all of their work this quarter and throughout all of 2020. 2021 gives us another chance to be helpful to people, businesses and communities. While there's hard work ahead, I'm profoundly optimistic about what we'll accomplish together.
With that, I'll turn it over to Philipp. Thanks, Sundar, and good afternoon, everyone. It's great to be joining you today. We're pleased with Google Services revenue of $52.9 billion in the fourth quarter, which continued the significant rebound from the negative impact of COVID earlier in the year. Two trends drove the strong results across Search, YouTube and network advertising. Consumers continued to move more of their activity online, and advertisers responded to the shift in consumer behavior by reactivating spend that they had paused earlier in the crisis.
In the fourth quarter, retail was the largest contributor to the year-on-year growth of our ads business. Tech, media and entertainment and CPG were also strong contributors. The trajectory of search advertising over the past year demonstrates its responsiveness to consumer interest and needs and how marketers can quickly adjust their spending as circumstances change to focus on generating ROI for their businesses.
In YouTube, Direct Response had a substantial year-on-year growth throughout the entire year, including the fourth quarter. After a substantial pullback at the outset of the pandemic, brand spending began to recover in the third quarter. Marketers realized that even if there was a pullback in consumer demand in the short term, they needed to keep their brands in front of people to stay top of mind when spending pick back up. In the fourth quarter, we saw significant acceleration of brand spending on YouTube. Network revenues in the fourth quarter benefited from the same uplift in spend by advertisers, particularly in AdMob and Ad Manager. Google other revenues were driven by growth in YouTube's nonadvertising revenues, primarily from subscriptions as well as by Google Play revenue growth.
I now want to step back from the results of the quarter and quickly reflect on the generational shift to digital we've seen over the past year and what that means for our business. First, dramatic changes to consumer behavior have fundamentally changed the way companies are doing business across many industries and geographies. Lufthansa is a great example. Like many airlines, they needed more insight on where to fly, at what capacity and how often as travel started to open up last year. Over the summer, we built a product called Flight Demand Explorer, which gave real-time answers to these questions, helping them find demand and ramp up. Within 2 months, they tripled destination routes and got more than 80 planes back in the air, with many flights fully sold out within days.
We're putting real-time insights into the hands of businesses and other verticals. In fact, we just launched a new insights page to give our advertisers the latest on ever-changing search trends relevant to their business right inside of Google Ads. Petco is another great example as people adopted an unprecedented number of pets during shelter-in-place. It led to a spike in demand for pet supplies, and Petco saw their curbside pickup services go through the roof. So they accelerated delivery and pickup options using Search, Shopping and local inventory ads and were able to drive a 100% increase in their e-commerce business. And this is important. Multi-touch points like curbside pickup and pick up in-store are in high demand and here to stay. We've seen huge year-on-year jumps in searches for available near me and curbside pickup. Retailers offering multi-touch are benefiting from this trend, and this offering sits squarely in our core capabilities with Maps and Search.
Let me tell you about L'Oréal. They did a great job adapting to changes in shopping behavior by making a sharp pivot to e-commerce and to TrueView. By making existing video creatives more timely and actionable, their Kiehl's U.S. brand drove record visits to their site from YouTube, 4x more per dollar. They're also partnering with us to bring AR experience for their cosmetics across Google Services, including YouTube and Search. I could go on and on. Companies are rapidly adopting.
Next, I'd like to talk about how we're evolving our commerce strategy. We've taken significant steps to accelerate an open ecosystem for online retail that benefits businesses of all sizes, from large online household names to your neighborhood store just around the corner. We've long said that we want to make Google the best place for users to start their shopping journeys, regardless of where those journeys end.
In the fourth quarter, the year-over-year growth rates in retail searches was more than 3x the rate we had seen in the same period last year driven in part by COVID. We also want to make Google the best place for merchants to connect with users, regardless of whether the transaction happens on our platform or theirs. Over the last 12 months, we grew our merchant community over 80%, with significant growth in small and medium-sized businesses. All of these merchants and their inventory will show up across Google, including Search, Image Search and YouTube.
I want to close by talking about something that has been a principle of Google since our founding. We've always believed that the future of Google and the future of our partners are fundamentally linked. In fact, we built our business on revenue share models that support a broad range of partners, including large and small online publishers, individual YouTube creators broadcasting from their homes and global music labels as well as Google Play developers of all sizes. We only succeed when our customers and partners succeed. One number, I think, is worthwhile highlighting in this context. Over the past 3 years, we paid out nearly $140 billion to our partners, from Google Play developers and publisher partners using our advertising services to YouTube creators, artists and media organizations around the world.
Our performance is only possible because of our customers and partners. I want to thank them for their partnership, collaboration and feedback. I also want to thank our product, partnership, sales and many support teams for their tremendous work, innovating to help our users, customers and partners succeed, especially through these difficult times.
I'll now hand off the call to Ruth. Thank you, Philipp. We are very pleased with our exceptional fourth quarter performance after an unprecedented year. For 2020, total Alphabet revenues were $183 billion, up 13% year-on-year or up 14% in constant currency. With our new segment disclosures this quarter, I'll start with quarterly results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook. My focus will be on year-on-year comparisons for the fourth quarter, unless I state otherwise.
For the fourth quarter, our consolidated revenues were $56.9 billion, up 23%, which reflect broad-based increases in advertiser spending in Search and YouTube within Google Services as well as ongoing strength in Google Cloud. Our total cost of revenues was $26.1 billion, up 24%, primarily driven by other cost of revenues, which was $15.6 billion and up 25%. The biggest factors here were: first, content acquisition costs, primarily driven by costs for YouTube's advertising-supported content, followed by costs for subscription content; and second, costs associated with data centers and other operations, including depreciation.
Operating expenses were $15.2 billion, down 4%. The year-on-year decline reflects the lapping of valuation-based compensation charges in certain Other Bets in the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily in R&D, as well as the impact of actions taken earlier in the year as a result of COVID. Each of the 3 components of OpEx also reflects our decision to slow head count growth beginning late in the first quarter. Head count was up 3,180 from the third quarter. Again, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers with continued aggressive investment in cloud for both technical and sales roles.
Operating income was $15.7 billion, up 69%, and our operating margin in the quarter was 28%. Other income and expense was $3 billion, which primarily reflects unrealized gains in the value of investments in equity securities. Net income was $15.2 billion. Operating cash flow was $22.7 billion, with free cash flow of $17.2 billion in the quarter and $43 billion for the full year 2020. We ended the fourth quarter with $137 billion in cash and marketable securities.
Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with our Google Services segment. Total Google Services revenues were $52.9 billion, up 22%. Each component of our advertising revenues reflects the return of advertiser spend in response to the continued movement of consumer activity online that Philipp spoke about, including Google Search and other advertising revenues of $31.9 billion in the quarter, up 17%; YouTube advertising revenues of $6.9 billion, up 46%, driven by a rebound not only in brand advertising but also ongoing strength in direct response; network advertising revenues of $7.4 billion, up 23%.
Other revenues were $6.7 billion, up 27%, primarily driven by growth in YouTube nonadvertising and Play revenues. Within Play, app revenues in the fourth quarter continued to benefit from elevated levels of engagement, reflecting increases in active buyers and spend per buyer due to COVID. However, we did experience a deceleration in growth from the levels we saw in the third quarter. Google Services operating income was $19.1 billion, up 41%, and the operating margin was 36%.
Turning to the Google Cloud segment, including GCP and Google Workspace. Revenues were $3.8 billion for the fourth quarter, up 47%. GCP's revenue growth rate was again meaningfully above Cloud overall. Strong growth in Google Workspace revenues was driven by growth in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had an operating loss of $1.2 billion, essentially flat versus last year.
As to our Other Bets, for the full year 2020, revenues were $657 million, primarily generated by Fiber and Verily, and reflect that most of our Other Bets are pre-revenue. The operating loss was $4.5 billion for the full year 2020 versus an operating loss of $4.8 billion in 2019.
Let me end with our outlook for each segment and our investments more broadly. For Google Services, we're encouraged by the increase in consumer online activity and the return of advertiser spend as reflected in our Q4 results. Looking forward to 2021, year-over-year quarterly comparisons will be affected meaningfully by the impact of COVID last year with easier comps in the first half, especially in Q2, and then lapping stronger performance in the second half. With respect to other revenues, with the closing of the Fitbit acquisition earlier this month, we will be reporting its revenues within Google Other.
In terms of investment levels within Google Services, late in the first quarter of 2020, as a result of COVID, we made what we described as tactical adjustments to slow the pace of spend in certain categories. Given the ongoing uncertainty in the external environment, we maintained the discipline through the rest of 2020. Looking forward, we do expect the pace of investment to increase to support the extraordinary opportunities we see given the usefulness of our products and services in this environment. The investment pace will ramp up over the course of the year.
As for Google Cloud, we've obviously been investing aggressively given the substantial market opportunity we see. Under Thomas Kurian's leadership, we further accelerated investment to strengthen the position of the business. For example, we are on track to meet our near-term goal of tripling the size of the Cloud Direct sales force and have greatly expanded the partner channel. We've also substantially improved our product offering while rationalizing our approach to focus on our 6 key industry verticals. And we've invested in expanding our network of locations for compute capacity to support Cloud, ending 2020 serving customers in 24 regions and 73 zones.
We're encouraged by the momentum in the growth of revenue and customer wins. We more than doubled revenues over the last 2 years from $5.8 billion in 2018 to $13.1 billion in 2020. Our backlog, which is nearly all attributable to Cloud, nearly tripled from 2019 to 2020. Although increases in backlog do not directly correlate to revenue trends, the growth in backlog demonstrates the success Google Cloud is having with large enterprises, which are signing meaningful long-term commitment agreements.
Looking forward, we will continue to focus on revenue growth driven by ongoing investment in products and the go-to-market organization. Cloud's operating loss reflects that we have meaningfully built out our organization ahead of revenues, as we've discussed in prior quarters, with respect to the substantial investments in our go-to-market organization as well as engineering and technical infrastructure. Operating loss and operating margin will benefit from increased scale over time. In addition, we are focused on delivering on efficiency efforts across the board to contribute incrementally to profitability over time.
Finally, as you can see from the historical data provided in the press release, Cloud's operating loss was higher in the first quarter relative to other quarters, and then the operating loss improves thereafter. We expect similar seasonality in 2021. In terms of Other Bets, we continue to invest with a focus on the long-term value creation opportunity.
On head count, we plan to reaccelerate the pace of hiring in Google Services, in line with our opportunities. Our head count growth will also reflect the addition of Fitbit and our ongoing transition of certain customer support roles from third-party vendors to Google's in-house operation centers. We also plan to continue to prioritize investment in both sales and technical roles for Google Cloud.
Turning to CapEx. At the consolidated level, the year-on-year results this quarter again reflect the slower pace throughout 2020 of investment in office facilities. Within technical infrastructure, servers continue to be the largest driver of investment in the fourth quarter, followed by data centers. Looking ahead, we expect a return to a more normalized pace of ground-up construction and fit-out of office facilities, which translates into a sizable increase in CapEx in 2021. Servers will continue to be the largest driver of spend on technical infrastructure.
Finally, a housekeeping point. As noted in our earnings press release, we have adjusted the estimated useful lives of servers and certain network equipment starting in 2021. We expect these changes will favorably impact our 2021 operating results by approximately $2.1 billion for assets as of year-end 2020.
We look forward to the year ahead. I hope everyone stays safe. Thank you. And now Sundar, Philipp and I will take your questions. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS. I hope everyone is safe and well on the team out there as well. Maybe I'll try first on Cloud. I don't know if it's better to Sundar or to Ruth, but can you just conceptually help us understand how to think about the opportunity you're going after versus Cloud and how it factors back into which you want to invest against the opportunity or, possibly, maybe even accelerate the opportunity by looking at inorganic paths to growing scale vis-à-vis competition in the space?
And then maybe for Philipp if I can. YouTube continues to evolve as a platform. There's now subscription offerings. You highlighted the strength you're seeing in DR. Could you talk a little bit about the path for monetization in the coming years and how we should think about the opportunity against a large-scale audience and engagement you see at YouTube broadly? On Cloud, obviously, we see how early customers are in the shift. We see the large TAM ahead and, definitely, the market dynamics. And our momentum, in the context of the market, is what is the framework which we are thinking about, the scale of investments and the pace of investments. Obviously, it's an area in which the longer you are in, the cohorts add up and so contributes more and the economies of scale starts working as well. But we are definitely investing ahead to making sure we are able to serve the customers globally across all the offerings they are interested in, and that's how we are thinking about it. Ruth, I'm not sure you want to add more. I think that's the main point, just given the sheer scale of the opportunity and our position, investing to really position ourselves well across industries and geographies. And the key elements of it, I tried to call out in the opening comments: investing in product, go to market, data centers. And you can see it in the results. I think you're going to continue to see us building there, and that's what we're talking about building ahead. We are keenly focused on delivering for both customers and shareholders and that, of course, includes an intense focus on the path to profitability. Yes. And on your question on YouTube, on the overall development and the subscription side, our Direct Response business on YouTube was practically nonexistent three years ago. And now it's one of our largest and fastest-growing ad offerings on YouTube. And with TrueView for action, we're actually making it easier for advertisers to unlock opportunities to reach audiences with video campaigns. And just to give you a few numbers, 60% of TrueView for action customers are new to YouTube. And we more than doubled the number of active advertisers using TrueView for action in the first 6 months of 2020.
And we're really tapping into the tremendous innate commercial behavior on the platform. 70% of YouTube viewers are saying they bought a brand as a result of seeing it on YouTube. I talked about L'oréal earlier. MasterClass is another great example. Online learning has become a huge opportunity, and they use TrueView for action to connect the right people to the right content and saw really big, like 140% increase in clicks to their sites, 70% increase in sign-ups to courses and so on.
YouTube continues, in our view, to be amazing for brand advertisers as well. Our brand business was hit hard in the early stages of the pandemic, rebounded in Q3 and into Q4. And it really helps advertisers reach younger audiences. They can reach anywhere. We now reach more 18- to 49-year-olds than all linear TV networks combined. Watch time is increasing. Advertiser effectiveness is getting better and better. And so this is a very nice development on the subscription strategy.
Maybe just briefly, music is an incredibly popular vertical on YouTube and, obviously, a key part of the overall experience. We found that users wanted a premium YouTube experience and we -- basically the ability to download songs and videos. YouTube Premium provides additional revenue streams, of course, for music labels and publishers as well. In 2019, YouTube paid the music industry over $3 billion. We have over 30 million music and premium paid subscribers. We are now operating over 95 countries, so members get a lot of extra benefits, yes. And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. Ruth and Sundar, I just wanted to follow up on Eric's question a bit. Anything else you can add just in terms of the significant inflection that you saw on Google Cloud backlog there? And I guess, in particular, curious what you're seeing in terms of benefit and success as you're leveraging Alphabet more broadly like in the Ford deal. And then how do you think about Google Cloud margins structurally kind of long-term relative to peers? Any color there would be helpful. Maybe I'll start with customers are looking for digital transformation. And depending on the sector they are in, they are definitely interested in a broader solution set across the breadth of what Google and Alphabet can bring. We see this in health care, our efforts in Google Health, work that's happening in Verily, all end up helping. Ford is a great example of, I'd say, thinking longer term not just for Cloud but Android auto-powering their vehicles. And so these are big transformations cutting across the company. And one of the areas where we are really executing is leveraging our global business operations that Philipp runs and partnering closely with Thomas' teams, and that's definitely brings in a lot of synergies here.
On your second question, on the broader stuff, the one thing I would say is -- I mentioned a part earlier, we get into these long-term deals. And so over time, as you add more cohorts, that contributes to the margin structure. It is -- the scale of the product offerings, the number of areas and the number of regions in the world, there's a much more significant investment. And so there is definitely a fixed cost structure associated with it, and we are also investing ahead. But as we scale up the business, we expect the trends to be favorable. And our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. You mentioned you accelerated -- saw accelerating brand spend in the quarter. And many investors are asking the sustainability and what you're seeing in that as you head into the beginning of this year. If you could just talk directionally in terms of how your clients are acting as they head out of the holiday season, that would be helpful. Sure. I'll take that. As we've each noted, the financial results really did reflect this increase in advertiser activity. And that was in part unlocking budgets that they had paused earlier in the year as well as really reflecting the increase in consumer online activity. The largest contributor, as Philipp mentioned, was retail, the largest contributor to the year-on-year growth of the ads business. But I would say tech, media and entertainment as well as CPG were also meaningful contributors. And for Search, we saw ongoing improvement in advertisers spend broadly.
For YouTube, Direct Response, as Philipp talked about, really did maintain a very high level of growth. And the acceleration in overall YouTube revenue growth reflects a pickup in brand advertising across all verticals on top of the ongoing strength that we saw in DR. And then in network, also same point, it's this pickup in advertiser spend, as Philipp noted. It was led by growth in AdMob and Ad Manager.
So we're really pleased with Q4. It was a great end to a challenging year. And when we think about 2021, I made the point in the opening comments, we obviously have easier year-on-year comparisons in the first half as we anniversary the effects of the pandemic. So not much more to add, we -- it was a strong quarter, and we feel really good about the level of activity. And our next question comes from Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs. Great. I appreciate the level of detail on the drivers behind the acceleration in Search and YouTube. I was wondering if you could go a bit further and disaggregate or give, even just qualitatively, the drivers behind that acceleration between pre-pandemic advertisers returning to prior spending levels versus new advertisers or new advertiser spend being allocated to the platform. Well, I think the main point is sort of this mega comment that we saw a slowdown. And as Philipp said, and we've talked about on prior calls, one of the first things that happens is a step-back and then you see, as users reengage and activity picks up and the effectiveness of advertising the ROI available, you see advertising come back in. I remember talking about this throughout last year that we had seen this actually going back to the prior financial crisis. And what you've seen is just a broad-based reengagement, which we're really pleased about across industries. And it's also -- as Philipp noted in his comments, there's been a tremendous opportunity really to step in here and help small, medium businesses as they were evolving and adapting to this new digital world, and it's been quite key there as well. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. I have two for Philipp. Philipp, first one, I appreciate all the color on retail and commerce, the merchant community growing so strong in the last year. I'd be curious to hear about your discussions now with merchants and sort of what the largest friction points that they're looking for you to solve and sort of continue to help them as the world reopens, kind of the merchant discussions. And then secondly, a question on one of the earlier products on Discover feed, I'd love to hear about sort of early learnings on Discover feed and how you think about hurdles you need to overcome to monetize that. Yes. Thank you very much for the question. Look, at the highest level, we want to build a healthier e-commerce ecosystem. When people come to Google to shop, we want them to help find the best product with the best prices from really the widest range of merchants, and we want our results to be as comprehensive and relevant as possible. And we took some significant steps last year, as you know, on Google Shopping. And in many ways, we really see them as a return to our first principles here: free listing, zero commissions, really good feedback, helps lower barriers for online retail. So we've become a great place for stores to connect with potential customers whether it's by driving traffic to the website for free listings or ads or just by making it easier for purchases to happen directly on Google. And by the way, let me be clear also, shopping ads will continue to be a powerful way for retailers to promote their products, obviously.
So overall, we're providing an open ecosystem that works for every kind of business, from national chains and online marketplaces to just your small local stores. And we're giving retailers more choice, which is very well received by opening our platform to third-party providers. We talked about this, starting with PayPal and Shopify. And we brought YouTube into the fold, and we began experimenting with a feature that lets you learn a lot more about products and videos on a limited set of channels and so on and so on. So I would say overall it's very, very well received.
On the Discover side, discovery has grown -- so discovery is Discover and, obviously, discovery ads. So Discover has grown dramatically since we launched it, I think, just 3 years ago. People are loving how we're surfacing relevant information, gorgeous visuals that are all in what we call Coriolis feed experience. And naturally, some of these experiences are commercial. And we made discovery ads generally available about 6 months ago. I think it was May 2020. And it's already reaching up to 3 billion people across Discover, YouTube, Gmail, and that's worldwide. And advertisers love how we're able to drive performance objectives by really matching their premium creatives with Google intent on our -- yes, what we call Coriolis surfaces. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian from Baird. Maybe for Sundar or Philipp, a follow-up on YouTube. Just given the strength of those services ads and subscriptions during the pandemic, I wonder if part of what we're seeing is more of an acceleration from TV ad budgets from linear spending to more of YouTube spending, I mean given also the momentum we've seen in over-the-top over the last 9 months or so. And then given some of the changing industry dynamics around privacy, including what you've already announced around browser cookies, wondering what plans might be as well for Android and how we should think about potential impact on ad revenues broadly as a result of privacy changes. Yes, I can take that. We've seen brands steadily shift budgets to YouTube to complement their linear TV buys as TV audiences really become more fragmented. And as traditional TV ratings continue to decline, TV advertisers are turning to streaming platforms like YouTube to reach people who are no longer watching TV. Connected TVs are our fastest-growing screen. In the U.S., we have over 100 million people that watch YouTube and YouTube TV on their TV screens each month. YouTube helps advertisers reach general audiences they can't reach anywhere else. We talked about it. YouTube reaches more 18- to 49-year-olds than all linear TV networks combined. And so there is an opportunity, a big opportunity, for YouTube to help brands and agencies really more easily connect with this audience. And we're very invested in this space.
And just to give you a few examples, in the second half of last year, we launched YouTube Masthead on TV screens to help advertisers drive awareness with large audiences in basically a single moment. Many are taking advantage of it: Uber, many others. We launched Brand Lift for YouTube on TV screens to really help advertisers make informed decisions about ad performance, optimize streaming campaigns in real time and so on. And we also made it possible last year for advertisers to basically buy among the most popular YouTube and YouTube TV content viewed on the TV screens in one -- what we call one single lineup.
Quickly on the third-party cookies strategy in general, we know that expectations are really changing for how data is used online, and people are demanding greater privacy. We're taking our responsibility to user privacy and to supporting our partners in the web ecosystem very, very seriously. In 2019, we announced The Privacy Sandbox, which is an open standards initiative to invent new technology that will replace third-party cookies with a set of privacy-preserving mechanisms for the web, and we're making great progress. We've shared a detailed proposal with the industry for experimentation and feedback.
We shared recently as well our what we call FLoC, our Federated Learning of Cohorts API, which we think provides an effective replacement signal for third-party cookies. And we really believe Privacy Sandbox is the best path forward, and we remain very committed to our collaboration with the ads community on privacy-preserving open standard mechanisms that can, what we call, sustain a healthy and ad-supported web. And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Philipp, I was following up on Colin's question just perfectly. I wanted to understand the framework, if you could, and think about the bigger opportunity longer term and priority highs -- priority is in streaming video, right? So are you happy with the progress of YouTube TV so far? Will you expand into other countries? And can you contrast that versus the opportunity you see in connected TVs and devices as you've done for Google TV or Chromecast? And then is there a perceived added value from advertisers for this type of inventory? Does it attract a new type of advertiser to offer YouTube TV inventory or connected TV inventory from the traditional YouTube advertising? Yes, maybe I'll comment on -- one of the things which has worked well for Google over the years is we really try to reach users where they are, and that's how Google has worked always. We've invested across platforms, across devices, across countries. And I think the same applies for the YouTube experience. We want to bring it to the screen that's most convenient for users and, hence, our investments in Google TV, Chromecast, YouTube TV as a whole itself. And I think we are taking a long-term view here, obviously focused on the user experience and really getting it all to work well. We know -- while smartphones are at the center for YouTube, TV is an important form factor. And over time, people will use it across multiple screens. And so that's the experience we are focused on. And any time we create that experience, we know, over time, there is value to be captured commercially as well that makes sense for advertisers, but we take a long-term view. Yes. And I talked about the connected TV part already. Maybe briefly just on YouTube TV, YouTube TV continues to gain momentum. Our advertising efforts on YouTube TV itself are still very, very early. But we think there is an opportunity to apply some of our targeting and measurement capabilities to really provide a better user and advertiser experience over time. And yes, we heard from customers, they have a very strong interest in advertising and streaming environments. I mentioned how we combine it in the single lineups. So that's an interesting path going forward. And our next question comes from Stephen Ju from Crédit Suisse. So Sundar, I think let's -- I think you've recently talked about a 10- to 20-year journey for AI and quantum computing to unlock new use cases. I think you brought up in the past some of the ways AI is helping you with the products that you have in market right now. But as we take a more longer-term look into the future, what do you think some of the new applications could be?
And I think, Philipp, it might have been a few years ago when you were speaking at an investor conference, and you called out the desire to onboard and help SMBs, particularly as they really had no way to advertise before. And Google, and online in general, presented a golden opportunity to really help them grow their business. So where do you think you are in terms of putting together an easy-to-use set of tools to help those who otherwise don't really have agency representation so that they can reach all the different customers that they should be reaching across all of the different services that you're offering? Thanks, Stephen. I'll answer the AI part first. We've always wanted to be foundational in how we approach technological advances, and that's the core competency. We invest across the company. We're one of the largest R&D investors in the world. And obviously, AI is a big part of it. Just I'm really excited that we -- over the past few years, while we have made progress in understanding different modalities, be it text, images, voice, vision, et cetera, there is -- we definitely -- I think we are at an inflection point, and we are investing to build better models and deepen our understanding and do it in a more generalized way. And when we do that, it will apply horizontally across our products.
You saw a version of that when we shipped Bird in Search in what was one of our biggest quality improvements, but you'll see that flow across be it Google Search, YouTube, Android as well as our investments in Alphabet, be it self-driving cars or robotics. So we take that view and, definitely, we want to make sure we are driving state-of-the-art progress. Philipp? Yes. So first, let me recognize, I mean it has obviously been a very, very challenging environment for SMBs. Many weren't online. Many lost line of sight to demand overnight due to COVID. So around this time last year, as soon as we saw the scale of the impact, we really accelerated product that give our customers, and especially our SMB customers, signals to help them actually navigate and pivot. And as I noted earlier, as more consumers moved online and advertisers obviously responded by reactivating spend, we also saw our advertiser base grow, particularly the number of smaller advertisers or SMBs, and we're helping them see shift in supply and demand not just across sectors but actually within sectors. For example, travel continues to get hit hard, hit pretty hard. And after the initial lockdown last year, searches for vacation homes and near-me rentals saw huge spikes, and that continues to fluctuate.
On the other hand, if we look at retail, demand isn't disappearing. It's shifting in many cases. We're seeing increases in searches for things like gym equipment, crafts, patio heaters and so on, anything related to outdoor activity and so on. We're obviously thinking about how to help SMBs on products like Maps. Like, over the last 5 years, we've made more than 1,000 improvements to business profiles, making it a lot easier for merchants to connect with customers and especially now into the crisis. In 2020, we added new features to, for example, provide COVID updates, service changes and new attributes like takeout, delivery, curbside pickup, now all easily available for consumers on Maps to connect them to their favorite SMBs, so a really incredible investment, frankly, from our side, and I think it's very well received. Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any closing remarks. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter 2021 call. Thank you, and have a good evening. Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.","a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release . this year, we are proud that people continue to choose Google's products to stay informed, connected and comforted during uncertain times . the past year also accelerated the shift to cloud and adoption of online services . today, I'll review some of the important work we have done this quarter across Google and Alphabet .",1.0

And thank you for standing by for the Alphabet First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
I’d now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. And welcome to Alphabet’s first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai; Philipp Schindler; and Ruth Porat.
Now I will quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations and financial performance, including the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on those areas may be considered forward-looking and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC.
During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today’s earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor.
And now, I will turn the call over to Sundar. Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. After hard year people in some parts of the world are beginning to rebuild their lives, businesses and communities. But recovery is far from uniform across the globe as the tragic scenes in countries like India and Brazil reminders.
We are continuing to help support public health officials in their vital and urgent work. Our focus is on providing authoritative information. We are helping over 100 government agencies and non-profits worldwide, distribute critical information and billions of PSAs about COVID-19 and vaccines, and Google Cloud technologies powering a virtual agent to help make vaccination appointments over the phone, supporting 28 languages and dialects for those with limited internet access. We are focused on doing our part to help.
In some parts of the world, the economy began to rebound, which created a rising tide in the first quarter that benefited a number of sectors, including existing and emerging companies and partners. For example, data suggests that investment in startups is at an all time high.
Our product releases are returning to a regular cadence. I am particularly excited that our developer event Google I/O is back this year, all virtual and free for everyone on May 18th through 20th. We will have significant product updates and announcements and I invite you all to tune in.
Today, I will briefly mention a few highlights from the past quarter and go a bit deeper on Cloud. Then Philip will discuss advertising and partnership developments. Finally, Ruth will cover the quarterly results.
Quickly turning to product highlights of the quarter. Our knowledge and information services like Search and Maps remain at the heart of our mission to provide helpful and accurate information during important moments.
People have turned to Google Search more than ever since the pandemic began. We see hundreds of millions of searches every day for COVID and related to health information. People are also searching for jobs. To help them job seekers can now use search to quickly and easily find roles that do not require a college degree and we are working together with a top employment websites to make the service even better.
Maps we will be adding over 100 AI powered improvements this year, such as indoor live view which helps you navigate airports, transit stations and malls using augmented reality.
Last quarter I mentioned Google News showcase, our $1 billion investment in the news industry. I am pleased to see continued momentum this quarter with new launches in the U.K., Italy, Argentina and Australia. In Q1 we added more than 170 publications across 12 countries with more coming soon.
With respect to YouTube, people continue to find all types of informational content from educational videos to podcast. In fact, according to a recent study conducted by IPSOS 77% of respondents say they used YouTube during 2020 to learn a new skill. YouTube Shorts continues to gain popularity with over 6.5 billion daily views as of March, up from 3.5 billion at the end of 2020.
We have added a new metric to our transparency report called the Violative View Rate, which will help us estimate what percentage of views on YouTube come from content that violates our policy. In Q4 of last year, YouTube’s Violative View Rate was between 16 and 18 views out of every 10,000. This is down over 70% compared to the same quarter in 2017. In large part, thanks to our investments in machine learning.
And we also mentioned Chrome OS, which this quarter celebrated 10 years. It’s been a valuable tool for millions of students and teachers during the pandemic. According to third parties, Chromebooks were the most popular device in K through 12 Education globally for the last year.
Next I will move to Cloud, where we continue to see strong performance across both Google Cloud Platform and Workspace. Q1 revenue grew 46% year-over-year, with GCP’s revenue growth rate once again meaningfully about Cloud overall. We continue to unlock the value of the Google ecosystem by signing multiyear multi-product partnerships with companies like Global Payments and Grupo Global.
And just yesterday, we announced a new Google-wide partnership with Univision, which is migrating to our cloud, continuing to distribute content on YouTube and reaching customers we are play and act.
In cloud, there are three distinct market trends, shaping our growth and driving our product and go-to-market strategy. First, we see very strong customer momentum in the Data Cloud. Our expertise in real-time data and analytics is winning companies like Twitter and Ingersoll Rand who are moving their complex data workloads to Google Cloud.
Our strength in AI and ML is also helping financial services customers, like HSBC, Commerce Bank, SCB Group and BBVA improve efficiency of payments, reduce fraud and risk, and deliver faster payment solutions. This past quarter, we release new functionality for BigQuery, delivering significantly better performance for business intelligence queries.
Second, we are seeing customers wanting a robust infrastructure cloud in order to create operational efficiencies and reduce IT costs. We are winning large IT transformation deals with companies that are migrating their data centers to Google Cloud. Multi-cloud remains a differentiator as it provides the easiest and most open development environment for customers like Taylor’s allowing them to access and move the data between various plants.
Third, we continue to deliver helpful innovations to enable hybrid work with Google Workspace. This includes digital tools for frontline workers like nurses and retail store workers, as well as new security offerings. These innovations have helped grow our revenue proceed and the number of seats in the last quarter. Workspace is being adopted by customers including Verily in healthcare, Sun Life in financial services and Airbus in manufacturing and aviation.
Now, a brief update on autonomous. Waymo’s fully autonomous public ride hailing service in Phoenix is providing hundreds of rides per week. In San Francisco Waymo’s began limited employee testing. I am pleased by the progress here and look forward to Waymo’s continued momentum under the leadership of new co-CEOs, Tekedra and Dmitri.
Calico and its partner AbbVie announced that it has entered clinical stage programs for new drug therapies for cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, like ALS, Parkinson’s disease and traumatic brain injury.
Before I close, I want to mention that in 2021, in the U.S. alone, we plan to invest over $7 billion in offices and data centers, and create at least 10,000 new full-time jobs. And as we do this, we continue to make progress on our sustainability goals.
We matched our operations with 100% renewable energy for the past four years and we are working towards operating on carbon-free energy round the clock by 2030, a far more ambitious goal that we hope will be transformative for the industry. Five of our data centers in Europe and North America, are already operating near or at 90% carbon-free energy around the clock.
We are also working towards our commitment to help 1 billion people make more sustainable choices with our services by 2022. One example of how we are doing this is a new AI powered feature in Maps that will show the route with the lowest carbon footprint when ETAs are the same. You will also be able to compare the carbon impact between routes.
Finally, as we look ahead to the rest of 2021, our four big themes continue to guide us, first, building and providing the most helpful products and services, second, continuing to earn the trust of our users by investing in high quality information and keeping users data safe and private, third, strong execution as a company, particularly as we start to reopen our offices, and fourth, building sustainable value in our own business and for our partners.
As always, thank you to our Googlers around the world for a great start to the year. To everyone. I look forward to seeing you at I/O. Over to Philipp. Thanks, Sundar, and good afternoon, everyone. It’s great to be joining you again today. We are pleased with a strong growth in Google Services revenues in the first quarter. Year-on-year performance reflects elevated consumer online activity, broad-based strength and advertiser spend, and lapping of the initial impact of the pandemic on advertising revenues that began in March last year.
In the first quarter in Search, we saw sustained strength across most categories led by retail. We also saw strong performance in tech and CPG. In YouTube, we had phenomenal growth driven by Direct Response, followed by continued strength in brand.
We have seen great momentum in TrueView for action ads, with a number of advertisers using the format doubling over the past year. In Network exceptional growth was driven by AdMob and Ad Manager with particular strength in app campaigns. Google other revenues were driven by growth in Google Play and YouTube’s non-advertising revenues, followed by hardware.
I would now like to take a few minutes to dive deeper into the trends we are seeing in our business. As Sundar touched on earlier, the pandemic is evolving in different ways across the world. Some countries are in advanced stages of reopening, others are facing reacceleration of cases and there’s everything in between. It’s never been more important to help businesses navigate the pandemic as circumstances change.
On travel, we are starting to see a renewed interest from users as they turn to Google to plan their next trip, even before they are ready to book. Every travel partner is looking to understand where demand is going and we are helping them find these opportunities through insights and automation.
For American Airlines, for example, that meant using our insight tools to anticipate demand on untapped routes. These newly prioritized routes had a significantly higher booking rate in Search this quarter, compared to last quarter.
Also, just last month, we made it free for hotels and travel companies to list their booking links, similar to what we did with shopping last year. For consumers, it means more choice. For hotels and travel companies, it means free exposure on Google. For advertisers, it means paid campaigns can be augmented with free listings. We are already seeing positive results across the Board.
Let me switch gears now and talk about retail where we had a very strong quarter. As you know, we have taken important steps over the past year to accelerate an open retail ecosystem. We made product listings free, remove commission fees and open our shopping platform to Shopify and PayPal.
We are also helping retailers lean into some key opportunities, such as innovating in omnichannel, as the line between digital and physical retail continues to blur and tapping into commercial intent on YouTube and other surfaces. Let me talk about both.
Over the last six months people’s shopping preferences have shifted constantly in response to changing conditions. It’s not just online. It’s not just offline. It’s a mix. And that’s our sweet spot with Search, Maps and YouTube.
Last quarter we talked about a search and searches for available near me and curbside pickup. That trend has not changed. Searches for local and businesses are up 80% versus last year. Omnichannel is here to stay.
Take Dick’s Sporting Goods. Throughout the pandemic they accelerated curbside pickup, pickup in store and ship from store fulfillment options in Search. This approach contributed to 100% year-over-year increase in e-commerce sales in 2020. And just recently, they activated YouTube to build awareness for new store concepts.
Michaels, the arts and crafts store also activated their omnichannel fulfillment approach using Search and Maps. And to meet surging demand for art supplies, they use TrueView for action to tap into the vast number of arts and crafts searches happening on YouTube. In 2020, their e-commerce sales were up 350%.
We are also doing more to help merchants tap into the incredible innate commercial behavior across Search and YouTube. Google Merchants can now plug their product feeds right into the video action campaigns and early adopters are seeing huge results.
Luxury cosmetics company, Clarins HK had beautiful product imagery from their Google Merchant feed as an extension and saw 68% conversion rate uplift within three weeks. Any merchant can now light this up with a single click in our Google Merchant Center.
Speaking of YouTube, we are helping advertisers address both brand and performance goals at scale, driving higher return on ad spend at a time when they needed most. We are only a few years in on Direct Response and we think there’s significant opportunity for innovation that will improve the user experience and provide better ROI for advertisers.
On the performance side, advertisers of all sizes are actually seeing incredible results. Like Globo Group fitness company, Les Mills was hit hard when their 20,000 partner gyms closed during lockdown. They accelerated digital and grew app subscribers by almost 7x with TrueView for Action.
We are seeing strong growth in YouTube’s Brand business, fueled by global consumer trend from linear TV toward streaming video. With over 2 billion monthly logged in users and over 1 billion hours of video watched every day, YouTube is offering advertisers efficient reach to large audiences, which are incremental to those found on TV.
Large brands are benefiting from this trend. Taco Bell saw 27% incremental reach for their limited time offer campaigns and Kellogg’s saw incremental reach of over 30% for their recent Special K campaign.
Before I close, I want to take a minute to highlight our work with partners. Sundar mentioned Google News Showcase. We now have deals with 600 plus publishers across more than 12 countries. Le Monde in France, Der Spiegel and Stern in Germany, Clarin in Argentina, Evening Standard in the U.K., just to name a few and we are continuing to expand the program.
We are also developing more valuable relationships with some of our strategic partners. By teaming up, we are able to build new experiences for our users while helping our partners innovate and grow.
We have gone well beyond ads to bring the best of Google across Cloud, Play, YouTube and more to help them do just that. Sundar mentioned Univision, in the quarter we also announced T-Mobile, Albertsons, Allianz and Munich Re.
I want to thank our customers and partners for their collaboration. We have always said, we succeed only when they succeed. And I also want to think of product, partnership, sales and support teams for their amazing work and innovation.
I will now hand off the call to Ruth. Thank you, Philipp. Our very strong financial results in the first quarter reflect both lapping the impact of COVID on our business beginning in March 2020, as well as the benefit of excellent underlying operating performance.
My focus will be on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook.
For the first quarter, our consolidated revenues were $55.3 billion, up 34% or up 32% in constant currency, reflecting elevated consumer activity online and broad-based increases in advertiser spending within Google Services, as well as ongoing strength in Google Cloud.
Our total cost of revenues was $24.1 billion up 27%, primarily driven by other cost of revenues, which was $14.4 billion up 25%, followed by TAC, which was $9.7 billion, up 30%. Within Other cost of revenues, the biggest factors are, first, content acquisition costs, primarily driven by costs for YouTube’s advertising supported content, followed by costs for subscription content.
And second, costs associated with data centers and other operations, offset partially by a reduction in depreciation expense due to changes to estimated useful lives of servers in certain network equipment.
Operating expenses were $14.8 billion, up 4%. In terms of the three component parts of OpEx. First, the increase in R&D expenses was driven primarily by headcount growth.
Second, sales and marketing expenses were essentially flat, reflecting headcount growth, which was offset by lower spend on ads and promo, as well as on travel and entertainment.
Finally, the decline in G&A reflects the benefit of lapping the unusually high allowances for credit losses recorded in the first quarter of 2020 due to the impact of COVID offset by charges relating to certain legal matters.
Headcount was up 4,694 from the fourth quarter, including more than 1,800 Fitbit employees who joined us in Q1. Again, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers.
Operating income was $16.4 billion, up 106% and our operating margin in the quarter was 30%. Other income and expense was $4.8 billion, which primarily reflects unrealized gains in the value of investments in equity securities. Net income was $17.9 billion. Operating cash flow was $19.3 billion, with free cash flow of $13.3 billion in the quarter and $50.7 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the first quarter with $135 billion in cash and marketable securities.
Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with our Google Services segment. Total Google Services revenues were $51.2 billion up 34%, consisting of Google Search and other advertising revenues of $31.9 billion in the quarter up 30%, with strength across most categories led by retail.
YouTube advertising revenues of $6 billion up 49%, driven by exceptional performance in Direct Response and ongoing strength in brand advertising. Network advertising revenues of $6.8 billion up 30%, driven by AdMob and Ad Manager.
Other revenues were $6.5 billion up 46%, primarily driven by growth in Play and YouTube non-advertising revenues followed by hardware, which benefited from the addition of Fitbit revenues. Google Services operating income was $19.5 billion, up 69% and the operating margin was 38%.
Turning to the Google Cloud segment, including GCP and Google Workspace, revenues were $4 billion for the first quarter up 46%. GCP’s revenue growth was again meaningfully above Cloud overall. Strong growth in Google Workspace revenues was driven by growth in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had an operating loss of $1 billion. As to our Other Bets, in the first quarter, revenues were $198 million. The operating loss was $1.1 billion.
Let me end with our outlook for each segment and our investments more broadly. For Google Services, for the remainder of 2021, year-over-year comparisons will be affected meaningfully by the impact of COVID last year, with a greater benefit in Q2 from an easier comp relative to what you saw in Q1 and then beginning to lap stronger performance in the second half of the year.
In the first quarter, we continue to benefit from elevated consumer online activity and broad-based strength in advertiser spend. It is too early to say how durable this consumer behavior will be as economies recover and restrictions on mobility are lifted.
Within Other revenues, Play benefited from an increased level of user engagement starting in Q1 last year due to the pandemic, which we are now beginning to lap.
In terms of investment levels within Google Services, we still intend to invest aggressively to support the extraordinary opportunities we see. That being said, in some areas, like, travel and entertainment and marketing events, the pace of investment through the balance of the year may be affected by the pace of COVID recovery globally.
As for Google Cloud, our approach to building the business has not changed. We remain focused on revenue growth and we will continue to invest aggressively in products and our go-to-market organization, given the opportunity we see.
The operating results in Q1, in part reflects some notable items in the quarter. First, the lapping of the unusually high allowances for credit losses recorded in the first quarter of 2020, as I already mentioned. And second, lower depreciation expense due to the change in the estimated useful lives. Although, the dollar benefit will diminish throughout the course of the year across segments.
As we have noted previously, operating results should benefit from increased scale over time. However, at this point, we do remain focused on continuing to invest to build the cloud organization for long-term performance. In terms of Other Bets, we continue to invest with a focus on the long-term value creation opportunity.
Turning to CapEx, at a consolidated level, the results reflect ongoing investment in our technical infrastructure, offset by a slower pace of investment in office facilities, given the ongoing impact of COVID. Within technical infrastructure, servers continue to be the largest driver of investment, as we continue to invest to support Cloud, Search, Ads and machine learning.
Finally, with respect to capital allocation, our primary use of capital continues to be to support organic growth in our businesses, followed by retaining flexibility for acquisitions and investments. We complement these growth drivers with a return of capital. As we indicated in our press release today, our Board has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $50 billion of our Class C stock.
Thank you. And now, Sundar, Philipp and I will take your questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two, first one for Sundar. I appreciate the color on the four key priorities. I wanted to dig a little more into the build and provide the most helpful products and services. Maybe if you can sort of talk to us about Search, how do you think about the key investment priorities and innovation areas to continue to make Search more and more helpful for your users and your advertisers? And the second one for Philipp, maybe similar question on YouTube, you have done such a great job in innovation around YouTube? Where do you see the largest incremental opportunities for further innovation at YouTube to deliver more outsized value for your advertisers? Thanks. Thanks. On Search, great question. I still think we are in very early stages. Recent example, which I was proud of was when the ship was stuck in the Suez Canal and then it got out. If you ask the question to Google, I think, very soon after that we had the right answer.
It seems obvious to do except we need to provide right answers and without giving wrong answers or misinformation for many other things. So to do that is where all our underlying investments go and that’s how we think about it over the long-term.
BERT last year, I think, was a great example of it. It was one of our biggest quality improvements and that was based on the transformer breakthrough from our Google AI team, which laid the foundation for it.
So we are continuing to invest that way in the deep technology as the web is scaling up. There’s more information than ever before. So that’s a big part of what we are doing. Beyond that, there is a lot of opportunity to improve the user experience. You have seen our efforts around shopping. That’s one aspect of how we are working hard to improve the experience there. So but we are looking at it pretty deeply. Philipp? Yes. On the YouTube side, let me start with our Direct Response business, growth was truly exceptional this quarter. DR was practically non-existent on YouTube a few years ago and it’s now a large and fast growing business and we are just getting started in my view.
People already, as you know, go to YouTube to decide what they want to buy and we want to make it easier for them to buy and make the discovery process overall a lot easier. And for creators, we launched new shoppable capabilities. So viewers can actually make purchases from their favorite creators directly on YouTube.
Just as an example, as part of our Brand Connect program, Calvin Klein tested these and drove over. I think it was, 200% lift in brand search and sold out multiple products actually. For merchants, they can now bring their product feeds directly into their video campaigns and I think we are still scratching the surface on what’s possible really with commercial intent on YouTube.
And then there is, of course, the opportunity to be a major platform for brands. Historical approaches to reaching audiences through, let’s just say, call it, linear TV don’t really work anymore. Advertisers are using YouTube now to reach the audience they can’t find anywhere else. And remember more 18- to 49-year-olds are actually watching YouTube than all linear TV combined and brands are also seeing more incremental reach on YouTube compared to TV.
So we are starting to see advertisers by a mix actually of awareness and more action oriented formats. They are driving reach and results across the funnel from awareness to consideration to action. So we see a lot of really interesting opportunities here. Great. Thank you both. Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Thanks for taking the questions. I have two, first, Ruth, just want to ask you about Cloud. You saw some significant benefits just from the change in useful life. But I think in the past, you talked about 1Q perhaps being the biggest loss of the year. I was just curious if that’s still the case in your view going forward? And then, secondly, just given the management transition that we have seen at Waymo, should we expect any change in terms of how things are operated there going forward? Thank you. Thanks for the question. So in terms of Cloud and overall performance, I think, the main point I would say is, I wouldn’t extrapolate generally from quarter-to-quarter, given we are still in the early stages of building the business. We do intend to continue to invest meaningfully in Cloud given the opportunity.
And so as you said, there were a couple of things that benefited margins in the quarter, both the depreciation expense item, but also lapping the unusually high allowance for credit losses that were recorded back in the first quarter.
So, the main takeaway is we are continuing to invest. We will invest aggressively in products and go-to-market where we have talked about quite consistently over time. And it’s much as operating losses and operating margin will benefit from increased scale over time. At this point, we do remain focused on investing to build the organization for long-term performance. And Doug on Waymo, John is stepping down our CEO and it’s been -- he’s been planning for this transition, and Dmitri and Tekedra have been working closely with him. And so, we will continue our investments there.
Pretty excited that the fully autonomous experience of Waymo One is available in Phoenix and we are also accelerating the development of our next-generation Waymo Driver to deploy it in San Francisco.
And this past quarter, Waymo had begun limited rider testing in San Francisco. And so really focused on making sure we make the hard technical progress, so that we can operationalize this and so we will continue as executing toward that. Okay. Thank you both. Thank you. And our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Thanks. As it relates to some of the harder hit industries, I am curious if you could just characterize the shape of the recovery what you are seeing across travel and in some of the other sectors? And have there been any verticals that you have yet to see recover that may pullout in the second half of the year? Thank you. So, overall, what we indicated is the strong results reflect, in part lapping the impact that we saw starting late in Q1 of last year and then a pickup in a number of areas. I think the main thing we would want to leave you with is that, we are seeing, in part an acceleration in the shift to digital, but it is too early to forecast the extent to which these changes in consumer behavior and advertising spend will endure.
There are some obvious examples, if you think about, for example, the bump in consumption for things like outfitting your home to work-from-home, obviously that doesn’t repeat and so our main thing is that we think it’s premature at this point to really assess that how durable this consumer behavior trends are. In travel, specifically, have you -- can you just give us any color in terms of what you are seeing on that front? Yeah. Nothing more to add. Philipp had a couple of comments about some of the areas where we are trying to innovate to be helpful to our partners, but beyond that nothing to add. Great. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Maybe one for Philipp and one for Ruth. First, Philipp, you mentioned a couple of times the durability of the improvement is tough to gauge. Maybe you can help us understand what the key drivers of Search that you are thinking about over the next couple of years? Is it queries, product improvements, certain changes in verticals like shopping? How are you thinking about driving Search growth? And then maybe for Ruth, model showed great efficiency last year on the cost side and margins. Anything you are learning or experiences during the pandemic that we can think about post-pandemic on cost efficiencies or things like that? Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you so much for the question. I usually look at the different components of Search as basically four key drivers. The first one obviously being the queries, so are we really the best place for users to turn to when they need information.
The second one is, I would call it, as coverage. So what percent of coverage is really commercial and then what percentage are we actually covering with ads. And then we need to ask ourselves, do both of these have upside.
The third one is click-through rates or individual. At click-through rates close to being optimized, is there more we can do it here by just delivering better creative, better ads, better answers, to what extent can we deploy next-generation machine learning here.
And then the last one is obviously the CPC, right? How much is someone willing to bid for click on their ad and this is obviously to a large extent driven by the quality of traffic we are sending, and then conversion rate is a big driver of this.
So we are working very closely with our partners, advertisers and so on across the world to help them optimize their conversion rates and their O/I. Those are really the four big components and I am excited about all four of them actually. In terms of your question on efficiency, appreciate the question. I think, at the highest level, the approach is unchanged. Our approach on investing capital allocation is first and foremost to support long-term growth with financially sustainable businesses. It’s about being sharper within product areas and then making sure we are investing.
And what I keep referring to is operational excellence, things like our technical infrastructure, systems to improve productivity, to improve velocity of our product teams and then the very important efforts around privacy and security and content moderation.
And I think, to your question, the experiences of this past year underscored really the value of having made those investments to protect and support operational excellence. It really served us well and customers in our ability to deliver throughout this period of time.
So that framework is unaltered. I think that part of what you are seeing in the first quarter, I have said it a couple of times now, but are some notable items in the quarter. The lapping of the allowance for credit losses, the benefit from depreciation life and then there were certain things that were due to COVID just the lower impact for things like T&E and marketing.
And so the main point is we will continue to invest for long-term growth, so that in both areas, Google Services and Cloud, and we will continue to maintain that framework that you referenced about looking for efficiencies where they are, but ensuring that we can deliver for users and customers. Great. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian from Baird. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. Sundar, first, you have highlighted for years that machine learning is clearly a strength and differentiation of the overall platform, including in Cloud Services, where we are also seeing competitors focus more on their capabilities here. So I am wondering if you could talk about the pace of change around data science and how Google can sustain its competitive advantage in those areas? And then, Philipp, I wanted to follow-up on the momentum in Search that you attribute to Google Shopping. Is it fair to say that the shift to free product listings has led to the desired increase in retail advertising across the platform or are there other reasons beyond the pandemic that you attribute for that success? Thanks. Colin, on -- thanks. Obviously, as we are thinking about AI, it all starts with foundational R&D we do. I think we are one of the largest R&D investors in AI in the world. And so thinking ahead and doing that and we are doing it across all the foundational areas and we are taking many diverse approaches.
So as we make breakthroughs, I earlier spoke about transformers and how that translated as BERT to improve search quality. And similarly we are very committed to taking the AI improvements and bringing it through our GCP offerings to our enterprise customers as well.
So it’s an approach we are deeply committed to and we are thinking as it -- at all layers of the stack. So this is why you see us work hard on TPUs and we think about the tool chain for developers on top of all that.
And so -- and I think if I look at the progress ahead, I think, there’s a lot more progress coming down the pipe and so I am pretty excited and that’s why I feel Google -- GCP will be differentiated over time as our competitive advantage. Philipp, over to you. Yes. And on the Shopping side, look, it’s been a year since we brought Bill onboard, Bill Ready and we pivoted our Shopping strategy to better support retailers and consumers, trying to really build an open retail ecosystem and we are pleased with the progress we are making.
As you said, free listings and zero commissions have actually lowered various online retail. Shopping ads continue to be a powerful way for retailers to promote their products and the combination of free and paid is a meaningful one.
We had a set of new partnerships with Shopify and PayPal that are giving retailers a lot more choice. And we will continue to simplify the, let me call it, end-to-end user and merchant experience, of course.
In particular, we are trying to streamline and working hard to streamline the back-end experience for merchants, especially for hybrid retailers. So, retailers that play in both brick-and-mortar and in digital. And overall we want to make it much, much easier for retailers to get started on Google and have their information appear across surfaces and I mentioned overall strength in retail before. So thank you. Thanks, guys. Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from ISI. Your line is now open. Thanks. I wanted to ask about your attempts to retain advertisers, and I ask it this way, I think, we have had record numbers of new business formations in the country and around the world on the unfortunate impact of COVID. But I think that’s my guess is, it’s been a huge tailwind for your business? At the same time we have had this real tip over I think of linear TV ad budgets in the back half of the year onto online channels like YouTube. So talk about these new advertisers that you have brought on to the Google platform? What you have been able to do? How confident you are in your ability to retain them, you are advertiser retention strategy? Thanks a lot. So, I can take this. I mean a lot of the new advertisers that you are referring to are obviously SMBs and there is no doubt that this has been a challenging year for SMBs. The pandemic has disrupted how many of them connect with their customers.
But frankly, the pandemic has also been a catalyst for key consumer trends. Obviously, creating a lot of new opportunities for small businesses, and obviously, consumers are spending more time online. They are buying more online. They were willing to try new brands and they are eager to support local businesses, SMBs.
So searches for support local businesses are up significantly since last year and we have been focused really on helping SMBs with simpler tools, so they can actually embrace digital a lot faster.
And that’s where we have really invested over the year, making everything simpler. We had a very wide range of solutions to help them get online, get discovered across all of our key product, Search, Maps, YouTube and so on. There is multiple, multiple fascinating stories from them coming back to us and we see this positively reflected in our rates here as well. Okay. Thank you, Philipp. Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open. Thank you. I have two, one, Philipp, one for Ruth. So on -- the question is on Search. I wonder if we step back, which categories, which geographies, do you think you are still under represented as a percentage of marketing spending, where we could see potentially even more lift to come? And then to Ruth, we always asked in the past that CapEx spending in order to change useful life. But I wonder has this pandemic change maybe your approach to the office space that you bought and thinking about how the company is going to deploy capital in terms of space going forward and how we think about the future of CapEx next couple of years based on post-pandemic? Philipp seems to be on mute. I will go ahead and start on the CapEx… Okay. Yeah. … question. Thank you. So, in terms of CapEx, I think, I will address two parts. You asked about office facilities, but I do think it’s important to know, we are continuing to invest in our technical infrastructure and that’s what you saw again here this quarter and we will continue to do so to support growth that we are seeing in Cloud, in Search, in Ads and machine learning, no change there.
So you will be seeing that. But the core of your question was really about office facilities and I think it’s -- we have been very clear, we do value bringing people together in the office and we are looking at a hybrid work-from-home/work-from-office model.
As we look forward at developing our real estate footprint for offices, what we factor into it is, first, we are growing our headcount, we are looking at less density per employee. So even with a hybrid work environment, we will continue to need space and so we are continuing to build out our campuses and office facilities.
What you saw in the first quarter was a slightly slower pace for that and a slower pace on fit-outs, as well as we are evolving what does the space look like. But we expect to continue to pick up the pace there as we fit out our spaces for this kind of a new re-imagined environment. So we will continue to be investing in campuses around the globe as we have been. Yes. And on your first part of your question, look, we are looking at our business from a very global perspective and are excited about it. Keep in mind, we are not just addressing above the line marketing budgets from an addressable market perspective, so not just traditional advertising, TV advertising and so on.
Below the line budgets are really significant, everything promotional pricing, product placements, sponsorships and so on and so on. So there is this massive acceleration in e-commerce due to the pandemic. Still more than 80% of commerce is still offline. So there is a huge opportunity here across the world for us to tap into those other budgets.
There are really traditional use in a very different context. So there is plenty of room for growth here and I talked about how we look at it from a query’s perspective from a commercial instant -- intent perspective. We are trying to use machine learning really smartly here.
But the real focus in the end has to be, how do we actually make our partner successful, how do we drive incremental ROI for them and as long as we continue this well, I think, we should continue to see budgets move our way as well. Thank you. Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Hi, guys. You mentioned the strength in the supply side products in the Network business. I am wondering if you might be able to comment on how the demand side products are doing. And maybe in a similar vein, some of the changes you have made in that technology over the last few years? May have had the effect of drawing some of your advertiser customers more deeply into your tech stack, wondering if this is also creating a strong on ramp in GCP specifically around data analytic products like BigQuery? Thanks. So in terms of overall on Network revenues, as I think I noted briefly in opening comments, what we are really seeing is the ongoing strength in advertiser spend, both Philipp and I talked about that.
Particularly what we saw was AdMob and Ad Manager, and particular strength in app campaigns. And all of this just underscores what each of us commented on that. The results do reflect what was broad based strength across our partners’ properties in the first quarter. Thanks, Ruth. Thank you. Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I’d like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any closing remarks. Thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter 2021 call. Thank you and have a good evening. This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.","a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release . we are continuing to help support public health officials in their vital and urgent work . in some parts of the world, the economy began to rebound .",1.0

Thank you for standing by for the Alphabet Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Alphabet’s second quarter earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler and Ruth Porat.
Now, I’ll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations and financial performance, including the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on those areas may be considered forward-looking and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC.
During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today’s earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor.
And now I’ll turn the call over to Sundar. Thank you, Jim. And good afternoon, everyone. It’s good to be with you. Today, I'll give an overview of the quarter, going through some of our product momentum, then touching on Cloud and YouTube.
First, I want to acknowledge that the new COVID-19 variants have been challenging for so many communities across the world. As the pandemic evolves, we want to help people get the information they need to keep themselves and their families safe. I really encourage everyone to get the vaccine when it's available to you.
Turning to the quarter, we saw a rising tide of online consumer and business activity. We are proud that our services helped so many businesses and partners. In fact, we set a number of records this quarter. This quarter, publisher partners earned more than they ever have from our network.
We also paid more to YouTube creators and partners than in any quarter in our history. And on top of that, over the past year, we have sent more traffic to third-party websites than any year prior, in addition to generating billions of direct connections like phone calls, directions, ordering food and making reservations that drove customers and revenue to businesses around the world that are working to get back on their feet.
A few years ago, we placed a bet on AI believing that it would be a fundamental technology that would underpin and dramatically improve all our products. That vision was on full display at our I/O event in May where we announced new advancements that will be helpful to people and businesses everywhere.
As one example, we introduced Multitask Unified Models or MUM. MUM is a big advancement in Search, a thousand times more powerful than our current systems. It has the ability to learn and transfer knowledge across 75 languages, which means that it can learn from sources in one language and help bring that information to you in another.
We also announced a new AI system called LaMDA that achieves a new level of natural conversation capabilities. We think LaMDA will help make information and computing more accessible and we are excited about this early stage research.
And last week, DeepMind shared its new AlphaFold Protein Structure Database, which doubled the number of high accuracy human protein structures available to researchers. In the coming months, it will include almost every sequence protein known to science.
Turning to Android. We previewed Android 12 at Google I/O. The latest version will include new ways to personalize devices and significantly improved speed and power efficiency. We have built new privacy protections directly into the OS, such as the new Privacy Dashboard, to help people keep information safe and private.
Android 12 will, of course, be central to Google's phone [ph] devices. I'm very excited by our fall lineup, which will showcase Android 12 and some of the deep technology investments that are helping us push boundaries.
Pixel remains at the heart of that long-term strategy and I’m proud of how the team continues to deliver the best of Google through our family of helpful devices, including Nest and Fitbit. You can see all of these devices at our first retail store in New York City and I'm looking forward to seeing some new ones there soon.
We are also seeing developers getting tremendous benefit from Google Play. Through the end of Q2, over $120 billion has been earned cumulatively by developers around the world from Google Play.
Let me talk a bit more about Cloud. Q2 revenue grew 54% year-over-year. Our innovative products, focused go-to-market strategy and growing ecosystem are driving our momentum.
Organizations across industries are choosing Google Cloud as their platform for digital transformation, including SAP customers like PayPal, Johnson Controls and Whirlpool, who have deployed SAP environments on Google Cloud.
This quarter we saw three distinct trends. First, the increase in cyber and ransomware attacks is a wakeup call for the industry. Over two decades, Google has built some of the most secure computing systems in the world. And we are proud that our Google Cloud customers can benefit from our experience here.
Customers like Major League Baseball are partnering with Google Cloud to further enhance their security program. We pioneered the Zero Trust approach, an architecture that builds in multiple layers of defense against unauthorized access. This approach and other security solutions help customers minimize the impact of cyber attacks and prevent them completely.
At our Cloud Security Summit last week, we announced new solutions across our portfolio of products. BT is bringing our new security operation solutions based on Chronicle to the managed security services market. And Adobe and the State of Wisconsin are helping product users with our fraud detection product.
Second, our expertise in real-time data and analytics continues to differentiate us in the data cloud, one of the fastest growing segments of the market. BigQuery is not only a data warehouse, it's a platform for customer innovation and it's helping drive our strong year-over-year growth with customers like HCA Healthcare, who will be using BigQuery to analyze data to improve clinical care.
Additionally, our deep expertise in AI and machine learning remains a key differentiator, winning customers like Groupe Casino and leading to partnerships with industrial automation leaders like Siemens. Our focus on delivering industry-specific solutions, coupled with our secure open cloud infrastructure, enable us to support leading telecommunications companies such as Reliance Jio, Telecom Italia Tim and Ericsson to work together on applications and new solutions for 5G networks and mobile edge computing. These join existing customers Vodafone, Telus and many others.
Third, Google Workspace continues to show strong growth, particularly in the enterprise space because we have designed the product to meet the challenges of hybrid work. This includes the announcements we made at I/O about Smart Canvas, as well as expanding our advanced security and compliance capabilities and solutions for front-line workers. These innovations are landing wins with companies like Carvana, the online auto retailer, and software company, Red Hat.
Turning next to YouTube. YouTube Shorts continues to gain momentum. We've been rolling it out everywhere YouTube is available in more than 100 countries worldwide. I'm proud to announce that YouTube Shorts has just surpassed 15 billion daily views.
Also pleased with the progress we are making with YouTube subscription products across Music, Premium and YouTube TV, each delivering a fantastic experience and content for viewers.
And finally, Waymo continues to build and commercialize the Waymo driver and grow the team. People love the fully autonomous ride-hailing service in Phoenix. Since first launching its services to the public in October 2020, Waymo safely served tens of thousands of rights without a human driver in the vehicle, and we look forward to many more.
Before I close, let me call out our continued work on sustainability, which has been a core value for us since our founding. As you'll recall, we were the first to announce an ambitious goal that will be transformative for the industry. We aim to operate on 24/7 carbon free energy by 2030.
In Q2, we announced that 5 of our data centers are already operating at or near 90% carbon-free energy. To help us reach our target everywhere, we implemented a system to shift flexible computing tasks at different times and places with greater availability of carbon-free energy, and we are working to enable geothermal power in more places starting in Nevada next year.
I want to thank all our employees around the world for their contributions to a great quarter. I know it's been a challenging 18 months. Through it all, taking care of everyone in our workforce has remained a top priority.
Now we are re-imagining the future of work with flexibility as a guiding principle. I was excited to see so many people in person as we started a voluntary return to our California offices recently. As we make our way back, we are giving employees more flexibility in how and where they work, and we'll continue to invest in our sites in the US and elsewhere. Over to Philipp. Thanks, Sundar. And hello, everyone. It's great to be with you today. We are pleased with the growth in Google Services revenues in the second quarter. Year-on-year performance reflects elevated consumer online activity, broad based strength in advertiser spend and the lapping of the first ever revenue decline in our Ads business last year due to COVID.
In the second quarter, retail, again, was by far the largest contributor to the year-on-year growth of our Ads business. Travel, financial services and media and entertainment were also strong contributors.
Let's now take a few minutes to talk about the trends we've seen across our business. Over the last 18 months, we've been deeply focused on helping businesses, big and small, navigate profound change.
First, as a lifeline during the pandemic, and now, as a partner to reaccelerate growth as the world begins to reopen. The road to global recovery is likely to be uneven and unpredictable. That's why the real-time insights we've put in the hands of businesses going into the pandemic will be just as important coming out of it.
New tools like Travel Insights, which launched in the US this month after rolling out to select countries in APAC and EMEA in December, are helping our partners get a clearer picture of where demand is coming from.
Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, for example, is leaning into insights and automation across Search, display and YouTube to meet travelers wherever and whenever they need a hotel. They drove nearly two times more direct bookings from media deployed on Google in the first half of 2021 versus the year prior.
Or take Amtrak. COVID hit, ridership plummeted, budgets were cut. Uncertainty ensued on how to efficiently reach essential travelers. So we stepped in with insights and automation. Bookings for the last quarter, which was Q2, increased three times year-over-year, with cost per acquisition down 52%.
These examples also underscore the value of AI and automation in a world that's changing fast. We know today that more than 80% of our advertisers use automated bidding. Using ML, our Ads products are more efficiently connecting businesses with their customers, taking the guesswork out of getting the right message at the right time to the right customer, all in the privacy-first way.
And Performance Max, our news AI-powered [ph] campaign is now in beta. It lets brands buy ads from a single campaign across all Google properties, helping drive more online sales, more leads and or more store visits. Early results for participating advertisers are great.
Moving on to retail, where momentum remains strong. We're continuing to build an open ecosystem that benefits both users and merchants. Last year, we removed financial barriers with three product listings and zero commission fees. This year, we're removing integration barriers. With Shopify, WooCommerce, GoDaddy and Square, merchants can now onboard and show their products across Google for free. And our shopping graph is using AI to connect these products to the people who want them, with over 24 billion listings from millions of merchants across the web.
Let's talk omnichannel. Last quarter, I said it was here to stay, and it is. Retailers continue to build their digital presence to drive both online and offline sales. And we're helping them do it.
Take Bed, Bath & Beyond, who quickly pivoted to curbside pickup, pick up in-store and same-day delivery when people were stuck at home. They've continued these offerings across Google with impressive success. Omni and digital shoppers now make up 50% of customers. And in Q1, a third of total digital sales were fulfilled by stores, plus they've tapped YouTube to build awareness for their new customer-inspired owned brands. We'll continue to invest in new ways to help retailers through what is likely to be a long and uncertain recovery around the world.
Let's move to YouTube, which had a great quarter with strong growth in both brand and direct response. We've seen three key trends. First, brand. YouTube is helping advertisers reach audiences they can't find anywhere else. According to Nielsen's total ad ratings reach reporting, from Q4 '18 to Q4 '20, on average, 70% of YouTube's reach was delivered to an audience not reached by the advertisers TV media.
In other words, YouTube's reach is becoming increasingly incremental to TV, and this audience dynamic is a huge win for brands. In fact, Nielsen found that US advertisers who shifted just 20% of spend from TV to YouTube generated a 25% increase to the total campaign reach within their target audience while lowering their cost per reach point by almost 20%. These combined effects of approved reach and efficiency are helping advertisers get the most out of their brand investments.
Second, direct response. Advertisers are turning to the platform to generate demand and drive transactions. Like Malaysian Ed-Tech platform Mindvalley, which focuses on personal growth and learning, increased their investment in TrueView for Action, and now, Video Action as people turn to YouTube in record numbers to learn. In Q2, this generated 600,000 plus leads, with 20% coming from the US.
Third, YouTube is uniquely positioned to drive both massive reach and action. We're seeing more advertisers adopt a full funnel approach to scale their businesses with increased efficiency.
Compara, a financial services market leader in Chile, combined a reach and direct response campaign to capitalize on leads. Over 10 weeks, they reached 5 million users with incremental conversions up 70%. This trend is widely embraced by our largest advertisers, where business are breaking down silos between online and offline.
Since our founding, we've always believed that the future of Google and the future of our partners are intrinsically linked, from individual YouTube creators and major music labels, to global and local online publishers, to play developers, big and small. Our business is built on revenue share models that succeed only when our partners succeed.
One excellent example of how we're helping our partners innovate is our work with the telecom industry. Sundar talked about efforts in cloud to help them build more efficient networks and transition to 5G.
We're also working across Google to help carriers, including AT&T, Telstra, T-Mobile and Verizon, launch new devices and services, add new subscribers, rethink [ph] customer engagement via business messaging partnerships and support enterprise growth.
I want to close with two huge thank yous. First, to our customers and partners for their collaboration. Second, to our product, partnership sales and many support teams for their extraordinary work this quarter and dedication to our customers and partner success. Now over to Ruth. Thank you, Philipp. Our strong revenue performance in the second quarter reflects lapping the impact of COVID on our business, elevated consumer online activity, broad-based strength in advertiser spend, as well as the benefit of excellent ongoing execution by our teams.
My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter, unless I state otherwise. We'll start with results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results, and conclude with our outlook.
For the second quarter, our consolidated revenues were $61.9 billion, up 62%, or up 57% in constant currency. Our total cost of revenue was $26.2 billion, up 41%, primarily driven by growth in TAC, which was $10.9 billion, up 63%, followed by growth in other cost of revenues, which was $15.3 billion, up 29%, the largest driver of which was content acquisition costs.
Operating expenses were $16.3 billion, up 22%. In terms of the three component parts of OpEx, first, the increase in R&D expenses was driven primarily by headcount growth.
Second, the growth in sales and marketing expenses was due primarily to the ramp-up of spending on ads and promo in contrast to the pullback in the second quarter last year. Finally, the increase in G&A reflects the impact of charges relating to legal matters.
Headcount was up 4,061 from the first quarter. Operating income was $19.4 billion, up 203%, and our operating margin in the quarter was 31%. Other income and expense was $2.6 billion, which primarily reflects unrealized gains in the value of investments in equity securities. Net income was $18.5 billion.
Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with our Google Services segment. Total Google Services revenues were $57.1 billion, up 63%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $35.8 billion in the quarter were up 68%, with broad-based strength across our business, led again by strong growth in retail.
YouTube advertising revenues of $7 billion were up 84%, driven by brand, followed by direct response. Network advertising revenues of $7.6 billion were up 60%, driven by Ad Manager and AdMob. Other revenues were $6.6 billion, up 29%, primarily driven by growth in YouTube non-advertising revenues, followed by hardware, which benefited from the addition of Fitbit revenues. And finally, Google Play, which lapped the increased level of user engagement that started in Q1 last year due to the pandemic. Google Services operating income was $22.3 billion, up 134%, and the operating margin was 39%.
Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $4.6 billion for the second quarter, up 54%. GCP's revenue growth was again above Cloud overall, reflecting significant growth in both infrastructure and platform services.
Once again, strong growth in Google Workspace revenues was driven by robust growth in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had an operating loss of $591 million. As to our Other Bets in the first quarter, revenues were $192 million, the operating loss was $1.4 billion.
Let me close with some comments on our outlook. In the second quarter, revenues benefited from an FX tailwind of more than 4% at the consolidated level. Based on FX spot rates against the dollar relative to the third quarter of last year, we expect a more muted tailwind to revenues in the third quarter.
In terms of outlook by segment, for Google Services, the benefit to revenue growth in Q2 from lapping the effect of COVID last year will diminish through the balance of the year as we begin to lap stronger performance in the second half of 2020.
In the second quarter, we continued to benefit from elevated consumer online activity and broad-based strength in advertiser spend. We believe it is still too early to forecast the longer term trends as markets reopen, especially given the recent increase in COVID cases globally.
Within other revenues, Play revenue growth for the balance of the year will face headwinds due to the impact of lapping elevated engagement in the pandemic, as well as the change in fee structure, which was implemented as of July 1. We continue to invest across Google services to support the extraordinary opportunities we see.
A couple of reminders consistent with prior years, we expect that headcount additions will be seasonally higher in Q3 as we bring on new graduates. In addition, we expect sales and marketing expenses to be more heavily weighted to the back half of the year, in part, to support product launches in the holiday season.
As for Google Cloud, we remain focused on revenue growth and are pleased with the trends we are seeing. Across Cloud, we will continue to invest aggressively, given the opportunity we see.
Turning to CapEx. The results in the second quarter primarily reflect ongoing investment in our technical infrastructure, most notably in servers, to support ongoing growth across Google. We also began to increase the pace of investment in ground up construction and fit outs of office facilities, which were slowed due to COVID and are focused now on advances [Technical Difficulty]
Turning to cash and capital allocation. We continue to generate strong free cash flow of $16.4 billion in the quarter and $58.5 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the second quarter with $136 billion in cash and marketable securities.
As we indicated in our press release today, our Board has approved an amendment to the existing $50 billion stock repurchase program permitting us to repurchase both Class A and Class C shares in a manner that's in the best interest of the company and its stockholders.
Thank you. And now, Sundar, Philipp and I will take your questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Thanks for taking my question. I have two. One for Sundar and one for Philipp. Sundar, the first one is you've had so much innovation over the years using AI to improve Search and improve the overall business. Can you just give us some examples of where you still see low hanging fruit or areas for further improvement in the company's overall products using AI, et cetera, over the next couple of years?
And then, Philipp, your comments on omnichannel were pretty loud and clear. Give us some examples of where you're most focus to continue to enable more retailers to move in the omnichannel sort of drive that side of the business? Thanks. Brian, thanks. You know, a couple. We see so much headroom given our bet on AI, going to our most important product of all, Search. When you see the launch of Bird, which was a significant improvement, and we are following that up with MUM, which is another extraordinary advance. So the rate information is growing, pretty rapidly. And so constantly developing better models to improve our search quality ranking, et cetera, is one of the most important ways we invest.
Beyond that, I would say, all the work we are doing into making sure computers can understand in a multimodal way, be it images, audio, text, video, and then bringing it across our products, I think, is an important way we'll approach it. Philipp? Yes. And to my part of the question, look, we want to make sure that when people come to Google, they are able to basically find the best products and prices available from, frankly, the widest possible range of merchants. And we're making strong progress under Bill's leadership.
And as I said earlier, 2020 was about removing financial barriers. We made listings free, removed commission fees. And it's worth pointing out the upside of combining free listings with shopping ads actually. Merchants that used both in Q1 saw a 50% lift in clicks once they started, I think that's pretty impressive.
2021, as I said, has been about removing integration barriers. We have the partnerships with Shopify, Square, BigCommerce, GoDaddy, WooCommerce and so on. And they're making it easier for businesses to get started with us, whether it's across Search and Shopping and image search and YouTube.
And then once merchants are onboarded, I mean, there's so much more value we can offer them. We launched a new measurement tools to help retailers better understand performance and pricing. You asked specifically a question about focus areas.
And then we're making the product and user experience better, not only with our UI/UX research feedback with our tech and AI capabilities. And maybe a cool example is how we're using AR to bring in-store experiences online, like with auto dealerships, and then letting users really try before they buy. And we do this in cosmetics and in apparel categories. And we have the shopping graph, which I mentioned earlier. We think it will open up completely new product experiences across Google.
Shopping with Lens is one example. You can shop your screen shots or use your phone camera to find the dress or pair of sneakers that caught your eye or whatever. And we're working hard to build an open retail ecosystem, and that really levels the playing field for all merchants, and we think there is a lot of opportunity ahead. And I think those are our biggest areas of focus. Great. Thank you, both. Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Great. Thanks for taking the question. I have two. First, just I think the key initiative over the last couple of years has been to bring the full breadth of Google Services to customers. So I was hoping you could talk more just about - when you think about the Search and overall ads recovery, and then also growth in Google Cloud, how those efforts are going as you work across businesses with corporate customers and what their reception has been?
And then, Ruth, just on costs kind of in the back half and going forward, as you think about bringing some of these costs back, just curious if you can comment more around some of the puts and takes as you think about the overall cost structure pre COVID versus post COVID? Thanks. Yeah. Thanks, Doug. I would say, overall, as you realize, it's a broad digital shift, customers are looking for digital transformation. And depending on the sector they are in, they look to Alphabet as a digital partner, and we try to bring the broader solution set that's possible across our capabilities, and that's been working well.
You mentioned Cloud, most of our Cloud customers are either in conversations with us. It could be because they're concerned about security on their supply chain or they're trying to understand the shift to digital and invest more in data analytics. Or the shift to hybrid workforce is what's probably getting them to think about Workspace and so on.
And if they are retailers, we can bring in our expertise across ads, the work we are doing on commerce to be - with the partnerships we have, and so we can bring those additional expertise to bear.
And so that's a trend we are seeing across. Philipp gave examples of our telco partnerships. And so across our priority verticals, we are able to engage in a broad way. And maybe the recent Google-wide partnership with Univision was another example of a multiyear, multi-product partnership with companies. And with respect to the second question, how we think about investments in the back half. Really, the driving focus is how do we support near term, long term quality growth. And I think it's important to note that some of our costs are less variable in the short term, such as depreciation and the operations cost of our data centers.
So when you look at Q2 performance, in part, the meaningful year-on-year improvement in the operating margin in the second quarter, clearly reflects the strong revenue growth, but also the fact that some of these costs are less variable in the short term.
However, to support long term growth, and very much to your question, it's true across both Google Services and Google Cloud, we will continue to increase the pace of investment. And that's true in headcount, it's true with compute, sales and marketing, really across the board.
And you also heard that in some of my comments about CapEx. We're continuing to pick up the pace of investment in office facilities. Both fit outs and ground up construction have been slowed as a result of COVID, and we're pleased that the pace has picked up, and that really relates to our comments about continuing to build out across the US, around the globe, in line with continuing to invest in headcount growth.
I'd make one other point, which is, I think you're aware of this, but in this quarter, the results also reflect the benefit from the change in useful lives that we talked about earlier in the year that reduced depreciation expense. It's a benefit of about $721 million in the quarter, and the benefit from this change will be lower in the second half as you're looking ahead. Great. Thank you, Sundar and Ruth. Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America. Your line is open. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple, when you look at Search in the quarter, it really accelerated beyond the comp. And if you look at it quarter-over-quarter, it was really good.
So wondering if there's any products or verticals that really surprised you, or things to call out. And how do you think about the sustainability here, specifically in Search and the product pipeline from here?
And then secondly, on Cloud, really saw a nice margin improvement there. How do you feel about where you are on the infrastructure side and ability to really continue to show kind of that improvement in margins over time? Thank you. Two questions, maybe I'll take the second first. On the Cloud side, first of all, we do investments in our infrastructure. First of all, we are doing it across a set of cloud services we are building for Google. And it's the same that we bring to Cloud, and so there's tremendous synergies we have there.
And maybe to give you an example of it, I already mentioned data analytics and processing. It's the same infrastructure, be it BigQuery, et cetera, which we have invested and built over time. And people are looking to use data analytics alongside with machine learning and AI. They want to do this across structure and unstructured data, do it across any platform. And so that's the kind of capability we are able to bring. And overall, I'll let Ruth comment on maybe the margin side of this a bit more. Ruth? Yeah. I would just build on Sundar's comment. There's really no change in our approach to building the Cloud business. We do intend to continue to invest meaningfully. We are very pleased with the business, as we both said.
As an example, we're continuing to build out the global footprint, continuing to invest in our compute capacity globally. As an example, we most recently announced a second cloud region in India. This is our 26th cloud data center region globally. And so continuing to invest across the board, given the opportunity that we see.
And as I said last quarter, I would not extrapolate from quarter-to-quarter, given we still are in the early stages of building the business, and we do intend to continue to invest aggressively, including expanding our go to market organization, our channel expansion, our product offerings and our compute capacity. Excited about what we're seeing the team executing upon here. On Search, to answer the first part of your... Yeah, can you hear me? Yeah. Yeah. And to the first part of the question, similar to what I said in my remarks at the beginning, retail was again, by far the largest contributor to the year-on-year growth of our ads business. Travel, financial services, media entertainment were also very, very strong contributors. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Baird. Your line is open. Thanks for taking my questions. First, Sundar, as a follow-up on Cloud, you talked about the tailwinds from advanced AI and data analytics in terms of growth. Is it fair to say as well based on your initial comments that security also represents some competitive differentiation that's contributing incrementally to business development?
And then for Philipp, in the momentum in YouTube and capturing the shift in viewership and advertising away from linear TV, how do the different Google Services fit together in that? Not just core YouTube, but Android TV, Google TV, YouTube TV. Is this something that's been increasingly connected or linked in the back end and as well on the front end for consumers? Thanks. On security and cloud, we definitely see it as a strong differentiation. Obviously, Google for a long time. We are cloud native. We pioneered approaches like Zero Trust, built the architecture out from a security first perspective.
And so particularly over the course of the last couple of years, as companies have really - with the recent attacks, they really started thinking deeply about the vulnerabilities, supply chain security has been a major source of consensus, particularly over the past few quarters. Cyber threats, increasingly, is in the mind of not just CIOs, but CEOs across our partners.
And so it's definitely an area where we are seeing a lot of conversations, a lot of interest. It's our strongest product portfolio, and we are continuing to enhance our solutions, be it integrating Chronicle, BeyondCorp and all the product components we have there. So a definite source of strength and you'll continue to see us invest here. And on the second part of your question, look, momentum is really strong across both our brand and direct response business on YouTube. Maybe let me start on the brand side. The global shift to online video and streaming continues, with over like 2 billion monthly active users now, 1 billion plus hours of video watched every day. I think we're at the forefront of this shift.
And advertisers have increasingly needed to look beyond linear TV alternatives to achieve their reach and awareness goals. And as I said earlier, Nielsen total ad ratings reach reporting has found, on average, 70% of YouTube's reach was delivered to an audience, not reached by the advertisers TV media. So not only are we driving improved reach, but we're also helping brands do it more efficiently.
And as a result of this, you see many advertisers re-evaluating the media mix and increasing their investments in our platforms. And as far as the direct response part goes, we're helping advertisers convert intent into action. We try to drive performance at an incredible scale.
Take an example like with video action campaigns, which is our next-generation TrueView for Action format. Advertisers are getting access to even more inventory across YouTube and our partners, all in a single automated campaign. And as I said before, we're working really hard to make YouTube not only more actionable, but also more shoppable.
So YouTube is proving to be meaningful for not just brand building and reaching a massive audience, but also for converting viewers into buyers. And what's nice is that we're seeing more advertisers leveraging brand to create demand and direct response to convert it. So they're basically using the funnel very, very smartly.
And then to the second part of your second question, the YouTube TV ads, for example. This part, we're really trying to bring the - well, connected TV is - let me phrase it from a connected TV part. I think that's easier.
It is really the fastest growing consumer service that we have. And that growth started before the pandemic and has frankly solidified since. And in the US, we have over 120 million people watch YouTube on TVs every month, and that's up from like 100 million last year. We're number one in reach and watch time among ad-supported streaming services. So we're very, very happy with the development that we're seeing here. Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is open. Thanks. Just a follow-up on YouTube. Can you maybe talk to the e-commerce opportunity that you're seeing evolve? Where you're at now, and eventually, where would you like to be? Thank you. On YouTube, look, I mean, if you look at the engagement across the platform, we definitely see a lot of headroom for e-commerce. Over the past year, you've seen us really focus on ads rating a shift to - in terms of onboarding merchants across Google. So we have definitely invested both in terms of bringing merchants on board, removing barriers there, providing better integrations by partnering with players, platform providers across the industry. And now we are investing in our consumer experiences, be it on Google Search or on YouTube. And so you will see us roll out features over time. Philipp, do you want to add more here? Yeah. Look, there's a ton of commercial intent across YouTube, and it was a shopping destination before COVID. I mean, think un-boxing videos, product reviews, make up tutorials and so on. And throughout the pandemic, we've really seen more shoppers turn to the platform for ideas, inspiration and really help them decide what to buy.
And a number of shopping capabilities' already underway, and we're working really hard to make it easier for users to discover and buy directly on YouTube. And I mentioned how a merchant can globally add their product feeds now right into video action campaigns, and brands and shoppers alike are loving it, and we've also done beta testing this, for example, with Discovery Ads.
And last quarter, I mentioned how viewers can make purchases from their favorite creators via early experiments with brand connect and shop with product shelves, and early adopters are seeing a lot of success here. So stay tuned for more updates later this year. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Thanks. We've had record new business formation in the US, and I think globally in the wake of COVID. And my guess is that, that's also been a major driver of growth for you. Could you just talk about that a little bit to the extent to which you think some of these, especially the advertising trends, come from these new businesses that are formed, whether they're digital hybrid or whatever?
And then secondly, how do you go from tens of thousands of Waymo rides to millions of rides? Like what are the biggest obstacles to that? Any clue at all as to how long that takes, are the issues more regulatory, more technical? Thank you. Look, new businesses, small businesses are the backbone of our economy here. But obviously, local communities are in varying stages of recovery. Some are reopening, while others are, unfortunately, returning to lockdown. And we're focused on continuing to, I would say, level the playing field for SMBs here. And from getting them online and, frankly, set up for success, you're giving them all the digital tools they need to get discovered and be ready for what's ahead. This includes the ability to like seamlessly transition between online and offline and reach customers nearby, far beyond their local neighborhoods as well.
So over the past few months, I mean, literally, just the past few months, we've made it easier for SMBs to show their products across Google for free, and we added new ways for them to highlight in-store inventory through local inventory ads. And we've also made it easier for them to leverage the power of YouTube. They now can create video ad campaigns literally within minutes via their smartphone.
And these are just a few examples of the ways we're helping. Plus, also interesting trend, people are more eager than ever to support their local small businesses. Searches for support local business are up like 20x last year in the US alone. And this is creating a lot of opportunity for SMBs overall.
And I don't know, take an example, like Ayla Beauty [ph] for example, it's a San Francisco beauty brand. They made 100% pivot to online during the pandemic. And with insight into popular wellness and beauty searches and Google Ads, has been really able to grow their business significantly over the last year. On Waymo, as you mentioned, in our - in Phoenix, we've had very good experience by scaling up rides. These are driverless rides and no one else in the car other than the passengers, and people have had a very positive experience overall. We are obviously with a strong focus on safety. We're looking to scale it up.
Through it all, we are building newer capabilities as well investing in next-generation of hardware and software. So it's an iterative process, and at each step, it's very clear to us that we are ahead, and we are making progress, and you'll see us continue to invest here, with a focus on safety first, and I expect this to scale up more through the course of 2022. Thank you, Sundar. Thank you, Philipp. Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. Great, thanks. I have one for you, Sundar, and one for Philipp. Just a minute ago, Philipp spoke to the acceleration in streaming and smart TVs worldwide and the importance that YouTube has on the TV glass.
I wanted to hear from you about your interest in supporting the smart TV ecosystem? And where do you see the opportunity for Google in terms of your product offerings to maybe improve consumer adoption of connected TVs?
And then for you, Philipp, people have been asking about Search. But if you look at Search on a 2 year stack, the growth is the highest it has been years. And I wonder if you can disaggregate for us the growth between maybe new sort customers coming on the platform versus increased spending on an existing per customer basis? Anything you help us on kind of what drove it on a client-by-client basis on Search? You know, on the first question on the smart TV ecosystem. Look, I mean, there is a shift to these becoming computing devices over time. They are going to be connected computing experiences. People who both consume content passively, actively, including gaming, over the top video and so on.
So we view this as part of our platform shift. Android TV has made tremendous strides. It's a very customizable platform. We are working not only with TV providers globally, we are doing it with cable box manufacturers, as well as we supplement it with Google TV, with Chromecast as well.
So it's a significant investment from our side, making sure we can drive that shift. And obviously, it has a lot of synergies for us in terms of being able to bring our services to our users, as well as give more opportunities for our Play developers to reach more users as well. But definite strong integration points with YouTube and YouTube TV as well. Look, maybe rather than go into the deep dis-aggregation that you're talking about. Let me maybe talk a little about how we think about the overall market for Search. In the addressable market, in the last call - last quarter, I gave you a little bit of a breakdown here.
But what is really important is we're not just addressing above the line marketing budgets, which is different metrics around, let's say, around $0.5 trillion [ph] which is traditional advertising, TV advertising and so on. There is also significant upside in below the line budgets overall, like promotional pricing, product within sponsorships and so on.
And sure, we've seen COVID accelerate the shift to e-commerce at an astounding rate, but keep also in mind, 80% of commerce still remains offline. So there's a lot of room for digital to play a bigger role, and we think we can tap into other budgets that were traditionally used for, let's say, local advertising to drive sales.
And as we think about our long runway for growth, we also think obviously about improving user and advertiser experiences for years to come here. And we're constantly asking ourselves how do we drive better answers to queries, including those with commercial intent. And how do we use our ML to deliver even more relevant and higher quality experiences for users.
And our primary focus is really on delivering great experience for users and driving incremental value for our partners and making them successful. And I think as long as we do this, we should continue to see budgets move our way. Okay. Thank you, both. Thank you. Our last question comes from Jason Bazinet with Citi. Your line is open. Thanks. I just had one question, maybe it dovetails off of what you just said. But if I take your ad dollars this quarter, $50 billion in annualized, it's like $200 billion a year. Are you or the Board focused at all on trying to diversify away from the ad market? Or do you just feel like there's so much runway that there is no real reason to stay focused on non ad-based growth? Look, at a high level, we - multiple parts to your question. Obviously, we are very focused on - we have a mission. We have an approach of being helpful across certain important attributes. And we do deep investments in computer science and AI to build services.
And out of that, naturally, there is diversification over time. When you look at YouTube, is contributing to that. You look at Cloud, and within Cloud, we have both GCP and Workspace contributing to that. And longer term, we have efforts like Waymo as well.
Beyond that, as both Philipp and Ruth have spoken about, with this digital shift, we see a lot of headroom in terms of where market for either advertising or e-commerce, and so we see a lot of headroom there as well.
So we take a long-term view. We start from first principles to its focusing on both investing in deep technology and solving user problems. And out of that, I think you have a set of diversified models that emerged, both different types of businesses.
And also within a business, for example, in YouTube, we have both ads and subscription over time. And so I think we'll continue approaching it that way with an eye for the long term. Thank you. Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any further remarks. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter 2021 call. Thank you, and have a good evening. Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's conference call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].
I'd now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler and Ruth Porat.
Now I'll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations and financial performance, including the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on those areas, may be considered forward-looking, and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.
For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC including our upcoming Form 10-K filing for the year ended December 31, 2021.
During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor.
And now I'll turn the call over to Sundar. Thank you, Jim, and Happy New Year, everyone. The last few months have been challenging for communities everywhere because of Omicron. I'm grateful for the frontline healthcare workers who are helping us through it and glad to see signs that this wave is receding in many parts of the world. Whether it's helping people find a COVID testing center, learn a new skill or launch a new business, our mission to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant today as it's ever been.
In 2022, we'll stay focused on evolving our knowledge and information products, including Search, Maps and YouTube, to be even more helpful. Investments in AI will be key, and we'll continue to make improvements to conversational interfaces like the Assistant.
I'll begin by touching on a few highlights from Q4. Our new AI models are helping to create information experiences that are truly conversational, multimodal and personal. For example, Multitask Unified Model, or MUM for short, has improved searches for vaccine information. And soon, we'll introduce new ways to search with images and words simultaneously.
In October, we introduced a new AI architecture called Pathways. AI models are typically trained to do only one thing. With Pathways, a single model can be trained to do thousands, even millions of things. From MUM to Pathways to BERT and more, these deep AI investments are helping us lead in Search quality. They're also powering innovations beyond Search.
For example, DeepMind's protein folding system AlphaFold was recently recognized by Nature & Science Magazine as a defining breakthrough. To illustrate the scale of the team's achievement, it took scientists more than 50 years to figure out the structure of 150,000 proteins. The DeepMind team has now expanded that number to 1 million, and they think they will get to more than 100 million this year.
Philipp will talk in great detail about our advertising business, which also benefits from our investments in AI. It's been a very strong quarter for us. Our teams have helped millions of businesses of all sizes and launched dozens of important features to help them get the most out of their online marketing spend. These businesses are the backbone of our global economy and the heart of our community. So helping them thrive is more important than ever.
We are also seeing exciting momentum at YouTube. YouTube Shorts continues to drive significant engagement. We just hit 5 trillion all-time views and have over 15 billion views each day globally. This is helping our creator community reach newer and bigger audiences. In fact, more people are creating content on YouTube than ever before.
Last year, the number of YouTube channels that made at least $10,000 in revenue was up more than 40% year-over-year, and we are continuing to improve support for artists and creators. More creatives than ever are earning money from our non-ads products like Super Chat and channel memberships and the Shorts Fund is now available in more than 100 countries.
Another big area for investment is combining the best of AI software and hardware to deliver helpful experiences across our family of devices. In Q4, we set an all-time quarterly sales record for Pixel. This came in spite of an extremely challenging supply chain environment. The response to Pixel 6 from our customers and carrier partners was incredibly positive. And AI is making Pixel even more helpful. As one example, Live Translate detects whether a chat message is in a different language and automatically translates it in up to 48 languages.
We are also focused on ensuring devices across the Android and Chrome ecosystems work well together. For example, at CES last month, we announced that we are working with Acer, HP and Intel to bring great experiences to their devices. Also announced at CES, the new Ripple open standard will broaden the capabilities of radar technology opening the door for new products and services.
Another priority is ensuring our products and services are private, secure and safe. To that end, I'll note a new privacy sandbox proposal called Topics API. We think it will be a big improvement for protecting user privacy while also ensuring businesses are able to thrive online. We'll begin testing this year and look forward to feedback from the industry.
Next, on to Cloud. It's been a big year, so let me go a bit deeper this quarter. In Q4, Cloud revenue grew 45% year-over-year to $5.5 billion. Alphabet's backlog increased more than 70% to $51 billion, most of which is attributed to Google Cloud. This growth comes from many leading businesses including Albertsons and LVMH; digital natives including Box and Spotify; and public sector agencies including the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the Defense Innovation Unit and the USDA.
Our sales force, which we have more than tripled since 2019, delivered strong results across geographies, products and industries, and we continue to invest. For the full year 2021, compared with the full year 2020, we saw over 80% growth in total deal volume for Google Cloud Platform and over 65% growth in the number of deals over $1 billion.
Our partner ecosystem is helping accelerate our growth. For the full year 2021 compared with the full year 2020, the number of customers spending more than $1 million through the marketplace increased by 6x. Customer spend through channel partners on GCP more than doubled, and the number of active certifications within our top global systems integrators more than doubled as well.
Our product leadership continues with more than 2,000 new cloud products and feature releases in the last year. These were in four categories. First, our data cloud and our AI/ML platform is helping organizations like Cartier, Groupe Rocher and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries understand and use their data intelligently across multiple clouds. Our fast secure data sharing capability helps the National Cancer Institute advance breast cancer research. Our unified data lake and data warehouse, which brings together unstructured and structured data helps TELUS and Tyson Foods improve their understanding of customers. And our AI/ML platform helps CN deliver better customer experience.
Second, our open multi-cloud infrastructure enables customers like BBVA and Wells Fargo to run mission-critical systems on our cloud. We believe new auto scaling in our Kubernetes engine, which allows customers to run 15,000 node clusters outscales the competition by up to 10 times. Our edge cloud helps us grow in telecommunications, driving partnerships in Q4 with Indosat Oridu-Hurchison, Telenor and Verizon. They join existing customers and partners, including Ericsson, Reliance Jio and Nokia.
Third, our cybersecurity products are helping product organizations like ANZ Bank, Meditech and Wayfair as a trusted cloud provider. VirusTotal helps product organizations from software supply chain vulnerabilities. Chronicle and Security Command Center help organizations detect and protect themselves from cyber threats. And our fraud prevention and identity verification solutions are protecting over 5 million websites.
Finally, our secure communication and collaboration platform, Google Workspace is helping public sector organizations like USAID and the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory as well as global brands, including Colgate and Roche, adopt secure hybrid work. Our new Work Safer program launched in Q4 provides the highest security for e-mail meetings and documents by bringing together Google Workspace, Titan security keys, zero trust and other security advances.
Customers come to Google Cloud because of our expertise in bringing enterprises and consumer ecosystems closer together. One example is Shopify. From Black Friday through Cyber Monday, Shopify reported $6.3 billion in global sales by 47 million customers, all safely transacted on Google Cloud. Importantly, we have made progress operating 24/7 on carbon-free energy and continue to provide customers the cleanest cloud in the industry.
On to our Other Bets. October marked the one-year anniversary of our Waymo One fully autonomous commercial ride-hailing service in Arizona. In San Francisco, hundreds of riders are using Waymo One as part of our trusted tester program, but many more on the waiting list. And Waymo Via continues delivering freight into the Southwest U.S. and developing partnerships with key industry players.
Before I close, I want to say how proud I am of Google’s work to help economic recovery around the world. Nearly a third of small business owners say that without digital tools, they would have had to close their business during the pandemic. Digital skills have also been a lifeline to help people find jobs and grow their carriers. Since 2014, we have provided digital skill training to over 90 million people around the world. In the months and years ahead, technology will help unleash new opportunities globally, especially as hundreds of millions more people come online in places, including Southeast Asia and Africa.
With that, let me thank Googlers everywhere for their contributions this quarter and throughout 2021. Over to you, Philipp. Thanks, Sundar. Hi, everyone. It’s great to be here today. We’re pleased with the growth in Google Services revenues in the fourth quarter. Year-on-year performance was driven by broad-based strength in advertiser spend and strong consumer online activity. In the fourth quarter, retail was again by far the largest contributor to year-on-year growth of our ads business. Finance, media and entertainment and travel were also strong contributors.
Before we dive into some of the trends that drove this quarter’s performance, let’s zoom out for a second. Quarter after quarter, for the last 20-some months, we said that the world is in flux, that the recovery is uneven, that uncertainty is the new normal. Q4 proved no different. What we know for certain though is that businesses are the lifeblood of a thriving economy, and our role in helping them remains more important than ever.
AI continues to power our ability to help via Insights, new tools and automation. In fact, the same cutting-edge AI that’s advancing our understanding of everything from search to protein-folding is also driving innovation across our ads products.
Let’s start with automation. It’s become a key differentiator for businesses in navigating complexity and efficiently reaching customers, wherever they are in a privacy-first wave. Our news campaign, Performance Max, went global in November and has been quickly embraced by advertisers. It brings the best of Google Ads, AI and automation together to let brands promote their businesses across all Google services from a single campaign, helping them drive more online sales, leads and/or foot traffic. It’s also an example of how we are radically simplifying our products and making them easier for customers to use.
French children’s wear retailer Petit Bateau tested PMax over a three-week period, return on ad spend jumped 35%, click-through rates increased 40%, and valuable insights were gleaned into what messaging resonated most. We’ve also developed our Insights tools. Four new features launched in Q4, including demand forecast, which uses ML to help businesses predict forward-looking trends and better understand what goods to stock and what services to offer when.
Whether it’s insights, automation or new features, our work to help businesses more easily connect with their customers has been nonstop. On top of the 100-plus enhancements made to our ads products every quarter, we’ve launched 200-plus features and tools since March 2020. A recent example. We made it easier for businesses to claim and verify their business profile on Google Search and Maps and respond to customer messages directly in search. In Germany, completed business profiles received an average of over 5 times more calls versus those that aren’t. For an SMB, that can be really meaningful.
Let’s transition to retail, where we had a terrific quarter. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we’ve seen ongoing shifts in consumer spending patterns. Pre-COVID, each year, we saw increased spikes in demand between Black Friday and Cyber Monday. What’s interesting is that in 2020, and again in 2021, we actually saw shoppers start shopping earlier and spending more throughout the quarter. In Q4, we also saw a parallel lead year-over-year retail query growth with hobbies and leisure close second.
I’ve said it before, I’ll say it again, the future of retail is omnichannel. And we continue to invest in new features and next-gen experiences so merchants and shoppers can benefit. Global searches for gift shops near me jumped 60% year-over-year in October, with searches for gifts near me up 70% in Google Maps. People increasingly want to know what’s available nearby before they get to the store. Our new in-stock filter helps with just that. Shoppers can find local stores that carry the products they want right from search, like a new tennis racket or that last-minute birthday gift. Showing in-store availability helps businesses attract local customers, and they’ve caught on. One in four local offers across shopping and Google.com are taking advantage of our curbside pickup badge.
People also want deals. They’re looking for value. For shoppers, we made it possible to browse and discover the hottest deals for major moments like Black Friday and Cyber Monday on Search. For merchants, we made it even easier to list promotions via automated imports from third-party integrations like Shopify and WooCommerce. Moving inventory, attracting new customers and building brand loyalty during the holidays and beyond got a lot easier. In Q4, the number of merchants using promo features jumped 280% year-over-year.
Retailers are also turning to us to help them transform and accelerate growth. Take Warby Parker, who drove a 32% year-over-year increase in its Q3 sales by not only opening stores and expanding its contact lens business, but also by tapping into Google across surfaces. Omnichannel bidding, smart shopping campaigns and an expanded presence in Maps to promote in-store eye exams contributed to Warby’s success and it since launched its first-ever brand awareness campaign on YouTube, which brings me to YouTube, where our commerce opportunity remains really exciting.
We’re making it easier for viewers to buy what they see and simpler for advertisers to drive action with innovative solutions like product feeds and video action campaigns and emerging formats like live commerce. Backcountry.com generated a 12:1 return on ad spend with product feeds in 2021 and plans to double its investment in 2022, while Samsung, Walmart and Verizon partnered with creators to host shoppable holiday livestream events in the U.S.
As for our brand business, momentum remains strong. We continue to make inroads in unlocking TV brand budgets, and we’re still in the early innings of what’s possible with Connected TV.
Let’s take a minute to double-click into the full funnel trend I talked about last quarter. YouTube’s ability to drive both massive reach and action is becoming more clear to more advertisers. In a recent study, DR advertisers who added YouTube branding formats not only drove increased reach, but also averaged 9% more conversions. At the same time, we see more brand advertisers adding action, like Nike Korea, which saw higher conversion rates and drove 50% plus incremental reach by adding video action. Another huge focus for us is continuing to deliver for our partners and key ecosystems, all while delighting users.
Our expanded partnership with Snap to deliver a first of its kind quick tap to Snap feature is a great example. Our Pixel 4A with 5G or newer pixel phones users can access Snapchat directly from their lock screen, making Pixel the fastest phone to make a snap. And then across our Pixel and AR teams, we’re working with the NBA to create exciting immersive experiences for fans using 3D and AR technology. And the lighting doesn’t stop there. With Adobe, we are collaborating on a multiyear journey to bring Photoshop, Illustrator and its other flagship products to the web, a testament to the web as a first-class platform for creativity and productivity.
As we close out another extraordinary and challenging year, I want to express deep gratitude to our customers and partners for their trust and collaboration. Our success is only possible because of their success. I also want to say a gigantic thank you to our product, engineering, partnerships, sales and many support teams for their outstanding work and unwavering commitment to helping our users, customers and partners.
Ruth, over to you. Thank you, Philipp. We are very pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year, which reflected broad-based strength in advertiser spend and strong consumer online activity as well as substantial ongoing revenue growth from Google Cloud. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the fourth quarter, unless I state otherwise. We will start with results at the Alphabet level followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook.
For the fourth quarter, our consolidated revenues were $75.3 billion, up 32% or up 33% in constant currency, rounding out a strong year. Our total cost of revenues was $33 billion, up 26%, primarily driven by other cost of revenues, which was $19.6 billion, up 25%. The biggest factors here were: first, content acquisition costs, primarily driven by costs for YouTube’s advertising-supported content followed by costs for subscription content; second, hardware costs; and third, costs associated with data centers and other operations, including depreciation, which were offset in part by the impact of the change in useful lives made at the beginning of 2021.
Operating expenses were $20.5 billion, up 35%. In terms of the three component parts of OpEx: first, the increase in R&D expenses was driven primarily by headcount growth; second, the growth in sales and marketing expenses was driven primarily by increased spending on ads and promo for the 2021 holiday season, in contrast to the sizable pullback in the fourth quarter of 2020; finally, the increase in G&A reflects the impact of charges relating to legal matters as well as charitable contributions.
Operating income was $21.9 billion, up 40%, and our operating margin was 29%. Other income and expense was $2.5 billion, which primarily reflects unrealized gains in the value of investments in equity securities. Net income was $20.6 billion. We continue to generate strong free cash flow with $18.6 billion in the quarter and $67 billion in 2021. We ended the year with $140 billion in cash and marketable securities. We also repurchased a total of $50 billion of our shares in 2021.
Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with our Google Services segment. Total Google Services revenues were $69.4 billion, up 31%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $43.3 billion in the quarter were up 36%, with broad-based strength across our business, led again by strong growth in retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $8.6 billion were up 25%, reflecting strength in both direct response and brand advertising. The deceleration in the growth rate versus the third quarter of 2021 was driven primarily by lapping a strong recovery in brand in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Network advertising revenues of $9.3 billion were up 26%, driven by AdMob. Other revenues were $8.2 billion, up 22%, driven primarily by growth in hardware, which benefited from the successful launch of the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro as well as the addition of Fitbit revenues followed by YouTube non-advertising revenues.
In terms of Google Services cost, TAC was $13.4 billion, up 28%. Google Services operating income was $26 billion, up 36%. And the operating margin was 37%.
Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $5.5 billion for the fourth quarter, up 45%. GCP’s revenue growth was again greater than Clouds, and that reflects significant growth in both infrastructure and platform services. Strong revenue growth in Google Workspace was driven by solid growth in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had an operating loss of $890 million. As to our Other Bets for the full year 2021, revenues were $753 million. The operating loss was $5.3 billion for the full year 2021 versus an operating loss of $4.5 billion in 2020.
Let me close with some comments on our outlook. We are nearly two years into a global pandemic that has brought unprecedented change and uncertainty in the macro environment. Throughout these difficult times, Googlers have remained focused on delivering helpful services for users and partners as well as on driving innovation for long-term growth.
In terms of outlook by segment, for Google Services, we are very pleased with our year-on-year revenue growth in Q4 and for the full year 2021, which continued to be driven by broad-based advertiser strength and strong consumer online activity. The year-on-year growth rate also reflected a benefit from lapping COVID-related weakness in 2020, which obviously will not be a factor in 2022.
Within other revenues, we are pleased with the momentum from Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro reflected in our hardware revenues in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, hardware revenues in 2021 also reflected the acquisition of Fitbit, which we lapped a couple of weeks ago.
With respect to Play, the underlying consumer spend and engagement trends remained healthy in the fourth quarter. That being said, in 2022, Google Play’s contribution to revenue growth will reflect the fee changes we started to implement in the third quarter of 2021. In terms of investment levels within Google Services, we are focused investing meaningfully in the many opportunities we see for growth.
Turning to Google Cloud, 2021 represented another year of substantial growth. Our investments in our go-to-market organization, product innovation and partner ecosystem have been paying off as we help customers with their digital transformation. You can see that Google Cloud revenues increased by 47% for the full year 2021 compared to 2020 with GCP revenues continuing to grow at a faster rate than cloud overall.
While Cloud operating loss and operating margin improved in 2021, we plan to continue to invest aggressively in Cloud given the sizable market opportunity we see. We do remain focused on the longer-term path to profitability and over time, operating loss and operating margin should benefit from increased scale.
At the Alphabet level, in the first quarter, based on current spot rates, we expect the foreign exchange impact on reported revenues to be a headwind. With respect to Alphabet headcount, we added nearly 6,500 people in the fourth quarter, and the majority of hires were for technical roles. We continue to attract great talent and expect a strong pace of hiring in 2022 across Alphabet.
Turning to CapEx. The results in the fourth quarter primarily reflect ongoing investment in our technical infrastructure, most notably in servers, to support ongoing growth in both Google Services and Google Cloud. We also increased the pace of investment in fit-outs and ground-up construction of office facilities. In 2022, we expect a meaningful increase in CapEx. In technical infrastructure, servers will again be the largest driver of spend. With respect to office facilities, after fairly muted CapEx over the past two years, we are reaccelerating investment in fit-outs and ground-up construction.
Recently, you have also seen us pursue real estate acquisitions where they make sense. For example, last month, we announced plans to purchase for $1 billion of previously leased headquarters building in London. And in the first quarter, we have completed the $2.1 billion purchase of a New York office building that we announced in the third quarter of 2021.
Thank you. And now Sundar, Philipp and I will take your questions. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. Thanks for taking the questions. One for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar, first was just curious to get your view on Web3 and just how you’re thinking about Alphabet’s approach and where your primary efforts here may lie going forward? And then, Ruth, you mentioned the 6,500 increase in head count. I think it was the biggest that we’ve seen in any quarter ever. I know you’re catching up on hiring from the last several quarters. But can you just help us understand little bit more on where these investments are going in tech and how to think about the cost structure in ’22? Thanks. Thanks. Look, any time there is innovation, I find it exciting, and I think it is something we want to support the best we can. The web has always evolved, and it’s going to continue to evolve. And as Google, we have benefited tremendously from open-source technologies, and so we do plan to contribute there. There’s several areas of interest, AR is a big one at the computing layer. We’ve been investing there for a long time and will continue to play a role. And it’s something both not just at the computing layer, the services layer, be it Maps, YouTube, Google Meet, et cetera, I think, will contribute a lot.
On Web3, we are definitely looking at blockchain and such an interesting and powerful technology with broad applications, so much broader again in any one application. So as a company, we are looking at how we might contribute to the ecosystem and add value. Just one example, our Cloud team is looking at how they can support our customers’ needs in building, transacting, storing value and deploying new products on blockchain-based platform. So we’ll definitely be watching the space closely and supporting it where we can. Overall, I think technology will continue to evolve and innovate, and we want to be pro-innovation and approach it that way. And in terms of headcount, we do continue to be a magnet for great talent. The number of applications is up year-on-year. And as I said, as you noted, we added almost 6,500 people in the fourth quarter. We do expect the strong pace to continue. And it really goes to comments from Sundar, from Philipp and from me. We’re excited about the opportunities ahead of us in particular, Google Services, Google Cloud, we’re adding. We intend to ensure we have the scale that we need to execute well. And so we’re continuing to hire, as I said. The majority were again in technical roles and really pleased with the opportunities we see ahead. Thank you. And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Thanks so much. Maybe two questions, if I can. First, following up on Doug’s question. Susan has been writing a fair bit on YouTube and the way it’s exposed to the creator economy and what you’re trying to build for the medium to long term. Can you talk about elements of the creator economy and how it sort of fits into your products, both on the advertising side and the commerce side over the medium to long term?
And then, Ruth, maybe just one follow-up on the expense side. Was there anything of a onetime nature in Q4? Because just looking at some of the corporate expense or some of the elements of the core margin, just trying to make sure if there were any onetimers that needed to be called out because I think you talked about legal and charitable donations as well just so we could model that right. Thank you. On YouTube, look, one of the -- YouTube from day one, it’s been very focused on making sure we can support creators while it’s been a big part. And even recently, I mentioned in my remarks earlier about the growth we are seeing not just in ads, but beyond ads, with Super Chat, channel memberships and so on. Susan mentioned in her creator letter that -- while early, they’ll be taking a look at NFT and so on, with the view towards making sure the user experience works and -- but there is value, we are constantly thinking about how we can support and do more for creators. So that’s going to be an integral part.
I think all the commerce experiences we are thinking about in YouTube is a whole additional layer of opportunity. And again, it’s another area where it all feels very early to me. We are seeing tremendous traction in YouTube across newer areas, be it podcast, gaming, learning, sports. And so across all these areas, we’ll kind of take a vertical-specific look and see how we can support creators better. And then in terms of expense, I gave a number of the items. R&D was mostly an increase in headcount. In sales and marketing, I would note that sales and marketing was elevated in the fourth quarter by ads and promo, in part to support the holiday season and more so than last year. The additional items to note that I called out is in the fourth quarter, we did have a onetime well-being bonus. We also had a year-on-year increase in charitable contributions, including a higher Googler gift match. And in fact, I would say that it’s more helpful in particular on the corporate costs unallocated to think of that line on a trailing 12-month basis because it can be lumpy to your question. Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Maybe the first one for Philipp. You’ve made so much progress over the last 12 to 24 months about improving the retail and e-commerce Search product for advertisers. As you look across the other verticals of Search, where are you most excited or see the most opportunity for innovation to really drive more value for advertisers in nonretail verticals as we go into 2022?
Then the second question, either Philipp or Sundar, you both talked about the commerce shopping opportunity on YouTube. Can you just sort of talk to us a little bit about what aspects are already built out versus what areas of innovation or hurdles you still have to clear to really realize that commerce opportunity on YouTube? Thanks. Yes. Thank you so much for your question. Look, consumers now have a lot of different ways to access information and more than they’ve ever had before. And Search is just one of them. But we’re constantly trying to innovate and improve the experience for both users and advertisers over the long term. And as I’ve discussed previously, I can share some of the questions we actually ask ourselves to give you a sense of how we think about the opportunity. So the first one, obviously, are we the best place users turn when they need information or want to discover and be inspired. So things like queries and discover. And we’re focused on providing better and more comprehensive answers to more types of questions, and we need to obviously deliver high-quality relevant info for all types of queries, including ones where they may be looking for a specific brand or product or just look for an inspiration. And how people search is changing, and it needs to become more multimodal, more conversational. So what does that mean for ads, for example. So getting user experience right across commercial quarries is essential way beyond, obviously, the area that you mentioned. And there is a lot of innovation that goes into this.
The second part is really are we providing the most relevant ads when and where consumers are. And we only want to show ads when they’re helpful to people. On 80% of the searches actually, we show no top ads and most of the ads that you see are on searches with commercial intent. And yes, we’re -- for those with commercial interest, the question is really how do we provide the best answer in a way that’s meaningful to users and where advertisers actually have something relevant to offer.
And then the last, the third point is really the questions around -- and this goes again for the vertical you mentioned -- but for many, many beyond -- are we delivering most conversions for advertisers at the best ROI? And there’s a lot of intelligence in our auction to deliver great ROI for advertisers, but there’s always more we can do. And we’re delivering -- or are we delivering the most relevant users by leveraging our users’ signals? Are we building the best creatives by combining advertisers’ assets in ways that make it compelling for user? Have we predicted the value of the user for that advertiser so we can help appropriately bid for each search with a unique user and query combinations we need? Can we fully measure what users do after they click on ads, from buying something to making phone calls or downloading apps and all across devices? So those are a lot of different things how we think about the runway ahead. Maybe quickly on YouTube and commerce. Look, one thing I would say is across both Search, YouTube and other areas, there’s a lot of common infrastructure that’s getting done, right? So this is focused on merchants, onboarding merchants and all the back end so that we can have the broadest and the most comprehensive inventory available. And there, our partnership with other e-commerce platforms is a basic foundational layer we are putting in.
And specifically on YouTube, while pretty early, there’s a lot of pilots underway, just we have introduced a creative tagging pilot program so that we were had a choice to browse, learn and shop products featured in the favorite videos, piloted shopping live streams with brands like Walmart and Target and more broadly, including product feeds more globally in video action campaigns. So there’s a lot more to do. Super early also on testing how shopping can be integrated with Shorts. And so again, early, but I find the opportunity space here pretty broad, and it’s exciting. Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks. Maybe one for Sundar and one for Ruth. First, on Search, very strong growth. Just maybe you could help us understand where you are in kind of the AI cycle of improvements there. There’s still a lot of room to go there, you have highlighted in several earnings reports. And second, is there any fundamental reason why Search could be higher growth today than it was pre-pandemic?
And then over to Ruth, Cloud had impressive growth. I’m assuming the infrastructure layer is highest in the sector. And it grew 500 million plus quarter-over-quarter, but margins did come down. And so just kind of understanding what drove that? And then what it’s going to take to really show a good leverage there? Thank you. On the first part, we obviously are investing deeply in AI R&D across both Google AI and Deep line and -- and so -- and then we take that and apply it across the company, but particularly in the context of Search. And so that’s what underlies BERT, MUM, Pathways and LaMDA to power conversational experiences. And so, when I look at the tip of tree about -- as to where the research on the AI side is progressing, it’s progressing at an incredibly rapid pace. We are committed to leading there. And then we have real good interfaces between the AI teams and our core product area teams, including Search to kind of productize this.
So primarily, I think you’re going to continue to see us lead in search quality. I just find the world of information is only continuing to grow, and it’s getting increasingly multimodal in nature. Just like we took the leap from text to images, thinking through video, audio, incorporating it and then providing it back to users regardless of whether they are typing, speaking or looking at something wanting an answer. That’s the journey between AI and Search, and we’ll continue doing that. And in terms of Cloud, if we step back at the comments that both Sundar and I made, overall, we’re very pleased with the ongoing progress in the business, and that’s reflected in the revenue growth, as you noted, our backlog, the breadth of customer wins, the industry verticals. Our view is that we’re in an extraordinary time to help customers digitally transform their businesses. And the key thing is we believe it remains very early innings. So as a result, our focus remains on revenue growth and investing as needed as we’re looking over the long term. We’re continuing to invest aggressively. And it’s in our go-to-market capabilities. It’s our products. It’s our infrastructure. We do remain focused on the longer-term path to profitability, but we are continuing to invest here as we’re seeing early innings and pleased with the ongoing progress. Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Okay. I’ll try two questions. I just want to follow-up on Justin’s question about Search growing faster than pre-pandemic. I think, Philipp you talked about a couple of areas within search and retail is at the front of the list. I think you mentioned in a few other categories. Travel was always a big category. Do you feel like travel has come back full or is it -- travel is still sort of underperforming for macro reasons versus where it was pre-COVID?
And then, Ruth, just on the share repurchases, I think that was a record level in the quarter. How should we think about the share repurchases going forward? To what extent is it opportunistic versus, I don’t know, systematic or systemic way you think about returning cash to shareholders as every year, your free cash flow rises? Thank you. Yes. Thank you. Look, I said earlier that travel was a contributor to our year-on-year ads growth in Q4, and we were encouraged by the performance we saw throughout much of the quarter, but we found that user behavior tends to reflect what’s going on in the world. And demand really continues to vary based on location and type of activity. And this has been more pronounced in light of Omicron. We’ve seen changes in traveler search behavior as preferences have evolved such as searches for outdoor destinations like beaches, parks and camping have increased, while searches for museums, for example, have declined. Overall, I think it’s fair to say that travel has generally been sensitive to outbreaks and that there’s still unevenness that makes it too soon to say what trends are here to stay and which pre-pandemic habits are coming back.
That said, as people think about where they want to go next, they’re coming to us to help them navigate a patchwork of information. In fact, from the end of August to the end of October, searches for travel rules were up over 6 times globally year-over-year. And we’ve launched a ton of new features to make it easier for people to understand changing travel restrictions and requirements. Similarly for travel partners, we’ve pivoted our product strategy in big ways to help whether it’s with Flight Demand Explorer and Travel Insights to help partners predict demand over making it free for hotel and travel companies and now to an activity operators to list their booking links. And I’m sure you also saw our big sustainability in news in October, new info on CO2 and Google Flights, eco-friendly hotels, new eco-friendly routes and maps. So lots of important work is being done here actually to help our users and business drive more sustainable choices and just overall help our travel partners and the industry at large. In terms of the share repurchase, as we’ve talked about on prior calls, we do view the share repurchase program as valuable and are pleased that we were able to increase the authorization to $50 billion last year. You’ve seen that we’ve increased the pace quite a bit over the last several years from $18 billion back in 2019 to $50 billion, as I said, for the full year 2021 and are just continuing to execute against it. We do have additional capacity under the existing authorization and just are continuing to execute against it, do view it as incrementally valuable. Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open. Thanks. I have a couple, Sundar and Philipp. Sundar, I’m just interested in the decision you announced last week to move away from Federated Learning and go to Topics. So you could talk a bit about the reason and the rationale why you’re making that change. When FLoC was first announced, it was patterned to be very effective relative to cookies as a signal for advertisers. What do you think is going to be the impact as you go away from cookies to topics on ROAs and budgets? And then Philipp, I think during the pandemic, one of the big growth spurts has definitely been connected TV. Can you talk a bit about what YouTube is seeing with Connected TV and how important of a driver is that? And then as hopefully we get back to normal, what are you doing on the product side to make YouTube on CTV even more engaging as time goes on? Thanks. So I can take the one for Sundar. So the Chrome team has been really focused and working independently on Privacy Sandbox, which you all know is our initiative to build privacy preserving on device technologies that will power the future of digital advertising and obviously as a result of free and open web. And just last week, we announced our new Privacy Sandbox called Topics. And Topics was informed by our own learnings plus widespread, let me call it, community feedback from our earlier FLoC trials. It will now actually replace our FLoC proposal. I urge you all to read last week’s blog for the details. But basically, the Topics API will allow advertisers to show relevant ads to people based on their interest inferred from the website they visit all in a more private way for users.
And from an advertiser perspective, which is a big part of your question, it’s obviously way too early to share more because we’re just opening this up to the world. We expect to make it available for testing by the end of Q1, but we’re really focused on designing for both parties from an advertiser and a privacy point of view and are committed to making sure goals are met on both sides.
On the second one, the connected TV opportunity, streaming in the living room has exploded. We’ve seen it firsthand. Connected TV is our fastest-growing screen, and we think there’s a ton of runway ahead. Brands are getting the best of all worlds, the precision of digital with the scale of linear and a lot more relevance. They can personalize ads at scale and use video ad sequencing to tell powerful stories and we’ve recently added action to the mix. Video action campaigns were upgraded in October to automatically include CTV inventory, which means users get a more helpful viewing experience and brands get to drive more online sales and/or leads.
And just think about it like the traditional TV screen “desk screen” that viewers have essentially stared at for decades, is now starting to come alive with the ability to drive conversions and it’s pretty cool. Measurement is also obviously a key component to success here, and we want to make sure that advertisers can fully measure their YouTube CTV video investments across YouTube and YouTube TV for an accurate view of true incremental reach and frequency and so on. And the U.S. advertisers actually can do this now, if you have Comscore and Nielsen. So all-in-all, we are excited by the opportunities ahead with Connected TV. I think we’re just getting started. Thank you. And our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Ruth, it sounds like there was a good Q4 ad flush, the concept that, spend it, if you got it. And I’m just curious about seasonality this year and if you expect the year to be more back-end loaded? Or do you feel like it’s a little more balanced as we go through this year? So overall, we did see strength as we’re going through the year. As I indicated, there was a broad-based advertiser strength. There was strong consumer online activity, and those were really the primary drivers. I think the one place that that comment might be more relevant is really in understanding the year-on-year within YouTube relative to last year, where there was strength. This year relative to -- there was real strength this year, but what we saw last year was more in line with, I think, your question, which was after a week beginning of the year, a very strong fourth quarter. Last year, we were lapping that very strong quarter last year. And so that explains some of the year-on-year growth comparisons. But overall, the key driver was the backdrop of broad-based advertisers support and spending? Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Great. Good afternoon, everyone. I have two questions for Sundar. First, Sundar, you mentioned that investment in artificial intelligence has helped the ads business significantly. What are the two to three ways that you think AI has helped your advertisers invest your ad revenue growth the most?
And then second, we’ve seen a variety of new bills introduced in the U.S. Congress recently that seemed to take in squarely at large technology companies like Alphabet. What do you think that these bills have right? And what do you think that they have wrong? Thank you. So two things. On AI and advertising -- after I answer the second part, pass it to Philipp to give more details. But definitely, again, the overarching thing is the same AI advancements we want to make it simpler for advertisers to run campaigns, and there’s a lot that goes behind it to drive that simplicity. And Philipp can give a bit more details there.
On your question about Congressional antitrust bills. As a company, we have always been constructive in how we have approached and we are open to sensible updated regulations. It’s important that technology is beneficial to society. And so for example, there are many areas where there’s widespread agreement. We have call for privacy regulations, particularly at the federal level, updating productions for children and so on.
On some of the current proposals, they quite don’t address those issues. There are areas where we are genuinely concerned that they could break a wide range of popular services we offer to our users, all the work we do to make them -- make our products safe, private, secure, et cetera. And in some cases, can hurt American competitiveness by disadvantaging solely U.S. companies.
So broadly, when we think about building many features, do we have to think on each feature, we shipped 3,000 features in Search alone every year. How do we make sure that complies with all the regulation, where do we proactively need approvals and so on. So those all can have unintended consequences.
We’re very worried about the impact on small business and local retailers as well as their customers as well. Having said that, we are committed to approaching it constructively. We always want to engage and do things in a way that’s beneficial for society. And we have urged Congress to take time to consider the unintended consequences, and I think we’ll remain focused on building great products for our users. So back to the first question you asked on AI and the impact on our ads product. We cover -- Performance Max, we talked about it. We talked about Insights page. In Search, I would say we see an emergence of a real, let’s call it, a better together story fueled by machine learning and automation. Advertisers are leaning more into automation using responsive search ads to create and select the best performing creatives, matching with more relevant search queries using broad match keywords, setting optimized bids with auction-time signals. We have smart bidding. So those are a few examples.
We’re using more AI to help advertisers measure their results and bid intelligently with data-driven attribution, for example, which uses very advanced ML to more accurately understand how each marketing touch point actually contributed to a conversion obviously, while respecting user privacies, broad matched keywords are a big part of this. We have responsive ads on display and discovery. They use text image and video assets from advertisers and predict the best combination of assets to show in any size or format on Google properties or the display network. Yes, so I think AI and ML will only get better and so will our tools, and we’re helping advertisers lean into automation and identify new opportunities as a central part really of the recovery and growth strategies. That is more than two to three. So thank you, Philipp for that, and thank you, Sundar, for your comments as well. Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Okay. Thank you so much. I’ll stick to one. So zooming out a little bit on the big picture. Sundar, I think it was almost four years ago when Google released a block post about the next billion users and how developing products for India and other emerging markets will hopefully inform what you should be doing everywhere else. So I think you have previously talked about Tez being a pretty notable example there. So can you talk about whether we should continue to be looking overseas to think about what direction you might take across your various products and services? Thanks. Thanks, Stephen. Great question. And I think that trend is going to continue. You mentioned, obviously, payments. And definitely, it’s informed our payment strategy globally. In general, we are trying to think deeper about these newer markets, both -- it really lines up with our mission of building a more equitable Internet for everyone.
A couple of the things we have done recently. A year ago, we announced a $10 billion Google for India Digitization Fund. And it’s a reflection of our confidence in the future of India, its digital economy, our desire to build products there, which we think will help us globally. And last year in October 2021, we announced a plan to invest $1 billion in Africa, again, with the goal of supporting entrepreneurs, helping businesses with their digital transformation and beginning to build products in Africa for African users, which I think will help us take learnings outside.
I already see it. When I look at YouTube in India, some of the commerce ideas we talked about earlier, you may see us first stride in India first because we can get quicker feedback, very dynamic youthful population. And so we’ll do it there and then roll it out globally. So we are constantly looking for opportunities like that. Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I’d like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any closing remarks. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter 2022 call. Thank you and have a good evening. Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.","the fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call will be held in a listen-only mode . it will be a question-and-answer session, followed by a discussion session . a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's press release .",1.0

[Operator Instructions] I'd now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler and Ruth Porat.
Now I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations and financial performance may be considered forward-looking, and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor.
And now I'll turn the call over to Sundar. Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Over the last few months, guided by our mission, we continue to develop helpful technologies with a view towards empowering both people and businesses. Even as more people return to in-person activities, we are seeing hybrid approaches to learning and working are here to stay, and our products are helping partners seize these new opportunities.
To help support our own flexible work plans, this year, we plan to invest approximately $9.5 billion in our U.S. offices and data centers, creating at least 12,000 new Google jobs in the U.S. in places like New York and Atlanta. To enable our long-term growth, we are investing in areas like Cloud, AI, YouTube, Search and beyond. In 2020 and 2021 combined, we invested $40 billion in research and development here in the U.S. Beyond the U.S., we have announced new office investments in London and Warsaw and a new product development center in Nairobi. We are excited for the product development they will support. We'll share more about these investments at Google I/O, our annual developer conference on May 11, and I encourage you to tune in.
Turning now to product highlights. AI continues to be at the heart of our core search and information products. We launched multisearch in Google Search this quarter. It's a new way people can find what they need using both images and words. For example, you can snap a photo of a shirt pattern and then type the word green to find a green shirt with that pattern. We also shared new features in Search to help people find health care providers who take their insurance and book appointments online. With ads automation, search ads powered by AI are helping our customers quickly respond to the market conditions most relevant to their business. Philipp will discuss this in more detail.
Let's move to YouTube. We continue to support our community of creators, advertisers and viewers. With over 2 billion monthly signed-in users, we are well positioned to do this. YouTube, over the past 2 years, has seen significant growth and has become a central destination for entertainment, learning and educational content. And even as people have returned to in-person activities, time spent on YouTube has continued to grow. Just as YouTube evolve from desktop to mobile, and that created huge opportunities, we are excited about the new opportunities we see now. Short-form video is one. YouTube Shorts is now averaging over 30 billion daily views. That's 4x as much as a year ago. In the first quarter, we added new capabilities to video editing, and we are continuing to invest in making Shorts a fantastic experience for creators and viewers alike. As we've always done with products, we focus on building a great user experience first, and we will work to build monetization over time.
The living room is another area of opportunity. On average, viewers are watching over 700 million hours of YouTube content on televisions every day. And in the year ahead, we will give YouTube's connected TV viewers new smartphone control navigation and interactivity features, allowing people to comment and share content they are watching on television directly from their devices.
Turning next to our computing platforms. A few weeks ago, we marked a big milestone, our 100th release of Chrome and Chrome OS. Over the years, we have worked with developer and OEM partners to improve speed, simplicity and security and move the web forward. It's a great example of what we mean when we say we are building for the long term. And on Android, we'll showcase at I/O the many helpful features and services that Android and its platforms provide. Over the coming years, we will continue to invest in new form factors, seamless multidevice experiences and raising the bar for user privacy while giving developers the tools they need to succeed on mobile.
As you know, we have made changes to our Google Play pricing model to help all developers on our platform succeed. Today, 99% of developers qualify for a service fee of 15% or less. While this impacted our short-term results, we think it's the right long-term approach to support the ecosystem and to be the most developer-friendly app store and gaming platform available. We are also exploring alternative billing options. And as we do this, we'll continue to uphold high safety standards that protect personal data and sensitive financial information. Earlier today, we launched the Data safety section in Play, where people can access more information about how apps collect, share and secure their data.
In hardware, Pixel 6 is a huge step forward for the Pixel portfolio, and it's been great to see the response from Pixel users. It's the fastest-selling Pixel ever, and we are building broad consumer awareness of the brand and making good progress. I'm excited about the products we have coming and look forward to sharing more at Google I/O.
Next, on to Cloud, where Q1 revenue grew 44% year-over-year with continued strong performance across Google Cloud Platform and Workspace. We continue to deliver differentiated products across 4 distinct areas. First, cybersecurity, where we introduced new offerings, including Assured Workloads to address digital sovereignty in the European Union; Virtual Machine Threat Detection, a first-to-market agentless malware detection capability; an advanced intrusion detection system for network threat detection. Organizations like T-Mobile and DoorDash are protecting their critical systems and data with Google Cloud's trusted cybersecurity products. These include Security Command Center, which helps many companies, including UKG, Ultimate Kronos Group, and Ocado Group, monitor and manage their security posture and risk. Our leading threat detection and response platform, Chronicle, is now paired with Simplify to more quickly automate incident detection and resolution. We also announced our intent to acquire Mandiant, a leader in dynamic cyber defense and response, to help protect customers from the most advanced threats.
Second, we continue to evolve a leading data cloud with serverless Spark to run batch Spark workloads; BigLake, a new storage engine that unifies data warehouses and lakes; and Dataplex, which provides unified management and governance of data across data warehouses and lakes. Our unified data cloud and AI platform is helping organizations like KeyBanc, LG Electronics, and Macy's work intelligently with data across multiple clouds. BigQuery, our leading solution for analytics, is helping customers like Kraft Heinz, Mercado Libre and Vertabelo [ph] to help create more personal consumer experiences. BT Group, UPS and other leading brands continue to tap our deep expertise in artificial intelligence and machine learning to power their organizations. This includes our Contact Center AI platform, which helped The Home Depot improve their call containment by 185%, creating a more positive customer support experience. We are proud to share that more than 700 technology partners power their applications with our data cloud.
Third, our open secure infrastructure remains a differentiator as it enables customers to run their workloads and apps where they need them. This is winning global brands like Dun & Bradstreet, Boeing and Kyocera. Our product leadership continued with the release of Tau VMs, which powers price performance that's more than 40% better than any other leading cloud; and Google Distributed Cloud Edge, a new edge solution designed to run telecommunication networks at scale, which is helping Bell Canada evolve its 5G network. And we further expanded our regional footprint globally. Leading companies like Mahindra are choosing us for large-scale IT transformations and migrating their data centers to Google Cloud, while Sony's Crunchyroll uses our infrastructure and networking capabilities to power the largest anime streaming service in the world. Our scalability enables Ninja Van, the leading logistics provider in Southeast Asia, to handle more than 10x their normal traffic during peak times.
Finally, we continue to advance Google Workspace. To support hybrid work, we recently introduced new collaboration features, including bringing Google Meet directly into Google Docs, Sheets and Slides. You can now see and hear your team as you collaborate in real time without the need to schedule meetings. Google Meet can now live stream to up to 100,000 people who can also participate in Q&A and polls. We also launched the next wave of innovation in Google Docs with smart canvas, including auto-generated summaries and pageless format in Docs, smart chips and automating workflow using Gmail. Smart canvas has seen very rapid uptake with more than 6 million checklist and 6 million smart chips being added to documents each week. These innovations are helping employees adapt to hybrid work at large enterprises like Equifax and Ocean Network Express, digital natives including Flipkart and organizations like the University of Alberta.
Finally, our Other Bets. This month, Waymo became the first company to run fully autonomous ride-hailing operations in multiple locations simultaneously. Today, employees can take rider-only trips in San Francisco, joining the growing number of public Waymo One riders in Phoenix. Wing launched its on-demand drone deliveries in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. In the first quarter of 2022, Wing completed over 50,000 commercial deliveries. That's up more than 3x year-over-year. As you know, sustainability continues to be a big focus for us. In addition to our own ambitious goals to operate on 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030, we recently joined Frontier, a new coalition with Stripe and many others, jointly committing more than $900 million to accelerate carbon removal solutions.
Before I close, we remain deeply concerned about the war in Ukraine and the humanitarian crisis unfolding in the region. While I was in Warsaw, Poland last month, I met with many leaders across Central and Eastern Europe to reaffirm our commitment to the region. We are finding ways for our products and platforms to be helpful, including enhanced features on Search to help refugees find resources. Across all these efforts, I feel inspired by the ways that our teams at Google work to help people in moments big and small.
With that, let me thank Googlers everywhere for their contributions this quarter. Over to you, Philipp. Thanks, Sundar, and hi, everyone. As always, it's great to be with you all. I want to start by echoing Sundar. The war in Ukraine and the deepening humanitarian crisis across the region is heartbreaking. As with our response during the global pandemic, we remain focused on how we can help, whether it's air raid alerts on Android phones to help Ukranians get to safety, refugee centers live on Maps or new attributes that let hotels share if they're offering free or significantly discounted accommodations for those in need or whether it's helping via Insights, which enabled Ukraine's largest person-to-person marketplace, OLX Ukraine, to pivot its product strategy nearly overnight to help people find essential products and services.
Let's take a quick look at our performance this quarter before we dive into the trends that drove it. In Google Services revenues, we were pleased with the growth in the first quarter, up 20% year-over-year. Retail was again the largest contributor to year-on-year growth of our ads business in Q1, followed by travel.
Speaking of travel, people are seemingly back on the move, whether they're searching for planes, passports or their next vacation destination. Q1 travel searches were above Q1 '19 prepandemic levels. Query growth in categories like beaches and islands were up 27% versus 2019, while vacation rentals rose 37%. Compared to last year, global searches for passport online jumped 80%, while searches for travel insurance surged 2x. We continue to launch new tools to help travel partners reconnect with customers and to help users find the trusted info they need to plan their next trip.
In March, free hotel booking links expanded to Search and Maps. Travel partners can extend their reach. Users get a more comprehensive set of options. And earlier this month, we made it possible for hoteliers to easily share their rates and availability directly on Google via Business Profile.
Let's talk Performance Max, our newest AI-powered campaign that allows businesses to harness the best of automation to drive the most optimal performance across all Google Ads inventory. Since launching globally in November, PMax has seen strong customer adoption, particularly among smaller businesses. PMax' simplicity shows how we're moving from a model in which businesses needed to understand the complex language of campaigns, keywords, CPC and so on to a model where we understand the company's goals and actively help them achieve their business objectives.
Take ASSIST CARD, a leading LatAm travel assistance company who first tested PMax to accelerate its recovery in Argentina. Initial test to drive sales yielded a 40% lower cost per acquisition at a 15x higher conversion rate versus other campaigns with the same goals. Early success led ASSIST CARD to rapidly expand PMax to 9 other countries, including Brazil, Spain and the U.S., and significantly increased spend on the new format in 2022.
Moving on to retail, where we had another strong quarter. Consumers are finding a new balance between online and in-person. Google Maps searches for shopping near me were up 100% globally year-over-year. People want to buy from brands that provide a seamless experience wherever and whenever they prefer to shop. For local businesses and big box retailers alike, this remains a big opportunity. Omnichannel is still a winning strategy. We're also continuing our investments to make shopping on Google as effortless, delightful and as engaging as possible. With rich, more immersive content, including more visual and browsable results for apparel and fashion searches and new advancements like multisearch in Google Search, which launched in beta for shopping queries earlier this month, we're helping people go beyond the search box to search anywhere and any way.
Take AR beauty, which is still in its early days, but a great example of the innovative and cool experiences we're building to benefit both users and brands. Shoppers can now virtually discover and try on thousands of products from 90-plus brands, including Maybelline New York, MAC and Charlotte Tilbury as well as from retailers like Ulta Beauty right in Google Search.
Let's move on to YouTube. Our brand business had a strong quarter. However, we did see more modest growth in direct response. For brand, we're enthusiastic about what's ahead for connected TV. Brands are turning to us to tap into the shift to streaming and reach new audiences in smarter and more efficient ways. Over 135 million people in the U.S. were reached via YouTube on connected TVs in December. We've recently rolled out new tools to help advertisers consistently plan and measure their CTV spend across platforms. And later this year, in partnership with Nielsen, we'll help brands directly compare their YouTube reach to linear TV, including the ability to measure co-viewing. This apples-to-apples comparison will be a game changer in helping advertisers make smarter investment decisions.
According to Nielsen, in the U.S., YouTube accounts for over 50% of ad-supported streaming watch time on connected TVs among people ages 18 and up. And over 35% of viewers in this group can't be reached by any other ad-supported streaming service. In other words, we're seeing that when users choose to watch ad-supported CTV, they choose to watch YouTube, and YouTube delivers CTV audiences that advertisers can reach anywhere else. Brands are taking notice, like Warner Bros., who leaned to YouTube to help drive awareness among key audiences for The Batman. By using a combination of best-performing video creative, connected TV media and video ad sequencing, Warner Bros. expanded its target audience in the 2 weeks leading up to its release, helping contribute to its successful $134 million opening weekend. For direct response, we continue to believe there's great opportunity to address commercial intent on YouTube between video action campaigns, app campaigns, product feeds and new live commerce features.
As Sundar mentioned, Shorts is another area we're really excited about. Engagement is strong, and we're focused on delivering great experiences for users, creators and advertisers. In fact, we're testing ads on Shorts with products like app install and video action campaigns. And while it's still early days, we're encouraged by initial advertiser feedback and results, which brings me to our partners and how we're closely collaborating with them to grow and evolve healthier, sustainable ecosystems and bring them the best of Google. We continue to focus on accelerating growth in India's digital ecosystem and are excited about our expanding partnerships with a number of partners in the region.
Then Sundar mentioned Sony's Crunchyroll. Beyond Cloud, we're working across Android, Google Play, Google TV and more to help Sony and Crunchyroll acquire and retain more users and fans and strengthen its leadership in the direct-to-consumer anime streaming market. As always, I want to extend deep appreciation to our customers and partners for their collaboration and trust and to our product, engineering, partnership, sales and many support teams. Thank you. Your relentless focus on helping our users, customers and partners makes our success possible.
Now, over to Ruth. Thank you, Philipp. We had a strong first quarter with revenue growth led again by Search and Cloud. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter, unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook.
For the first quarter, our consolidated revenues were $68 billion, up 23% or up 26% in constant currency. Our total cost of revenues was $29.6 billion, up 23%, primarily driven by other cost of revenues, which was $17.6 billion, up 22%. The biggest factors here were costs associated with data centers and other operations, followed by content acquisition costs, primarily driven by costs for subscription content and then costs for YouTube's advertising-supported content.
Operating expenses were $18.3 billion, up 24%. Headcount growth was the primary driver of expense across all 3 categories: research and development, sales and marketing and G&A. Growth in sales and marketing also reflects an increase in advertising and promo expense as we ramped back from the lower levels of spend last year. Operating income was $20.1 billion, up 22%. And our operating margin was 30%. Other income and expense was a loss of $1.2 billion, which was driven by unrealized losses in the value of investments in equity securities given market volatility. Net income was $16.4 billion. We again delivered substantial free cash flow with $15.3 billion in the quarter and $69 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with $134 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repurchased a total of 52 billion of our Class A and Class C shares in the last 12 months.
Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with our Google Services segment. Total Google Services revenues were $61.5 billion, up 20%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $39.6 billion in the quarter were up 24%, led again by retail, followed by continued recovery in travel. YouTube advertising revenues of $6.9 billion were up 14%, reflecting ongoing strong growth in brand and more modest growth in direct response. The deceleration in the year-on-year growth rate primarily reflects lapping of the exceptional performance of direct response that we called out in the first quarter of 2021.
Network advertising revenues of $8.2 billion were up 20%, driven by AdSense and AdMob. Other revenues were $6.8 billion, up 5%. The growth rate reflects substantial growth in YouTube non-advertising revenues driven by subscriber growth in YouTube Music and Premium and YouTube TV, which were largely offset by a year-on-year decline in Play revenues, primarily as a result of the pricing changes that we've discussed with you previously. In terms of costs within Google Services, TAC was $12 billion, up 23%. Google Services operating income was $22.9 billion, up 17%. And the operating margin was 37%.
Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $5.8 billion for the first quarter, up 44%. GCP's revenue growth was again greater than Cloud's, reflecting significant growth in both infrastructure and platform services. Strong revenue growth in Google Workspace was driven by solid growth in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had an operating loss of $931 million. As to our Other Bets for the first quarter, revenues were $440 million, and the operating loss was $1.2 billion.
Let me close with some comments on our outlook. We're pleased with our strong results in the first quarter, which reflect the benefit of investments we've made over many years. We remain committed to investing to continue to build helpful technologies in support of long-term growth notwithstanding the uncertainty in the global outlook. The most visible reflection of our focus on long-term performance is our continued investment in talent and compute capacity across the company. In terms of outlook by segment for Google Services, the revenue growth rates we delivered in 2021 in our advertising businesses benefited from lapping the COVID-related weakness in 2020. Obviously, we will not have that tailwind for the rest of this year. As discussed in prior calls, the largest impact from COVID on our results was in the second quarter of 2020, which means that in the second quarter of 2022, we will face a particularly tough comp as we lap the recovery we had in the second quarter of 2021. Additionally, the second quarter results will continue to reflect that we suspended the vast majority of our commercial activities in Russia.
Within other revenues, in the first quarter, the substantial growth in YouTube subscription revenues was offset by a decline in Play revenues versus the first quarter last year due to the fee changes we previously announced. These fee changes will continue to affect our results throughout 2022 until we lap the introduction of the changes.
Turning to Google Cloud. Cloud's performance in the first quarter reflects growing deal volume and strength across multiple industries and regions. Customers are increasingly choosing Google Cloud to help them digitally transform their businesses using our global infrastructure offerings, our data analytics and AI capabilities and the collaboration benefits of Workspace. We continue to invest aggressively in Cloud given the sizable market opportunity we see.
At the Alphabet level, reported revenues in the first quarter reflect that the U.S. dollar strengthened versus last year, with a 3-point headwind in Q1 compared with a 2-point tailwind in the first quarter of 2021. In the second quarter, the impact from foreign exchange rates will have an even greater impact on year-over-year comparisons given both the larger tailwind last year and the increase we expect in the headwind in Q2 versus Q1 based on current spot rates. With respect to Alphabet headcount, we added 7,400 people in the first quarter, and the majority of hires were for technical roles. The biggest increases in headcount this quarter across product areas were again in Cloud for both technical and sales roles.
Turning to CapEx. The investment in the first quarter reflects the timing of closing for several large acquisitions of office facilities, which converged in the first quarter. More specifically, of the total, nearly 4 billion covers the purchases in New York, London and Poland that we had mentioned previously. We continue to expect a meaningful increase in CapEx in 2022 versus last year. For the balance of 2022, the increase will be particularly reflected in investments in technical infrastructure globally with servers as the largest component. As stated in our press release today, our Board has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $70 billion of our Class A and Class C shares in a manner that's in the best interest of the company and its stockholders.
Thank you. And now Sundar, Philipp and I will take your questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. I have two. The first one, Ruth, wondering, could you talk to us at all about sort of the shape of the ad business growth throughout the first quarter, understanding there's some uncertainty around Ukraine, et cetera? And then what have you seen sort of quarter-to-date in the overall Search business from a growth perspective? And then the second one for Philipp. Appreciate all the color on Performance Max. Can you just talk to us a little bit about -- strategically about how long we should think about it takes to drive broader adoption of these type of tools with your sales forces at months, quarters, years? Where are you in SMB adoption? How long do you think it takes to get broader and maybe full adoption of a product like that? Thanks, Brian. So in terms of the ad business, I would say, as I did in the opening comments, we were very pleased with the year-on-year Search revenue growth in the first quarter, up 24%. And it really reflected the strength that we've seen in retail, as Philipp and I commented on. I would say -- as you're asking how are we looking forward, I would say the revenue growth rates that we delivered in 2021 in Search and across our advertising businesses more generally, as I said in the opening comments, did benefit from lapping the COVID-related weakness in 2020. So I think one key point is that we're not going to have that tailwind for the rest of this year. And as I noted, one of the key areas to focus is Q2 of 2020. That was where we had the largest impact from COVID. So that means in the second quarter of 2022, we're going to face a tough comp, as I said.
I would say, in addition, the second quarter results are going to continue to reflect that we suspended the vast majority of our commercial activities in Russia. And then I noted the impact of foreign exchange. So as we're looking at it generally, we feel good about what we're doing in the business, a couple of key points that I called out there. And to your question on Performance Max, which we covered last quarter as well, maybe just a quick recap. It really brings together the best of Google's automation to help advertisers maximize their reach and efficiency across our channels. Using the same input, we can now serve campaigns on multiple inventory formats, expanding an advertisers' reach with the same effort. And by the way, just today, we announced new features for Performance Max, including new customer acquisition goals, new campaign level insights. More details about the one-click upgrade tool for Smart Shopping and Local campaigns. So we're very, very committed to helping Performance Max deliver for our advertisers and have been very open to advertiser feedback how we can do this.
And specifically on your time axis, I don't think there is a material difference to the time axis that we've looked at in previous rollouts. As always, focused on generating the maximum value and performance for our advertising partners. And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs. Maybe one follow-up to Brian's question. Other industry players have called out pockets of weakness in brand advertising globally in the quarter that you just reported. Did you see any of that from a volatility standpoint, especially around maybe the war in Ukraine for a period of time in March? And then sticking with all the commentary you gave on YouTube, how should we be thinking about the strategic goals of driving longer engagement and user growth and monetization for you to begin some of the initiatives you called out versus how to think about the performance of the business as we go through '22, short-form video versus long-form video or maybe mix of direct response versus brand advertising? Great. So I'll start on the first question and revenue impact. I think you are asking from the war and anything else that was relevant there. I would say the most important, as both Sundar and Philipp said, is what a tragic humanitarian crisis this is. And across Google, we're doing a lot to provide support. In terms of revenues, the most direct impact is the fact that we suspended the vast majority of our commercial activities in Russia, as we announced in early March. And to your question, about 1% of Google revenues were from Russia in 2021, and that was primarily from advertising. In addition, from the outset of the war, there was a pullback in advertiser spend, particularly on YouTube in Europe. So a couple of impacts from the war.
And I guess over to Philipp with respect to YouTube and trends there. So maybe to dig a little deeper into the part of your questions around Shorts. Shorts went global, rolled out to over 100 countries, and as Sundar mentioned, now has 30 billion daily views, which is 4x higher than a year ago. And if we take the creator view, we're taking a fresh look at what it means to monetize Shorts and reward creators for their short-term videos. The first step, I think, is our $100 million YouTube Shorts Fund, which is now available in over 100 countries globally. And over 40% of creators who will receive payment from the Shorts Funds in 2021 weren't in the YouTube Partner Program, just as an interesting number. And then on the advertiser view side, as I mentioned earlier, we're testing ads on Shorts with products like app install and Video action campaigns and are encouraged by the early results. And so all in all, I think we're deeply committed to supporting the next generation of mobile creators here on YouTube and are very actively working on what monetization could look like in the future. And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. I have two. First, just on advertising. Just thinking about industry conversations, it seems pretty clear that you were able to capture some dollars that shifted to search from social related to Apple's iOS privacy changes. Just curious if that dynamic continued in 1Q. And then if you can comment at all on just how you think about sustainability of those dollars going forward. And then, Ruth, in terms of spending and on the margin side, operating margins continue to be strong at 30% even with the greater headcount of the past couple of quarters. Just hoping you could elaborate a little bit on what you mean by considered investments and in what areas are you able to offset and gain more efficiencies in the business. Thanks for the questions. So with respect to Search and ATT, there's really nothing to highlight. We haven't seen a noticeable shift in spend. And then in terms of overall margins and how we're thinking about investing, what I tried to make clear is we do continue to plan to invest aggressively this year. I made that point in opening comments with respect to both ongoing hiring at a rapid clip as well as ongoing investment in technical infrastructure. And I would say in terms of margins, we do remain focused on investing for long-term value creation. And as we noted, last year, in 2021, our margins did benefit from substantial revenue growth, while at the same time, expense growth ramped more gradually during the year. And in certain respects, as we talked about last year, margins benefited from what I described as a bit of a timing difference between revenue growth and expense growth.
And there were 2 other benefits worth calling out that we talked about last year that affected operating margin. The first was the impact from the change in useful lives that we called out last year, and that benefited the year-on-year growth in expenses last year. And the second was the impact of foreign exchange, which was a tailwind last year, but as I noted, has really flipped to a headwind given the strength of the U.S. dollar. And as a reminder, the impact of foreign exchange is greater on operating income than it is on revenue given our expense base is weighted towards the U.S. with most of our R&D efforts located here in the U.S. So the main thing is, the key point, we are very focused on long-term value creation. And in our view, given the opportunities we see, there are some key investments that we're continuing to make. And our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. A couple of things. First on YouTube, quite a ramp in Shorts activity. Has that been a little bit of a headwind for growth as you ramp that up, and we can try to guess on monetization later? And then secondly, when you think about regulation in Europe, there's a lot of headlines about the Digital Market Act and other things. How do you think about the regulatory environment and the evolution over the next couple of years? Thanks for the questions. So in terms of YouTube, I think there are a couple of questions in your question. In terms of the deceleration in the year-on-year revenue growth rate relative to the first quarter, the largest factor was lapping an exceptionally strong quarter in direct response, as we noted last year. In addition to that direct response lapping, there were a couple of other items worth noting. First, as I've already mentioned, the war that did have an outsized impact on YouTube ads relative to the rest of Google. And that was both from suspending the vast majority of our commercial activities in Russia as well as, as I noted earlier, the related reduction in spend primarily by brand advertisers in Europe. Then in addition, as we mentioned on the third quarter earnings call, we continue to experience a headwind from ATT primarily in direct response. And the dollar impact from ATT has been consistent since it was implemented in April of last year. And then there's the FX headwind I've already commented on.
I would say to the other part of your question, we're experiencing a slight headwind to revenue growth as Shorts viewership grows as a percentage of total YouTube time. We are testing monetization on Shorts, and early advertiser feedback and results are encouraging. And the team is focused on closing the gap with traditional YouTube ads over time. So we're excited about the new opportunities with Shorts, but a slight headwind. On the second part of the question about DMA and -- regulation. Look, we support a number of DMA's goals, including expanded consumer choice, interoperability. Obviously, the implementation deals will be important, and we are still -- it's too early to tell, but we'll be working as we have done over the past many years. We'll be engaging constructively, including regulatory dialogue, to understand and make progress. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from Evercore ISI. Okay. I'll stick, please, with YouTube questions. That kind of brand softness in Western Europe, Ruth, does that look like that has already abated? Or does that look like that's continuing? And if you step back and just look at overall YouTube usage -- and I know you mentioned some numbers in the prepared comments. Just given the much broader array now, I think, of content options, including in short-form video and long-form video, are you seeing the overall growth -- any impact on the overall growth in YouTube users or in engagement per YouTube user? So in terms of the first question, impact from the war, I think it's too early to comment. Tragically, it is still ongoing; so too early to comment there. And then overall, in terms of YouTube and engagement, I noted on both YouTube's advertising business as well as the subscription businesses, the performance there, I'd say, over the past few years, we've seen significant investment in online video. There's been a ton of innovation. We think innovation is positive. Broadly, we continue to benefit from the fact that there are 2 billion logged-in viewers who visit YouTube every single month. And people are creating comment -- content on YouTube at a very active rate. We're really pleased with what we see there, and our team does remain focused on innovating and helping creators grow.
As Sundar said, Shorts now has 30 billion daily views. That's 4x higher than a year ago. And I think that really goes to your question about the level of activity that we're seeing. And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. I have one on YouTube, of course, and then one for Ruth. On YouTube, I think what we're hearing is that there's emerging concern that TikTok is a competitor to YouTube's mobile position. And I know you called out the strength of Shorts, but can you talk big picture if you're seeing any meaningful shift in consumer demand to the mobile YouTube product? And any type of advertising maybe shift on mobile because of TikTok? And then to Ruth, it's an odd quarter because if you look at APAC, the APAC region underperformed EMEA, which had Russia and Ukraine in there. Is there anything you want to call out about Asia Pacific this quarter, why it could have been softer? Or any other product that may have led to a bit of a slower quarter for APAC? Look, maybe I'll start on the first part of your question. It's very similar to what Ruth said before. I mean we've seen significant investment in online video, and there's been a ton of innovation. But there are 2 billion plus logged-in viewers who visit YouTube every single month, and more people are creating content on YouTube than we've ever seen before. And the team remains very focused on trying to help creators grow, trying to innovate. And just to give you a number, 2021, the number of YouTube channels that had made at least $10,000 in revenue was up more than 40% year-over-year. And we're heavily investing in Shorts, in the connected TV and shopping. You heard the stats from Sundar on the 30 billion daily views. So we continue to invest and new monetization options for creators beyond ads are a big part of what we're doing. And as I said before, testing ads on Shorts are encouraged by initial results. Yes. In terms of geographic color, just to even broaden out your question a bit more and go through the various regions, so in the U.S., we were pleased with the 27% year-on-year growth. And I think nothing to call out there. In Europe, as you noted in your question, the slightly bigger impact from the war in Ukraine than in other regions, and then the sizable delta between fixed and floating really reflects the meaningful strengthening of the dollar versus the euro. I guess to the heart of your question with respect to APAC, the main thing there is to take you back to a year ago, we were lapping a substantial 39% growth rate in constant currency. And so this really reflects lapping that sizable growth relative to more muted ads performance in APAC this first quarter, and it really takes you just back to last quarter. In other -- Americas, it was much more about the FX headwind more than anything else. And our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. For Sundar, just on Google Cloud, if you could just walk through the next leg of growth, where you're most excited for the rest of '22. Thanks. Look, overall across the board, I'm excited because you saw in my earlier remarks there's a lot of product innovation across the key areas, be it data and analytics, cybersecurity, our open multicloud as well as Google Workspace. So when I look at the innovation in the product pipeline and the overall demand we are seeing and how early our journey is, there's definitely a lot to look forward to. Cybersecurity has been a particular focus. We obviously are excited about our acquisition of Mandiant, which I think will help us serve customers deeper as well. But overall, the execution has been great. We are scaling up, particularly in our go-to-market as well. And I think that will play out well. And over time, as we focus on converting bookings to consumption as well, I think it will play out well, taking a long-run view and methodically scaling up and executing better. So that's what I'm excited about. And our next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. So Sundar, I think your Search team recently released a block posting, talking about the desire to help your users with their management of money. And I think we talked about some of this last time with the rollout of Tez in India and the evolution to Google Pay, but can you talk about your ambitions to add more utility to the service so that it becomes more, hopefully, indispensable service for your user base and particularly as you hope that this theoretically becomes your next billion user product? Thanks, Stephen. Obviously, we've been focused on making sure payments works well. One, maybe you can step back and think about it as that our payment strategy is very similar to the strategy we have for commerce overall. We want to make all of this work easier, both on the merchant and the financial institution side, and making sure they can connect with the customers well. And you mentioned the work in India that was certainly what really got everything started. We are now -- 150 million people across 40 countries are using Google Pay. And your questions about making -- first of all, we're making sure it works across the board, works well, easy to use for all the sites. And then over time, we will innovate and build new digital experiences. Simple examples you saw was we rolled out the ability for users to pay for parking on Google Pay with their voice just using Google Assistant.
So really building for scale, building for simplicity. And then over time, we will layer on additional helpful features. But we are definitely focused on the first part now, making sure it works well for as many users across the world. And our last question comes from the line of Dan Salmon from BMO. I have 2 questions. First, I'd like to ask about Google Analytics, where there's been a transition ongoing for a year or so now to a new version of the product and where you'll begin sunsetting the older version next year. That's always a really important tool for advertisers and publishers to measure the impact of your advertising. So could you tell us a little bit more about those changes, how they may or may not be related to the deprecation of cookies in Chrome and how you plan to ensure its smooth transition? And then second, one last one on YouTube. You mentioned the strong performance in subscriptions, Ruth. Any products that you would highlight that are driving that strength in particular? So I can take the one on the Google Analytics side. This is something we've been working on for a very long time. There is no specific relation to what you've mentioned. This is one of the normal upgrades to our products that we're doing on a quite regular basis. We're very excited about it. Advertisers are excited about it. Our partners are happy about it. So this is -- yes, this is a nice one. We like it. And then in terms of the YouTube subscription businesses. As I said, they continue to deliver substantial revenue growth, and that was driven by subscriber growth for both YouTube TV as well as YouTube Music and Premium. So pleased with what we're seeing there. Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any closing remarks. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter 2022 call. Thank you, and have a good evening. Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.","a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release . this year, we plan to invest approximately $9.5 billion in our U.S. offices and data centers . in 2020 and 2021 combined, we invested $40 billion in research and development here in the united states .",0.0

And now, I’ll turn the call over to Sundar. Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone.
I’m proud of how our teams continue to build helpful products and experiences for people and partners. Reflecting this, our performance in Search in the second quarter was strong. We are also seeing momentum in Cloud.
With an uncertain global economic outlook, our strategy to invest in deep technology and computer science to build helpful products for the long term is the right one. Our ability to take the long view stems from our timeless mission, to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.
At Google I/O in May, I talked about two key ways we move that mission forward, advancing both knowledge and computing. Those goals are at the heart of what we do. We know that our services are particularly helpful to people and businesses during uncertain moments. Whether it’s using Search or YouTube to find anything from anywhere or highly efficient tools like Search Ads that help businesses of all sizes reach customers or Google Cloud, which helps companies adapt to hybrid work and find efficiencies.
We’ll continue to invest in areas like AI, Search and Cloud, and we’ll do it responsibly and in a way that is responsive to the current environment. Earlier this month, I announced that we’ll be slowing our hiring and sharpening our focus as a company. We are focused on hiring engineering, technical and other critical roles. And we are working to improve productivity and ensure that the great talent we do hire is aligned with our long-term priorities.
Turning now to product highlights. Years ago, we made a big bet on AI. We believe that it would be transformational for our business and for the world. We are still in the early days, yet AI already underpins many of our most helpful products and services.
For example, AI is helping us create entirely new ways to search. People are using Google Lens to do visual searches more than 8 billion times per month. A new feature called multisearch helps people find what they need using words and images at the same time.
Later this year, multisearch will be able to help people find local results near them. AI is also helping improve translation. With the new monolingual approach to translation, we’ve added 24 new languages to Google Translate, spoken by 300 million people. And a new immersive view in Maps uses computer vision, AI and billions of images to create high fidelity representations of places around the world.
Beyond AI, we are also seeing a new frontier with augmented reality. We have been testing exciting prototypes in our labs like the device we shared at I/O that puts real-time translation and transcription in your line of sight. It’s one example of how AR can solve real needs in the real world.
And last week, we announced that we will soon begin early testing of AR prototypes in real-world scenarios. Our goal is to learn how they can help people in their everyday lives. Our investments in commerce are another way we deliver helpful experiences. People are shopping across Google more than 1 billion times each day. We see hundreds of millions of shopping searches on Google Images each month.
Merchants will soon be able to submit 3D images of their products to appear directly on Google Search, so customers can try before they buy. We’re also focused on bringing together hardware, software and AI in a range of helpful devices.
At I/O announced great new products, including Pixel 6a, Pixel Buds Pro and Pixel Watch. We are currently taking preorders for Pixel 6a and Pixel Buds Pro. It’s been great to see the positive feedback so far.
And on platforms, I’m proud that Android remains the world’s most popular operating system with more than 3 billion monthly active devices worldwide. Last year alone, consumers activated 1 billion Android phones. We are making it easier for Android users to share photos and communicate with friends and family with a modern messaging standard called Rich Communication Services or RCS.
Across our platforms and beyond, we keep more people safe online than anyone else in the world. Safe browsing on Chrome browsers help protect billions of people every day by warning them when they try to access dangerous sites or files.
Earlier this year, we rolled out a new machine learning model that identifies more than twice as many potentially malicious sites and phishing attacks as the previous model, helping to contribute to a safer and more secure web.
We’ve also unified our password managers across Chrome and Android. Now stored passwords can be grouped and predicted across devices, apps and the web.
Taking a closer look at YouTube. YouTube Shorts are watched by over 1.5 billion signed-in users every month with more than 30 billion daily views. In Q2, YouTube TV surpassed 5 million subscribers, including trialers. There’s also a lot of potential for shopping on YouTube. Just last week, we announced a partnership with Shopify. It will help creators easily connect their stores to YouTube and enable shopping across their live streams and videos. There’s more to come here.
Moving on to Cloud, which surpassed a $6 billion quarterly revenue mark for the first time. Q2 revenue grew to $6.3 billion, with momentum across Google Cloud Platform and Workspace.
We saw continued demand in all geographies with global brands like Target in North America, H&M Group in Europe, Banco BV in Latin America and BioPharma in Asia.
We launched Google Public Sector in June, expanding our commitment to help U.S. government agencies and public institutions accelerate their digital transformations. From New York State and Arizona State University to the U.S. Forest Service and the state of Rhode Island, customers are choosing Google Cloud as their technology partner because of our leadership in four areas. First, we continue to lead in the data cloud market because we unify data lakes, data warehouses, data governance and advanced machine learning into a single platform that can analyze data across any cloud.
Companies like S.C. Johnson, Northwell Health and the Golden State Warriors choose Google Cloud for our strength in data analytics. Our capabilities helped Swiss Air optimize its flight operations. They’re also helping ENGIE explore ways to optimize wind energy management and Ford, to create smarter factory floors.
Second, companies like BetaBank and Mayo Clinic choose their open cloud infrastructure to modernize their IT systems on our cloud, at the edge or in their data centers. Our infrastructure scales to help customers like Deutsche Telekom modernize its network, Wipro to modernize its core systems, and Garvan Institute of Medical Research to process 14,000 genomes in under two weeks. Our multi-cloud strategy remains a differentiator for customers like Elevance Health, formerly known as Anthem and AMD.
Third, cybersecurity. Google has always provided a secure cloud infrastructure, and we continue to introduce new cybersecurity products that help customers deduct, protect and respond to a broad range of cybersecurity threats. Customers like GitLab, Highmark Health and Iron Mountain protect their critical systems and data with our products. Carryable Coffee and Etsy are among the 5 million websites protected by our cybersecurity technology.
Finally, Google Workspace’s easy to use and secure communication and collaboration tools continue to be chosen by many organizations as they return to hybrid work. Google Workspace helped St. Luke’s Medical Center, a leading health care system in the Philippines address a 38% increase in telehealth visits during the pandemic. Results like this are driving growth in many customer segments around the world, including digital natives like Canva, large enterprises like Travis Perkins plc and public sector institutions, including the Central Dutch Government.
Finally, our other bets. Waymo expanded rider-only testing with employees to include Downtown Phoenix and started testing at Phoenix’s Sky Harbor Airport. It also began charging trusted tested riders in San Francisco, a step closer to launching a commercial service with fully autonomous trips.
Waymo also opened a new facility to support Waymo Via, their autonomous Class 8 trucking solution as they continue to increase their operations and investment across the Southwest region. Calico is testing an investigational drug treatment in patients with ALS, developed in collaboration with AbbVie. It’s an early step of many in the development process.
Wing recently surpassed 250,000 commercial deliveries and unveiled a series of delivery drone prototypes able to carry different sized packages. There is good progress here and will continue to be intentional across the portfolio.
To close, while the economic outlook is uncertain, it’s been great to see people gathering in person again. We are pleased to see people coming back into the office more often, resulting in more opportunities for collaboration. It’s a privilege to build technology that’s helpful in both, good times and uncertain ones. And I want to thank everyone at Alphabet and Google for their work and support of people, businesses and all of our partners, everywhere. Over to you, Philipp. Thanks, Sundar, and hi, everyone. It’s always great to be with you all.
As Sundar indicated, we’re as focused as ever on helping businesses navigate complexity and operate from a position of confidence. AI-powered tools, insights and automation are arming customers and partners with the ability to stay agile and responsive so they can capture short-term opportunities while also building for the long term. You’ve seen our own commitment to the long term in our latest innovation announcements at I/O, Google Marketing Life and Brandcast.
Sundar covered a number of these. I’ll dive deeper into a few more, including how we’re improving our advertiser experiences and building simpler, more useful products for our partners.
Within Google Services, Search delivered strong revenue growth for the second quarter, driven by performance in both, travel and retail. In travel, users appetite continued to remain strong heading into the summer season. Searches for places to visit in summer were up 2x globally year-over-year, while searches for last-minute hotel deals were up 50%. However, as we’ve all seen in the news recently, the travel sector has been experiencing some challenges. As always, we’re committed to helping our travel partners navigate this with insights and new tools.
Then there’s retail, where we had another solid quarter. At GML, we highlighted how we’re continuing to innovate to help merchants make the most of how quickly consumer shopping is evolving, like Best Buy who’s embracing a full omnichannel approach from measurement to bidding to using omni ad formats across Google. By adopting omni across its local inventory ads portfolio and showcasing curbside and in-store pickup, Best Buy increased in-store revenue from Google Ads by 34% last year.
Today’s customers expect to shop wherever, whenever, and they care as much about local as they do about finding inspiration for the next purchase online. In Q2, searches for open now and near me were up 8x globally year-over-year, while searches for designer outlet jumped 90%. We also saw strong interest in apparel categories like women’s clothing and in beauty categories like perfume and fragrances.
With AI-powered tools like Performance Max, which local and smart shopping campaigns will upgrade to in time for the holidays, we’re helping businesses move at speed and scale to reach new and existing customers wherever they are in their shopping journey with relevant useful content.
We’ve seen strong momentum with PMax. Advertiser adoption is up 5 times year-to-date. Sustainable Apparel brand, Rothy’s drove a 59% increase in conversions and a 60% increase in revenue after turning to PMax. By leveraging its creative assets and showing them at scale, Rothy’s reached more customers in a way it hadn’t been able to do before.
Innovating across Search and YouTube also remain top priorities. Sundar mentioned new 3D AR features. Target and Wayfair are testing these to help customers see and shop products in real life.
We launched new ad formats for more visual browsy search experiences. And then there’s cool live commerce capabilities like live direct which let creators start a shopping live stream on their channel and then redirect viewers to a brand’s channel for more.
Let’s dive deeper into YouTube. In the second quarter, the biggest factor in the year-over-year comparison was the lapping of a very strong second quarter in 2021 when we experienced a strong recovery from the impact of COVID in early 2020. Ruth will provide more details on this later on.
As we continue to help advertisers manage through uncertainty, I would point out three key highlights for YouTube. First, Brandcast joined the Upfronts in New York in May for the first time ever, a reflection of how digital and linear TV worlds are converging for both viewers and advertisers. As the number one streaming video platform to reach viewers across all devices with billions of hours of video watched every day, YouTube remains well-positioned to deliver the reach, results and relevance that advertisers need.
In fact, even in TV’s biggest moments, YouTube is still delivering huge incremental reach. According to Comscore, 49.9% of adults that saw a Super Bowl ad on YouTube on the day of the Super Bowl did not see the ad on TV. And as more advertisers tap into connected TV, they’re also driving results.
According to Google commissioned Nielsen meta-analysis of MMMs that measured YouTube CTV and TV across U.S. consumer packaged goods, on average, YouTube CTV effectiveness was 3.1 times greater than TV. Take GSK Consumer Healthcare, now Haleon, who piloted CTV campaigns across its top 10 global markets to drive effectiveness at scale and tap into the shift to streaming. The results, 73% of campaigns drove substantial lift in brand and unbranded searches, and viewers were up to 14 times more likely to search for Haleon related terms. Adding CTV to its existing plans also led to greater efficiencies and savings. Haleon has since opted its 2022-2023 investment and is now expanding CTV across LATAM and EMEA markets.
Second, as Sundar said, our momentum in Shorts continues. Last quarter, we shared that we’re in the early stages of testing monetization with ads, and we continue to be encouraged by the results so far.
Third, there’s full funnel, which we’ve covered before, and more advertisers are embracing. On average, YouTube advertisers using a full funnel strategy experienced 80% unique reach across brand and action campaigns. With this incremental reach across upper and lower funnel formats, advertisers meet different audiences based on where they are in the purchase journey.
Estee Lauder Taiwan’s recent campaign for its advanced night repair serum is a great example. Branded content collaboration with top creators raised awareness, while YouTube shopping shelf feature boosted consideration, and to generate new leads and sales, a series of well-orchestrated action formats did the trick. This full funnel strategy drove 29% more unique visits to its website and a 95% increase in sales. With our performance products, advertisers can convert demand with our massive reach products, they create net new demand at scale.
Lastly, an update on how we’re bringing the best across Google to our partners and key ecosystems.
First, in gaming, to help Bandai Namco Entertainment drive immersive gaming experiences and build a more robust IP strategy, we’re partnering across Cloud, Geo, Ads, YouTube and more. And then there’s news. Google News showcase now has 1,500-plus partnerships with publications across 17 countries, including recent agreements with publications in the UK, Romania and Slovakia.
I’ll close, as I always do, with gratitude for customers and partners and for Googlers across sales, partnerships, product engineering and our many, many support teams. Thank you for your tireless commitment to making a positive impact around the world. Ruth, over to you. Thank you, Philipp.
Our financial results for the second quarter reflect strength in Search and momentum in Cloud. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter, unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook.
For the second quarter, our consolidated revenues were $69.7 billion, up 13% or up 16% in constant currency. Our total cost of revenues was $30.1 billion, up 15%, primarily driven by other cost of revenues, which was $17.9 billion, up 17%. The biggest factor here was costs associated with data centers and other operations.
Operating expenses were $20.1 billion, up 24%, reflecting the following: first, the increase in R&D expenses, which was driven primarily by headcount growth; second, the growth in sales and marketing expenses, which was driven primarily by increased spending on ads and promo followed by headcount growth; and finally, the growth in G&A, which reflects increases in both, professional service fees and in headcount, partially offset by a decline in charges related to legal matters.
Operating income was $19.5 billion, flat versus last year, and our operating margin was 28%. Other income and expense was a loss of $439 million. Net income was $16 billion. We delivered free cash flow of $12.6 billion in the quarter and $65 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with $125 billion in cash and marketable securities.
Let me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with our Google Services segment. Total Google Services revenues were $62.8 billion, up 10%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $40.7 billion in the quarter were up 14%, driven by both, travel and retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $7.3 billion were up 5%. The modest year-on-year growth rate primarily reflects lapping the uniquely strong performance in the second quarter of 2021. Network advertising revenues of $8.3 billion were up 9%, driven by AdSense. The quarter-on-quarter deceleration in both YouTube and network advertising revenues primarily reflects pullbacks in spend by some advertisers.
Other revenues were $6.6 billion, down 1%, reflecting a year-on-year decline in play, primarily driven by the fee changes we have discussed previously. We also saw a slowdown in buyer spend due to a number of factors, including lower engagement levels compared with earlier stages of the pandemic.
In terms of costs within Google Services, TAC was $12.2 billion, up 12%. Google Services operating income was $22.8 billion, up 2%, and the operating margin was 36%.
Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $6.3 billion for the second quarter, up 36%. GCP’s revenue growth was again greater than Cloud’s, reflecting significant growth in both, infrastructure and platform services. Strong revenue growth in Google Workspace was driven by solid growth in both, seats and average revenue per seat.
Google Cloud had an operating loss of $858 million. As to our other bets for the second quarter, revenues were $193 million and the operating loss was $1.7 billion.
Let me close with some comments on our outlook. In terms of the Google Services segment, we are pleased with our performance in Search in the second quarter, which continued to deliver strong results. As a reminder, the 2022 revenue growth rates are presented against particularly tough comps as we lapped the recovery in the second quarter of 2021 from the impact of the pandemic in early 2020. Going forward, the very strong revenue performance last year continues to create tough comps that will weigh on year-on-year growth rates of advertising revenues for the remainder of the year.
In YouTube and Network, the pullbacks in spend by some advertisers in the second quarter reflects uncertainty about a number of factors that are challenging to disaggregate. Within other revenues in the third quarter, we expect an ongoing headwind from the fee changes and the slowdown in buyers spend that impacted results in the second quarter.
Turning to Google Cloud. Customers are transforming their businesses, utilizing GCP’s secure infrastructure with data analytics and AI capabilities, uncovering real-time insights and leveraging the collaborative tools of workspace. They are in the early days of this transformation, and we continue to invest in our products, go-to-market capabilities and cloud regions.
In terms of foreign exchange, our second quarter results reflect the U.S. dollar strengthened versus last year from a significant tailwind last year to a 3.7 percentage-point headwind in 2Q. Looking to the third quarter, based on strengthening of the U.S. dollar quarter-to-date, we expect an even larger headwind from foreign exchange.
As a reminder, all segment revenues are reported on a GAAP basis. We provide fixed FX revenues only at the consolidated level and by geographic region. In addition, as we’ve said previously, the impact of foreign exchange is greater on operating income than it is on revenues, given that our expense base is weighted more toward the U.S. with most of our R&D efforts located here.
With respect to Alphabet headcount, we added 10,108 people in the second quarter with the majority of hires for technical roles. Given the uncertain global economic outlook and the hiring progress achieved to date, as Sundar previously announced, we intend to slow the pace of hiring. We expect our actions on hiring to become more apparent in 2023. Our headcount additions in the third quarter will reflect we already have a strong number of commitments, including new graduate hires.
As a reminder, we also expect the acquisition of Mandiant to close by the end of the year, which will further increase headcount on top of hiring. Although we expect the pace of headcount growth to moderate next year, we will continue hiring for critical roles, particularly focused on top engineering and technical talent.
Turning to CapEx. The largest investments in the second quarter were in servers followed by data centers and office facilities. After several large transactions closed in the first quarter, investment in office facilities was once again focused on fit-outs and ground-up construction on existing projects. We continue to expect an increase in CapEx in 2022 versus last year. For the balance of 2022, the increase will be particularly reflected in investments in technical infrastructure globally with servers as the largest component.
Thank you. Sundar Philip and I will now take your questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth from JP Morgan. Great. Thank you. Hopefully, you can hear me. I want to ask two questions. First, Sundar, just in your letter, you talked about how the economic challenges will serve as an opportunity for Alphabet to deepen its focus and invest for the long term. Just wanted to get a sense of how that might change the investment profile and areas of priority for the Company. And then, Ruth, I was hoping you could provide some color perhaps on how growth trended more through the second quarter, and if you have any comments on what you’re seeing so far in 3Q in July. Thank you. Thanks, Doug. As I said to the company, I think it’s a good time to sharpen our focus. Personally, I find moments like these clarifying. It’s a chance to digest and make sure we are working on the right things as a company with taking a long-term view, making sure we are continuing to invest in deep technology and computer science and doing differentiated work, and gives a chance to assess everything we are doing with the critical lens and reallocate resources to our most critical priorities. So, it’s a constrained optimization problem. I think it gives us a chance given the strong -- given a few years of strong growth to double down and focus, and we’re going to be very disciplined in terms of how we will approach it. But our focus on the long-term areas, be it AI, be it Cloud and other critical areas will continue. In terms of your second question, I’m going to leave the modeling to you. Just a bit of context, Sundar and I, I think, Philipp, as well used the term uncertainty because we do think that’s the best way to characterize what we’re seeing. The data are complicated. Our results have reflected lapping, continue to reflect lapping of the significant growth rates last year. On top of that, there is uncertainty in the global economic environment. And then, there are issues that differ across industry. You’ve seen it in the news for some of supply chain, for some of its inventory issues. So, we will leave the forecasting to you and try to give you sort of the components as we went through Q2 here. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Sundar, I just wanted to sort of follow up on the last question a little bit. I think, your tone around investment for the year changed somewhat over the course of the last few weeks. You’ve kind of gone through July and heard about slowing of hiring and now a reported hiring pause. You mentioned just recently, you’re finding moments like these to sort of optimize spend. Could you just talk to what are you seeing in your business specifically on the advertising side or the cloud side that is sort of saying now is when we really do need to make sure we’re optimizing? Are you seeing pullbacks, or is it more sort of just you’re seeing the macroeconomic headlines and wanted to get ahead of it? I think, Ruth gave color on what we are talking about as uncertainty, I think we see that as well. All of us are reacting to quite a varying set of dynamics, and it’s tough to summarize it because the factors -- underlying factors are different and they vary by maybe geography and verticals. But, there is some commonality to it in terms of the macro environment. So, there’s definitely something we are looking at and want to be more disciplined as we go forward. So, that’s the higher-level theme. I think in terms of underlying areas, pretty much I’m focusing my time on what are the right set of things to do with a longer term view. And I do think as a company, when you’re in growth mode, it’s tough to always take the time to do all the readjustments you need to do, and moments like this gives us a chance. So, I view it as an opportunity. And so, some of the sharpening our focus is taking advantage of the moment. And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs. Maybe I can ask a two-parter on YouTube. You’ve called out the tougher comps over the last couple of quarters. Can you give us a better sense of how you move away from some of those tougher comps in the periods ahead of us over the next 12 to 18 months, and how maybe we should think about the digestion of the direct response growth and consumption growth that YouTube saw a year ago and how that might lead to better growth ahead for YouTube in the periods going forward?
And then, when you look at the broader competitive landscape for video, how do you think about positioning YouTube short-form video versus long-form video or enabling creators and businesses to have tools to build their businesses within YouTube? How do you think about product development and aligning the product against the broader competitive landscape? Thanks, Eric. There was a lot in your question, so I’ll start and then I’ll pass it to Philipp. An obvious point as we’re pointing out, the lapping of what truly were extraordinary growth rates as time will get us through the lapping. So, that’s obvious math, but you asked the question. So, starting with that. And then, I did note that we have seen pullbacks in spend by some advertisers that, in fact, was the biggest factor in the quarter-on-quarter change, the sequential decline in the growth rate. And we’re -- that we do view that as rather idiosyncratic as I said, some of it’s supply chain, some of it’s inventory. And so, just working through that.
And then I would say, there were a couple of other factors that were relevant. The war was a modest headwind to year-on-year and sequential growth. AT&T impact, in fact, remained relatively constant, we’ve said that for the last couple of quarters. So that does remain headwind. So, we’re working through those. But again, it goes really to continuing to invest in YouTube and the experiences and the opportunity to deliver for our entire ecosystem users, creators. And why don’t I pass it to Philipp to maybe take you a step deeper into those. So, despite the pullback from some advertisers, we really believe YouTube remains well positioned to benefit from the shift to digital video, maybe first on brand. It’s worth calling out that this was first year participating in the Upfronts, which is really exciting and really a testament to YouTube’s evolution, and we were very pleased with our strong growth and upfront commitments.
Customers tell us they see value in YouTube’s reach and the ability to drive results. I talked about CTV earlier and as well on our last call, and we are very excited about the road map here. We’re also continuing to give advertisers unique and creative storytelling opportunities and the ability to lean into very precise KPIs and we recently rolled out some very critical measurement tools.
On the direct response side, we still think there’s a lot of runway to address commercial intent on YouTube between video action campaigns and app campaigns and product feeds and new live commerce features, where we’re testing a number of different things across live commerce. So, we’re excited about the opportunities here, especially to connect brands with creators.
We’re also seeing advertisers by YouTube at both ends of the funnel, which I talked about earlier, giving advertisers the ability to drive reach and relevance and action is really where YouTube excels. So, the big picture long term remained very encouraged by the opportunity for innovation at brand and DR and across YouTube.
And I can also briefly touch on the Shorts piece. Consumers are increasing at consuming short-form videos, obviously. We’re seeing this across multiple platforms, including YouTube. Sundar noted earlier that Shorts are being watched by 1.5 billion plus locked in users every month. So, overall, we’re continuing to see good user engagement on YouTube And last quarter, we shared that over the past two years, YouTube has seen significant growth in watch time and even as people have returned to in-person activities, time spent on YouTube globally has continued to grow. And as I said before, early results in Shorts monetization are also encouraging, and we’re excited about the opportunities here. And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Can I ask one to Ruth and Sundar and then want to Philipp? So Ruth and Sundar, given just how strong this company is in terms of balance sheet and profitability, I wonder what’s your North Star when you think about sharpening your focus? What’s driving your decision-making? Is there an optimal margin you’re looking to seek to or cash generation? So, I’m just trying to get -- when you say these things, I know what other companies have to do because, they are pressured on balance sheet or profitability. So, what is the mathematical form or way that you’re looking for that you’re driving towards?
And then, to Philipp, I think people are wondering just -- and this is a big question, but the composition of the ad base -- and I think people are worried that some other companies may have really benefited from a lot of growth in younger, newer companies that were not profitable. So, can you just talk a bit about what you’re seeing in terms of mix of your composition? Is there any shift maybe towards Fortune 500 companies that are spending more from a healthier maybe starting base? Anything you can tell us on composition of your ad base? I know it’s a huge question, but that would be helpful. Thanks. Maybe one thing I’ll say, through moments like this, look, I think for a few years, we’ve been talking about, particularly in our newer areas, the focus on building sustainable value. And so for me, it’s a long-term framework. We are obviously -- we have areas where we’ve been doing this for a long time, like Search and so on. But there are newer areas, and we definitely want to make sure while we are investing for the long term, we are thinking through the business model, the value creation and profitability over time.
And so, all of that are the frameworks we use. And I think it’s important, regardless of the health of your balance sheet on an area by area, everything you’re building is sustainable on its own and you’re very disciplined. And so, I think times like this gives us a chance to bring more focus and spend more time on with that lens. I would just add, we talked about this last year. Some of the operating margin upside last year was due to timing issues with the search or revenues, and we indicated at the time there was a lag in part on some of the investments whether that’s data centers or otherwise. And so, in part, you’re seeing some of that. But very much to Sundar’s point, the way we look at it is we are continuing to invest in long-term growth that has paid wonderful dividends for users and investors over the years. And we want to make sure we’re doing it responsibly and judiciously.
Some of these things pay out over the medium and longer term. And so, as he said a couple of times now, this notion of wanting to look at what are meaningful investments to deliver continued extraordinary experiences for services and users that then supports longer-term growth, it requires investments, and we just want to make sure that we’re getting that balance right and that we’re using resources effectively where we can to redeploy it and put it back into long-term investments. And so, it’s that sort of balancing act. Look, when it comes -- when it comes to the second part of your question, we have a very, very broad base of customers, large, small, different verticals, different sectors in different geographies across the world. We’re very proud to serve such a large base with such a diversity of different players.
It’s a broad question you’re asking, if you’re leaning a little bit more towards the total addressable market here. Let me reiterate what I said before. We’re not just addressing above-the-line marketing budgets, like traditional advertising or television advertising. There’s a lot of upside that we’ve seen below the line, budgets, whether it’s promotional pricing, product placements, sponsorships and so on, and the comps -- we see cuts across the universe of different players, sectors, verticals that I just described. But in the end, our mingle is on delivering great experiences for our users and driving incremental ROI for advertisers and then making them successful across all this big universe of sectors I just talked about. And I’m positive that budget should continue to move our ways as long as we stay focused on this one. Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. I hope you can hear me okay. I wanted to ask about Cloud. You mentioned several times Cloud momentum, and I know it was a very tough year-over-year comp, but growth did slow. Wondering if you’re seeing any pullback in new lift and ship projects or other new client adds, or if you’re seeing a little slowdown in volumes at all. And then, on the margins, is there any urgency to move margins towards breakeven, or is it still kind of investment mode here with a lot of different products and services to build? Thank you. On Cloud, we continue to see strong momentum, substantial market opportunity here and still feels like early stages of this transformation. Constantly in conversations with customers big and small, who are just undertaking the journey. So, it kind of shows you the opportunity ahead.
I would just say, nothing noticeable other than given we are in different geographies and different sectors, you do see a varying mix of some customers impacted in terms of their ability to spend, some customers just slightly taking longer times, and maybe in some cases, thinking about the term for which they’re booking and so on. So -- but I don’t necessarily view it as a longer term trend as much as working through the macro uncertainty everyone is dealing with. And then, in terms of your margin question, our view continues to be that this is an extraordinary opportunity. It’s a long-term opportunity and enterprise customers are still early in their move to the cloud. And so, we do very much have that debate that same question that you posed is the right one, which is a trade-off as between revenue growth and immediate profitability. And what we’re focused on is ensuring that we’re investing to support the long-term growth and given the upside that we see. And so, continue to focus on it and are looking at the path to profitability, path to cash flow positive to drive attractive returns. That’s obviously in the overall model of it, but very much believe in the long-term growth and believe this is the right level of investment across the business, go to market, the product teams continuing to build it out globally. And our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Ruth, good to see you lean into the buyback. I think it was your highest buyback ever, while other tech companies have kind of run away from it. I’m just curious if you could talk about your capital allocation strategy and ultimately how you’re thinking about the buyback. Thank you. I mean, at the heart of the capital allocation strategy is really what we’ve been talking about on this call, investing in long-term growth and driving cash flow. So, we have the opportunity to continue to invest and return capital to shareholders. We’re very pleased that we were able to increase the authorization up to $70 billion and do continue to believe it’s yet another valuable tool in the overall set of investments that we make. So, pleased to have it. Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from Evercore ISI. Philipp, you talk about the beginning of monetizing YouTube Shorts. Do you have any lessons that you’ve drawn so far, or in the long term is there any view you have on whether that inventory can be better or less monetized than other YouTube inventory that you’ve had traditionally historically?
And then, secondly, just on these comments on the pullback by some advertisers. So, you talk about strength in retail and especially in travel, so what’s left? Does that mean are you seeing weakness out of Western Europe in financial verticals and maybe automotive? Any color on which advertisers are pulling back would be helpful. Thank you. So, on the Shorts side, on the monetization side, I am sticking with the statement I made before. We are encouraged by the results that we’re seeing. We’re excited about the opportunity. And there’s not more -- not a lot more detail that we can share at this point in time.
On the pullback in spend by some of the advertisers, as Ruth mentioned, the pullbacks and spend on YouTube and network by some advertisers in the second quarter reflects uncertainty about a number of factors. And for each advertisers, it’s actually challenging to disaggregate the uncertainty, difference between companies and sectors. And as you can see from the news and some companies were impacted by multiple factors as well. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian from Baird. Maybe one follow-up, Sundar, on the sharpening of the focus. You talked about, of course, AI and cloud as being key areas of long-term focus. Are there any areas worth calling out that may be a lower priority now, given that focus? And then, secondly, you’ve given us some good data over the last year or so around conversational and visual search queries and strong growth there. Curious how that also translates into maybe different types of monetization relative to tech space search. Does this give you greater monetization capability in search, or how would that impact monetization? Thank you. Thanks. Good question. And look, one way we can think about it is through moments like this. So, for example, we are obviously investing deeply in AI. We do everything from pure research to applied research to research, which is now things AI work, which is actually happening very close or within the areas like Search and YouTube, et cetera.
And so, you can imagine a scenario in which we are prioritizing and on the margin moving resources to making sure we are driving product improvements, which flow through a moment like that. That would be an example of sharpening focus for me.
And when I think about the opportunities out of AI, just coming out of I/O this year, looking at the progress we have made, how much we have made progress with multisearch, how multimodal things are getting and the fact that people are now actually doing voice searches a lot, visual searches a lot, all that is a good example of how we are driving value in our core products.
Similarly, if you take at ads at Google Marketing Live, the team talked a lot about AI-driven products and features that really give value to advertisers in the most privacy-forward way. And cloud is, I would say, lot of the AI opportunity today plays out as more from a data analytics standpoint. It’s within that segment, we see the most strength. But over time, I think there’ll be broader opportunities as well. And on top of it all, we are continuing to see a lot of breakthrough work coming from our research teams, be it LaMDA 2, PaLM, Minerva or some of our recent advances.
So, we’ll stay cutting-edge drive progress and keep focusing on turning that research into real products and applications, and we’ll take a long-term view. And our last question comes from the line of Ross Sandler from Barclays. So maybe just following up on the retail segment. So, some of the biggest retailers in the world, like Walmart, are really struggling and are looking to cut costs and sounded to me from what Ruth just said about supply chain inventory inflation that they might be cutting on YouTube. So, I’m just curious, can you flesh out what you guys are doing in search from a product perspective to keep that retail category as strong as it is? You mentioned PMax for some of the smaller advertisers, an omnichannel for the larger, but maybe just elaborate on how that -- what strategy you guys are using to keep that spend flowing, or is that just a timing thing and it might drop off at some point in the future? Thanks a lot. Yes. Thank you. This is an excellent question. As I noted in my opening remarks, retail continued to be an important driver of Search in the second quarter. We saw strong Search interest in several categories. I called out apparel categories, like women’s clothing earlier. I think it’s also worth clarifying when we talk about retail growth, we’re talking about our overall approach to retail, which runs through all of our ads products and services, and our shopping strategy is just one important piece of that.
From a trend perspective, you’re absolutely right, omnichannel remains the way to win, retailers continue to build their digital presence to drive both online and offline sales, and we’re obviously helping them do it. Over the last few quarters, I think I’ve talked quite a bit about the ways how we’re doing this in Q2. Like in Q1, we saw a year-over-year increase in adoption of, for example, local inventory ads. These are mobile first and location-based and helping businesses of all sizes showcase their products and stock, in-store, online or available for store, curbside pickup, all different variations. Additionally, we’re midway through the migration from smart shopping campaigns into Performance Max, which you also mentioned, and advertisers have been pleased with increased reach and the increased performance.
And our focus really has always been on building tools and features that help both, offline and online businesses connect directly with these customers across our platforms. And we’re excited about what’s next for retail commerce across our services, especially Search and YouTube. And we will remain focused on building helpful great products and experiences for both, users and these businesses. Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I’d like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any closing remarks. Thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter 2022 call. Thank you, and have a good evening. Thank you. This concludes today’s conference call.

And now, I’ll turn the call over to Sundar. Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone.
Our financial results for the third quarter reflect healthy fundamental growth in Search and momentum in Cloud. Our reported results reflect the effect of foreign exchange. The growth in our advertising revenues was also impacted by lapping last year’s elevated growth levels and the challenging macro climate.
We are sharpening our focus on a clear set of product and business priorities. The product announcements we have made in just the past month alone have shown that very clearly, including significant improvements to Search powered by AI, new ways to monetize YouTube Shorts, which will support the creator ecosystem, the strong series of hardware launches and a new partnership and product announcements at Cloud Next. These will all drive value for users, partners and our business.
We have also started our work to drive efficiency by realigning resources to invest in our biggest growth opportunities. Over the past quarter, we have made several shifts away from lower priority efforts to fuel higher growth priorities. Our Q4 headcount additions will be significantly lower than Q3. And as we plan for 2023, we’ll continue to make important trade-offs where needed and are focused on moderating operating expense growth.
Throughout Google’s history, periods of dedicated focus have enabled us to emerge strongly and unleash new eras of computing innovation. For example, over a decade ago, focusing the Company’s efforts on mobile helped us to build and grow our business for the shift to mobile computing. We are at a similar point now with AI, another transformational technology. Our investments in AI and deep computer science mean that we can deliver a wide range of breakthroughs across our products and services to help people, businesses and communities.
Turning to the quarter. First, our core information products. At our Search On event, we shared how we are using AI advances to deliver a more natural and intuitive search experience. These advancements will soon help to surface things you might find helpful before you even finish typing. We are also making visual search more natural than ever before. People now use Google Lens to answer more than 8 billion questions every month using just a photo or an image. Now, we are supercharging our visual search capabilities to help people find what they are looking for at businesses nearby. Philipp will also talk in more detail about our work to make it easier to shop on Google, a key focus.
Google Lens also has an amazing translation feature. It can now blend translated text seamlessly into the background of images, like menus or street signs in just 100 milliseconds, shorter than a blink of an eye. Through advanced language models, AI is unlocking new experiences that support more natural and conversational ways to interact with computing. LaMDA is one of our most promising models for this. It’s now available to demo in our AI Test Kitchen, which offers a way for people to experience and give feedback on emerging AI technology.
DeepMind also debuted its most helpful and safest language model yet. Sparrow can talk to users, answer questions and provide evidence-based answers using Google Search.
Moving to YouTube, another big priority. We remain focused on long-term growth for our community of viewers, creators and advertisers. To that end, we announced some exciting changes at our Made on YouTube event last month. First, improving the monetization of Shorts. This is a big deal for creators and for our business. We’ll introduce revenue sharing on Shorts early next year. This update makes YouTube the only platform where creators can monetize their content across short, long and live formats at scale.
Shorts continues to show great user momentum, and we continue to invest in our mobile video tools for creators. We are seeing mobile-first creators investing more in the platform, creating content that helps the broader community grow. TV is a big area for us as well. Nielsen reported that YouTube was the leader in streaming TV viewership in the U.S. in September for the first time.
Turning next to hardware. Hardware is an important area of investment for us. We are investing deeply from the silicon to the OS to powerful software experiences because it’s a big opportunity to move computing forward and build deeper relationships with people who love using Google products. It also really helps to guide the Android ecosystem beyond just building the underlying platform.
Earlier this month, we introduced the Pixel 7, the Pixel 7 Pro and the very first Pixel Watch. We’ve also previewed more detail about the Pixel Tablet, which is coming in 2023. Pixel combines our foundational technologies, AI, Android and our Google Tensor G2 processor to bring state-of-the-art AI directly to the device. The Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro offer industry-leading photography features that can unblur or sharpen photos and shoot cinema-quality videos.
We recently had our highest selling week ever for Pixel, and I’m really proud of the positive reviews so far. Along with great devices, we introduced our latest release of Android. Android 13 offers new personalization features, improved privacy controls and a more seamless experience with connected devices.
Next, Google Cloud. We see continued momentum with Q3 revenue of $6.9 billion with Google Cloud Platform’s revenue growth rate above the aggregate. I’ve long shared that cloud is a key priority for the Company. The long-term trends that are driving cloud adoption continue to play an even stronger role during uncertain macroeconomic times. Google Cloud helps customers solve today’s business challenges, improve productivity, reduce costs and unlock new growth engines. At Cloud Next, we unveiled more than 100 new products and announced new and expanding relationships with Toyota, Prudential plc, Coinbase and AppLovin.
The shift to hybrid work continues with organizations evolving to support an increasingly distributed workforce. I’m proud to share that Google Workspace is now used by more than 8 million businesses and organizations worldwide. That includes Korean Air as well as the U.S. Army, which is transitioning 250,000 personnel to our secure communication and collaboration platform.
In the past year, we have announced nearly 300 new capabilities to support hybrid work. Empowering a distributed workforce brings an increased need for cybersecurity to keep workers’ data and critical business systems safe and secure. It’s top of mind for nearly every CEO I speak with, and customers, including the City of Los Angeles, Roche and Banorte put their trust in Google Cloud’s industry-leading products. Our new Chronicle Security Operations Suite unifies security analytics, automation response and threat intelligence. This has helped Vertiv analyze 22 times more security data while cutting investigation time in half.
In September, we closed our acquisition of Mandiant and are proud to welcome more than 2,600 colleagues to Google. With Mandiant, we add industry-leading threat intelligence and incident response capabilities to help customers stay protected at every stage of the security life cycle. Customers partner with Google Cloud because we offer a single platform that can analyze data across any cloud. Our leadership here is winning customers across industries, including the state of Hawaii and the Australia Securities Exchange. Our capabilities help solve difficult business challenges like supply chain and logistics while also creating new growth opportunities.
And as companies globally are looking to drive efficiencies, Google Cloud’s open infrastructure creates a valuable pathway to reduce IT costs and modernize. In addition, with our new Media CDN product for large media streaming workloads, we are helping Major League Baseball and Paramount+ deliver flawless experiences to their customers. And with Google Cloud Edge, Rite Aid is more efficiently helping patients in their pharmacies. Across all of these areas, I’m proud of the trust and enthusiasm our customers are placing in Google Cloud.
Briefly on our Other Bets, Waymo announced that Los Angeles will be its third ride-hailing city, joining Phoenix and San Francisco. Waymo will begin by mapping several neighborhoods in LA as it prepares to serve people there. Wing just surpassed 300,000 commercial deliveries. It’s servicing new areas in Australia and announced its first drone delivery trials in Ireland.
To close, times like this are clarifying. As we head into 2023, we are going to focus on our most important priorities as a company. To support our growth, we’ll continue to invest responsibly for the long term in a way that is responsive to the current economic environment. I want to thank our employees around the world for their contributions over the last quarter. We help people, our partners and society when we focus on what we do best and execute on that really well. Over to you, Philipp. Thanks, Sundar, and hello, everyone. It’s great to be joining you all today.
Google Services revenues of $61 billion were up 2% year-on-year, negatively affected by a sizable foreign exchange headwind. Search and other revenues grew 4% year-over-year to $40 billion, led by travel and retail, while both YouTube Ads and Network had modest year-over-year revenue declines. Other revenues were up 2% year-over-year with growth in YouTube non-advertising and hardware revenues offset by a decrease in Play revenues. Play revenues were lower due to a number of factors, including a decline in user engagement in gaming from the elevated levels seen earlier in the pandemic. Among other factors, this shift in user behavior also created downward pressure on our advertising revenues, with lower revenues from ad promo spend on YouTube, Network and Play Ads in Search and other.
I’ll highlight a couple of other trends that affected our ads business in Q3, and Ruth will provide more detail. On the second quarter earnings call, we noted a pullback in spend by some advertisers in YouTube and Network, and these pullbacks in spend increased in the third quarter. In Search and other, the largest factor in the deceleration in Q3 was lapping the outsized performance in 2021. In the third quarter, we did see a pullback in spend by some advertisers in certain areas and search ads.
For example, in financial services, we saw a pullback in the insurance, loan, mortgage and crypto subcategories. There’s no question we’re operating in an uncertain environment, and that businesses big and small continue to get tested in new and different ways, depending on where they are in the world.
When it comes to how we’re helping, our focus remains unchanged. The same AI driving breakthroughs in everything from protein folding, flood forecasting and language understanding is also fueling innovation across our Ads product. Via insights, automation and easier-to-use advertising tools and formats, we’re helping businesses stay agile, build resilience, anticipate the future and show up for customers in more connected, visual and consistent ways. We’re helping them understand demand, deal with inventory challenges, increase loyalty and much more.
In challenging times like these, advertisers are carefully evaluating the effectiveness of their budgets. Search tends to do relatively well in such an environment, given its strong measurability and focus on delivering ROI. It’s also well suited to quickly adjust to changes in consumer behavior. And when Search is coupled with our automation products across bidding, creatives, targeting or Performance Max, it can drive performance even further.
Let’s talk retail, an important vertical for us. No matter where shoppers are buying, whether it’s in store, online or both, we have the solutions to help them deliver results wherever their customers are. Take online fashion retailer REVOLVE, who uses global influencer network along with our category insights and automated tools to acquire new customers at lower costs. As festivals and events return to summer, REVOLVE used lower funnel solutions across search and shopping to engage with consumers in high-demand apparel categories, helping it cross $1 billion in trailing 12-month net sales for the first time.
And then, there’s Magazine Luiza, a large Brazilian retailer, who embraced omnichannel by measuring and bidding directly to store sales. Coupled with in-store pickup and notations via PMAX, Magazine Luiza drove a 38% ROAS over 30 days and has since expanded the strategy to all eligible products, including 8 million-plus new offers.
And whether shoppers know exactly what they’re looking for or are just seeking inspiration, we’re innovating to make it easier and more engaging for people to shop online across our services. From finding the best deals across all types of merchants, including 200 million-plus available daily deals in Q3 to new ways to search. Now when you type shop followed by whatever item you’re looking for, you’ll unlock a visual content stream of ideas that feel just like window shopping but online.
And then there’s YouTube. Not only can users now buy more products and videos, but shopping as entertainment experiences are bringing the magic of our creators to the shopping experience. Like in September, when Kylie and Kris Jenner hosted an exclusive shopping stream event to celebrate the debut of a new Kris collection for Kylie Cosmetics. And at Adweek last week, not only did we announce that product feeds are coming to discovery, but that creators will soon be able to take products from brands across their videos, Shorts and live streams. This means viewers can shop products seamlessly while they watch their favorite content, while merchants can drive incremental reach and engagement for free listing offers when tagged by creators that viewers love and trust.
I already touched on YouTube’s performance in the quarter. Let’s deep dive into what we’re focused on. First, we’re helping advertisers understand how they can drive effectiveness with every campaign they run on YouTube. Full funnel is a key way to do this. Buying YouTube across consideration, awareness and action allows marketers to meet customers at different stages in their purchasing journey, which we know are increasingly complex while delivering towards a key business goal.
Creative and Media work together across the funnel to create new demand and convert current demand. Castlery, a single furniture retailer activated a full funnel approach as part of its U. S. expansion. It used brand and action formats, identified its most relevant audiences and built a robust measurement framework to boost sales and awareness, including a 65% increase in U.S. brand searches. Castlery is using the same strategy for the upcoming holiday season.
Two other areas where we’re continuing to invest, Connected TV and Shorts. First on CTV. Eyeballs keep moving away from traditional TV. On average, global viewers are watching 700 million-plus hours of YouTube content on TV daily. And according to Nielsen, during the 2021-2022 U.S. broadcast seasons, YouTube reached more viewers during primetime on CTV than any linear TV network.
Brands continue to take notice. Like Instacart, who tapped into CTV to maximize its TV screen strategy for its The World is Your Cart brand campaign featuring Lizzo. It drove breakout searches for its product and above-average brand lift across awareness, consideration and purchase intent. And it also engaged a significant increase in audience on top of TV with 66% lower CPMs.
And then there’s Shorts. 1.5 billion users every month, 30 billion daily views. Engagement is strong. We’ve always said that we focus on building great user and creator experiences first and then follow that with monetization over time. As of September, ads on Shorts have officially launched via video action, app and Performance Max campaigns.
As Sundar mentioned, we also extended the YouTube Partner Program and announced our revenue sharing model for Shorts creators, the first of its kind for short-form content. It’s early but we’re encouraged by the progress we’ve made this year in Shorts monetization and support for sustaining the creator ecosystem.
I’ll close with something I’ve said before and I think it’s worth reiterating. Our success is only possible when our customers and partners succeed. Whether it’s helping individual YouTube creators or Play developers make a living and build thriving businesses or bringing the best across Google to our partners, our focus on driving growth for our partners and key ecosystems remain steadfast. I’m proud that over the past three years, we’ve paid creators, artists and media companies over $50 billion.
In terms of how we’re helping our partners innovate, I’ll share two highlights. First, a transformative partnership with Transsion, the number one OEM in Africa and Pakistan, will help it close the digital divide by doubling annual activations by 2025 and build helpful products for the next billion users. And then in commerce with FEMSA Digital in Mexico, we’re bringing together solutions across Ads, Cloud, Maps, Waze and beyond to bolster its data and analytics capabilities so it can better reach and retain its beverage and retail customers.
On behalf of many, a massive thank you to our customers and partners for their collaboration, trust and feedback. And another massive thank you to our sales, partnerships, product, engineering and support teams. The hard work, dedication and ingenuity of Googlers, especially during more challenging times, is truly second to none. On that note, over to you, Ruth. Thank you, Philipp.
Our financial results for the third quarter reflect healthy fundamental growth in Search and momentum in Cloud. Our reported results clearly reflect the effect of foreign exchange. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter, unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook.
For the third quarter, our consolidated revenues were $69.1 billion, up 6% or up 11% in constant currency. Our total cost of revenues was $31.2 billion, up 13%, primarily driven by other cost of revenues, which was $19.3 billion, up 20%. The biggest factor here was costs associated with data centers and other operations, followed by hardware costs. Operating expenses were $20.8 billion, up 26%, reflecting the following: first, the increases in R&D and G&A expenses, which were driven primarily by headcount growth; and second, the growth in sales and marketing expenses, which was driven primarily by increased spending on ads and promotions, followed by headcount growth.
Operating income was $17.1 billion, down 19% versus last year and our operating margin was 25%. Other income and expense was a loss of $902 million. Net income was $13.9 billion. We delivered free cash flow of $16.1 billion in the quarter and $63 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with $116 billion in cash and marketable securities.
Let me now turn to our segment financial results. As a reminder, we provide fixed foreign exchange revenues only at the consolidated level and by geographic region. All segment revenues are reported on a GAAP basis.
Starting with our Google Services segment. Total Google Services revenues were $61.4 billion, up 2%. Across our advertising revenues, the year-over-year deceleration in growth rates versus the third quarter of last year was largely driven by lapping very strong performance, most notably in Search and other revenues. Additionally, the year-on-year deceleration on YouTube and Network reflects a pullback in spend by some advertisers as we first noted last quarter.
In terms of the revenue lines, Google Search and other advertising revenues of $39.5 billion in the quarter were up 4%. YouTube advertising revenues of $7.1 billion were down 2%. Network advertising revenues of $7.9 billion were down 2%. Other revenues were $6.9 billion, up 2%, reflecting several factors: first, subscriber growth in YouTube Music Premium and YouTube TV continued to drive ongoing strong growth in YouTube non-advertising revenues; second, we delivered solid growth in hardware revenues, primarily from sales of the Pixel 6a; finally, the growth in these two areas was offset by a year-on-year decline in Play revenues, reflecting a slowdown in buyer spend due to a number of factors, including lower engagement levels in gaming compared with earlier stages of the pandemic.
In terms of costs within Google Services, TAC was $11.8 billion, up 3%. Google Services operating income was $19.8 billion, down 17% and the operating margin was 32%.
Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $6.9 billion for the second quarter, up 38%. GCP’s revenue growth was again greater than Cloud’s, reflecting significant growth in both, infrastructure and platform services. Strong revenue growth in Google Workspace was driven by growth in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had an operating loss of $699 million. As to our Other Bets for the third quarter, revenues were $209 million and the operating loss was $1.6 billion.
Let me close with some comments on our outlook. Our results in the third quarter reflect an increased headwind from foreign exchange, given the ongoing strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus last year. Excluding the revenue benefit from hedging, there was a 6-point headwind year-on-year or 5 points with the hedge benefit compared with a slight tailwind in the third quarter of 2021.
Looking to the fourth quarter, based on strengthening of the U.S. dollar quarter-to-date, we expect an even larger headwind from foreign exchange. In addition, as we have previously said, the impact of foreign exchange is greater on operating income than it is on revenues, given that our expense base is weighted more toward the U.S. with most of our R&D efforts located here.
Turning to our segment results. Within the Google Services segment, Search and other revenues had healthy fundamental growth in the third quarter, which was affected by the impact of currency movements. As I already noted, the largest driver of the deceleration in year-on-year growth of Search compared with 3Q ‘21 was lapping the outsized growth in 2021. The sequential deceleration in the year-on-year growth of Search in the third quarter versus the second quarter was also driven by lapping with an additional headwind from pullback in advertiser spend in some areas.
In YouTube and Network, the sequential deceleration of year-on-year growth in the third quarter versus the second quarter primarily reflects further pullbacks in advertiser spend. In the fourth quarter, the very strong revenue performance last year will continue to create tough comps that will weigh on the year-on-year growth rates of advertising revenues.
Within other revenues, we expect an ongoing headwind from the slowdown in buyer spend on Google Play due to a number of factors, including lower levels of user engagement in gaming that impacted results in the second and third quarters. As Philipp mentioned, among other factors, this shift in user behavior was also a headwind to advertising revenues, with lower revenues from app promo spend on YouTube, Network and Play ads in Search and other.
Turning to Google Cloud. Our results reflect momentum across GCP and Workspace. Customers globally are adopting our products and services to digitally transform their businesses. We are excited about the opportunity, given that businesses and governments are still in the early days of public cloud adoption and we continue to invest accordingly. We remain focused on the longer-term path to profitability.
In terms of profitability, we have an effort underway to ensure we redeploy investments against our most compelling opportunities. As we noted on our second quarter call, our actions to slow the pace of hiring will become more apparent in 2023.
With respect to Alphabet headcount, we added 12,765 people in the third quarter, including more than 2,600 of those joining Google Cloud as part of our acquisition of Mandiant. As in prior quarters, the majority of hires were for technical roles. In the fourth quarter, we expect headcount additions will slow to less than half the number added in Q3. Within this slower headcount growth, next year, we will continue hiring for critical roles, particularly focused on top engineering and technical talent.
Turning to CapEx, we continue to make significant investments in technical infrastructure with servers as the largest component.
Thank you. Sundar, Philipp and I will now take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan of Goldman Sachs. Thank you very much. Maybe two questions, if I can. Sundar, first, I think what investors are very curious about is how much this change in terms of aligning investment against your priorities is a reflection of what you expect to happen over the next 6 to 12 months in the broader macro environment versus a longer term perspective of maybe maximizing for productivity and efficiency. Would love to get your philosophy on that.
And then, Philipp, a lot of comments in there about YouTube and the potential for growth going forward. Can you go a little bit deeper on what you’re seeing in terms of both the opportunity set to drive revenue and turn a possible headwind to a tailwind with respect to Shorts and Connected TV over the medium to long term. Look, I would say, it’s a combination. Obviously, as a company, over time, we’ve had periods of extraordinary growth, and then there are periods where I viewed it as a moment where you take the time to optimize the Company to make sure we are set up for the next decade of growth ahead. I view this as one of those moments. It gives us a chance to make sure we are with clarity identifying what are the most important areas and making sure we are directing our incremental investments towards those and as well as where we can realign. So, I view this as an opportunity to do that and also being responsive to the current macro environment we are seeing. Yes. And from my side, Eric, in the third quarter, as I mentioned, there was a further pullback in spend by some advertisers across both brand and direct response. But overall, I feel YouTube remains in a really good position to continue to benefit from the streaming boom. In direct response, we think there’s a lot of room to run to make really YouTube more shoppable, more actionable from video action campaigns to product feeds, app campaigns, live commerce features.
Advertisers are turning to YouTube to convert intent into action and really drive performance at scale. Product feeds are coming to Discovery ads soon and recent expanded to Shorts. We’re already seeing results. And in fact, on average, video action campaigns with product feeds saw an over 70% increase in conversions on Shorts versus those without.
On the brand side, as I said earlier, eyeballs are moving away from linear TV, and we’re helping brands move beyond tradition, lets -- to efficiently really achieve their reach and awareness goals. And obviously, you mentioned that as well as connected TV is an important part of this strategy. When you think about it, YouTube is really the best place for advertisers to reach new consumers across multiple formats and screens from shorts to long-form, podcast, music all the way to CTV. Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one for Sundar or Ruth. Sundar, just to go back to the comment about earlier in the quarter, becoming 20% more efficient. I thought tonight, your comment on investing responsibly over the long term of being responsive to the environment is helpful. If I look at sort of the Excel sheet, I think you’ll have added about 51,000 new people to the company since the start of last year.
Can you give us some examples of internal KPIs or quantifiable analysis you’re running just to ensure you’re generating ROI for investors from all your hiring as you sort of run through these analyses? That’s the first one. Then the second one, Philipp, just on Shorts, are you seeing Shorts lead to incremental time spent from those users, or is it more so you’re seeing the time shift from other forms of YouTube over to Shorts? Brian, I think -- look, I think we gave some -- we’ve been clear that we are going to moderate our pace of hiring going into Q4 as well as 2023. I think we are seeing a lot of opportunities across a whole set of areas. And every time, talent is the most precious resource, so we are constantly working to make sure everyone we’ve brought in is working on the most important things as a company and particularly so. And that’s a lot of what sharpening our focus has been about.
We are reviewing projects at all scales pretty granularly to make sure we have the right plans there, and based on that, the right resourcing and making course corrections. And this will be an ongoing thing. It is something we’ll continue doing going into ‘23 as well. Yes. And to the second part of the question, as we discussed before, we’ve always focused on building a great user and creator experience first, followed by increasing monetization over time. We continued to experience a slight headwind to revenues as Shorts viewership grew as a percentage of total YouTube watch time. And as I alluded to earlier, the initial progress on Shorts monetization has been encouraging. And we’re focused on closing the monetization gap between Shorts and long-form content on YouTube over time. And more specifically, consumers are increasingly consuming short-form video, and we’re seeing this across multiple platforms, including YouTube. And as I said earlier, Shorts are being watched by 1. 5 billion-plus logged-in users every month. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth of JP Morgan. Ruth, you highlighted momentum in Cloud and growth accelerated in 3Q. Are you seeing any changes in Cloud demand as existing or potential customers perhaps rethink their priorities? And then, how should we think about the pace of investments at Cloud going forward? Do you still believe that you’re in more catch-up mode, or should we expect a more stable rate of investment and greater profit improvement? Thanks. Thanks for the question. Yes, we are pleased with the ongoing momentum. It’s across a wide range of industries and geographies. And it really comes back to the team’s focus on helping them solve unique business issues and innovate in new areas as they digitally transform. I think more to your question, and we talked about this about last quarter, in some cases, certain customers are taking longer to decide, and some have committed to deals with shorter terms or smaller deal sizes, which we attribute to a more challenging macro environment. Some are impacted due to reasons that are specific to their business.
But overall, as you can see from the results here again, we’re pleased with the momentum in Cloud and do continue to be excited about the long-term opportunities. So, that’s why I made the comment that we do continue to invest meaningfully in this business. We’re still focused very much so on the path to profitability and free cash flow strength here, but we are continuing to invest in the business. And this fits within Sundar’s overall comments as we’re looking at how we prioritize. And they’re certainly making sure they’re focused on every element within their business. But fundamentally, to the heart of your question, we’re continuing to invest here. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Sundar, one for you and then one for you, Ruth. I’m going to ask you about TikTok but not as it relates to YouTube, more about Search. It looks like younger consumers are spending more time on TikTok searching for product reviews, recommendations, advice. I’m interested in learning if you’ve seen any changes in your search behavior by demographics in Google. And then, do you think search has become more visual, less text-based going forward in order to maintain more relevance for its younger users? So that’s one.
And then Ruth, can you kind of just dig in a bit on the OpEx growth in Google Services. You called out other cost of revenues being up 20%. It looks like as a percentage of revenues, it’s nearly an all-time high. Can you talk a bit about how much of that cost base is fixed versus variable? And anything on outlook on what’s driving kind of the spike this quarter and maybe what we expect going forward there on the cost of revenues? Thanks. Look, I think it’s always important that we try and understand our user segments and their needs so that we can make sure the products are helpful and working for them. And we ourselves conduct thousands of studies a year to understand how user needs are evolving. And as part of it, there are some studies which obviously show people, particularly younger users in certain categories, maybe fashion inspiration as an example, look for more visual ways to engage.
And so, these are all learnings we are constantly taking in and we use it to improve Search. And if you saw Search On, we had many explorations and product directions, which move in that direction. So, I think it’s a healthy way of iterating and innovating to build the best products and services for our users. And then, in terms of your question regarding margins, two parts really. On other cost of revenues, the biggest driver of the year-on-year increase in other cost of revenues does continue to be data centers and other operations. The change really here this quarter in Q3, the second largest driver was hardware. And then, CAC moved from its usual number 2 spot down to number 3. And there were really two key factors for the change in the rank order between hardware and CAC. Probably pretty self-evident but just to spell them out, the year-on-year decline in YouTube Ads revenues obviously muted the growth in CAC. And then the growth of Pixel phone sales due primarily to the launch of Pixel 6a drove that shift.
What we’re looking at overall sort of to your broader question about profitability in Google Services is the overall pace of investments. And now, we’re looking at how with the change -- mix change and ongoing opportunities to drive revenue growth, how it flows through all the way to op inc growth. And so to Sundar’s opening comments and as we’ve been talking about, some of the margin upside last year was due to timing issues with a very strong growth of revenues and there was a lag in investments. And what we’re focused on here is how do we continue to manage on a go-forward basis to deliver durable long-term results. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler of Barclays. Hey guys. Hate to beat the dead horse on the Google Services margin, but Ruth, you just mentioned mix shift. I think that’s a lot of what’s going on here. And given the trajectory that you’re seeing in Search and in Play, which we estimate are where most of the profit’s coming from in that segment versus some of those lower-margin items, YouTube subscription, hardware, et cetera. Maybe you could help frame the next like couple of years, is this going to land below pre pandemic, which I think was around where we are here at 32%? Could we see the 2Q ‘20 low of 27% for Google Services margin? Any help just framing where that might land would be helpful. Thank you. Well, I’ll, as I’m sure you would expect, leave the modeling to you, but there are two elements of it. And I think Sundar and Philipp really talked about the first part, which is the ongoing opportunity we see with Search, with YouTube, with some of the actions that we’re taking, the opportunity with AI applied to both, the opportunity as we continue to build-out monetization on YouTube Shorts in particular. So, we’re continuing to focus on both, the driver here, revenue, as well as the investments that we’re making. And I want to make sure, to Sundar’s comments about sharpening our focus that we are economizing, utilizing resources as effectively as possible. So, it is both, the efforts we’re taking around expense management and building for durable performance as well as the efforts we’re taking, which are in the investment line but drive top line performance.
I would say we also contextualize it and I tried to do that in response to Michael’s questions. And we said this last year, we’ve noted that some of the margin upside last year was due to timing issues. And we had a very strong growth in revenues, surge in revenues and a lag in investments that we said was a timing difference, and you are seeing some of that here. But to the main point, we’re looking at both what we can do to continue to support long-term revenue growth, but while doing so, being mindful of the pace of investment. I’ll leave the modeling to you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Ruth, on the pullback by some advertisers, is there a common thread that you can draw on common underlying characteristics that are pulling back versus those that are continuing to lean forward? Can you talk about that dynamic and what you’re seeing? Why don’t I start and then I’ll pass it to Phil for a bit more color potentially? Because I want to make sure that one of the comments that we made in the opening comments was very clear, which was the year-on-year story in ads was really lapping the very strong third quarter. And so to get to your question, you’re really talking about sequential decline on year-on-year growth. I think what’s notable in Search, we had really healthy growth in Q3, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The sequential deceleration in Search in the third quarter versus the second quarter was again primarily driven by lapping, and just I want to make sure that that was clear. There was some pullback from advertiser spend in some areas so I’ve noted that in opening comments. And then, in YouTube and Network, the sequential deceleration of year-on-year growth in both the second quarter -- the third quarter versus the second quarter was really further pullbacks in advertiser spend. Yes. That’s exactly right. And as I said earlier, in Search and other ads revenues, while lapping the outsized performance was the largest factor in Q3, we did see some advertiser pull back in certain areas in search ads. And I think the example I called out was in financial services, in the areas of insurance, loan, mortgage, crypto subcategories. And we also noted a pullback in spend by some advertisers on YouTube and Network. And these pullbacks in spend increased in the third quarter. And we also noted lower revenues from app promo spend on YouTube and Network. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of Evercore ISI. Apologies, we’ll need to go to the next question that comes from Maria Ripps. Maria Ripps of Canaccord, your line is open. Please stand by. We’re holding to see if there are technical difficulties. Thank you, all. And if the operator could keep us posted here, maybe even trying to -- yes. Thank you. Yes, ma’am. Thank you so much for your patience. Again, our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of Evercore ISI. Just checking. Can you hear me? We can hear you, Mark. Thank you. Okay. Two questions, please. One, Sundar, you’ve been with the Company for a long time. You’ve seen these cycles before. Can you put any context as to the -- as economic conditions wax and wane, the impact that has on Google? Like how does this environment look to you versus prior cycles that the Company has managed through?
And then Ruth, on the cost side, I understand the comments. I understand the comments about the headcount adds and what you plan to do in the fourth quarter. But could you talk about non-headcount-related costs and the opportunity you see or the need you see for managing those down? And do you see that there are significant opportunities to do that as well. So again, non-headcount costs. Thank you very much. Thanks, Mark. Well, a couple of things. I think compared to the past, I think are going through this. I mean, there is, as we have said before, there is more uncertainty as we go through. We definitely see indicators on both sides so that makes it a bit more unique. Number two, I would say the strength of Search, both as a product for users as well as for advertisers in terms of delivering ROI through a tough time in the ad market, I think, is great to see.
Third, just like when we went through it last time, ahead of us was a decade of mobile and the opportunities it brought. And to me, sitting now, looking at all the work that’s going on in AI, we’ve been an AI-first company for the past seven years in all the investments. And it looks like a big opportunity ahead. So keeping all that in mind, focused on the long term, using this moment to be disciplined and prioritize and focus, I think, will set us up well for the next decade ahead. And then, in terms of your second question, yes, I think the core to Sundar’s comment is with the rapid pace of growth that we’ve experienced, we see opportunities to focus more. And that drives opportunities to redeploy amazing talent we have into the highest priority efforts that we have and to be as effective and efficient as possible.
There are, obviously, to your question, non-payroll-associated expenses that also then attach. And so an operating environment like this adds urgency to prioritization. We want to make sure we’re using all resources as effectively and efficiently as possible. At the same time, as we’ve tried to be very clear, there are very exciting areas that we will continue to invest in.
And so, part of this is resource optimization, constraint optimization, however you want to describe it, we want to free up where we can to ensure we have capacity to invest as needed in opportunities that deliver these durable long-term results that we’ve talked about. And so, we’re trying to be smart about redeploying where we can, finding efficiencies where we can while still investing for long-term growth. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Maria Ripps of Canaccord. First, you talked about strength in retail and travel. Can you maybe talk about automotive advertising and whether you’re seeing any signs of recovery as supply has been normalizing? And if so, how might this rebound sort of compared to prior cycles? And then secondly, just on Performance Max, it seems like it continues to do pretty well here. So, based on your conversations with advertisers, are there any specific features or functionality that you would call out as significant drivers of the product attractiveness? And is there any color you can add maybe around relative ROI of PMAX? Yes. So, there’s really no additional color. Thank you very much for your question, but there’s really no additional color on other verticals apart from the ones I mentioned already that I think we should share here at this moment. On the Performance Max side, we’ve touched on earlier and in prior quarters and just as a little reminder, it’s our fully automated Google Ads campaign tied with the most channel and inventory coverage, that really helps advertisers deliver a better ROI.
And we’ve been listening to feedback from advertisers and have continued to roll out more features since its initial launch to increase transparency and help advertisers steer the automation more effectively. And there are more future updates to come. In July, we launched a number of new settings, including seasonality setting that as marketers make quite typical adjustments for seasonal campaign bidding and an optimization score setting that gives an indicator for performance improvement and gives the recommendations for better results.
So, all in all, we’re excited about what’s ahead for PMAX, the further simplification of our products in general, and frankly, the value we can keep driving for business of all sizes, especially when they need it most. Our next question comes from Justin Post of Bank of America. I guess, a follow-up about artificial intelligence. First, CapEx is up 31% year-over-year. Can you talk about a little bit what’s driving that and can that be pulled back a bit? Is that Cloud or really building out the AI capabilities? And then maybe, Sundar, as you think about Search where it is today and you have much better visibility on AI capabilities than we do, how could some of those capabilities be mixed into Search? And when would we as investors maybe see some of those benefits? Thank you. Thanks, Justin. Look, I mean, I think on the AI front, we are still in very early innings. We’ve been very good about, as our research teams are making progress, bringing it into Search so pretty much transformer-based models, including BERT and MUM are in Search now. So it’s driven a massive improvement in Search quality and helped us extend the lead in quality over other products.
We are definitely using it to make it multimodal. And I think going back to some of the earlier questions about making sure Search is visual, things like Google Lens bringing visual search into -- being able to point your phone at things and ask questions, all that really helps set up Search well for the future of where computing is headed.
But AI not only affects search, it affects all our products. It makes YouTube better, ads better, and through Cloud, we are bringing it to other companies as well. So, we’ll keep that in mind. And maybe to -- so we’ll keep that in mind. Thanks. And then maybe, Ruth, on the CapEx, where is most of that going to and how do you think about that going forward? The majority of CapEx does continue to be for our technical infrastructure. And as we’ve talked about on prior calls, servers really has been the largest driver of the investment dollars. The technical infrastructure team has consistently focused on levers to improve utilization and efficiency and they continue to do so.
We are investing, to Sundar’s comments, in building out the compute in support of all that we’re doing with our AI teams and are excited about that. And obviously, you had seen some more activity earlier in the year regarding real estate. We feel good about where we are. We’re continuing to fit out our offices, et cetera, for utilization in this new return to hybrid work environment, but we’re trying to make sure that we’re doing that at an appropriate measured pace, and that’s really it. Thank you very much. Thank you. That concludes our Q&A session. I’d like to turn the conference back to Jim Friedland for closing remarks. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter 2022 call. Thank you, and have a good evening. This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating.

And now, I’ll turn the call over to Sundar. Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. It's clear that after a period of significant acceleration in digital spending during the pandemic, the macroeconomic climate has become more challenging. We continue to have an extraordinary business and provide immensely valuable services for people and our partners.
For example, during the World Cup Final on December 18, Google Search saw its highest query per second volume of all time. And beyond our advertising business, we have strong momentum in Cloud, YouTube subscriptions and hardware.
However, our revenues this quarter were impacted by pullbacks in advertiser spend and the impact of foreign exchange. I'll focus on two major things today in a bit more detail, and then I'll give a shorter-than-usual quarterly snapshot from across our business.
First, how we unlock the incredible opportunities AI enables for consumers, our partners and for our business; and second, how we focus our investments and make necessary decisions as a company to get there.
First, the AI opportunity ahead. AI is the most profound technology we are working on today. Our talented researchers, infrastructure and technology make us extremely well positioned, as AI reaches an inflection point.
More than six years ago, I first spoke about Google being an AI-first company. Since then, we have been a leader in developing AI. In fact, our Transformer’s research project and our field-defining paper in 2017, as well as our path-breaking work in diffusion models are now the basis of many of the generative AI applications you're starting to see today.
Translating these kinds of technical leaps into products that help billions of people is what our company has always thrived on. Everyone working on the various projects underway is excited. We'll pursue this work boldly, but with a deep sense of responsibility, with our AI principles and the highest standards of information integrity at the core of all our work. We have been preparing for this moment since early last year, and you're going to see a lot from us in the coming few months across three big areas of opportunity; first, large models. We published extensively about LaMDA and PoN, the industry's largest, most sophisticated model plus extensive work at DeepMind.
In the coming weeks and months, we'll make these language models available, starting with LaMDA, so that people can engage directly with them. This will help us continue to get feedback, test, and safely improve them. These models are particularly amazing for composing, constructing, and summarizing. They will become even more useful for people as they provide up-to-date more factual information.
And in Search, language models like BERT and MUM have improved searches for four years now, enabling significant ranking improvements and multimodal search like Google Nets. Very soon, people will be able to interact directly with our newest, most powerful language models as a companion to Search in experimental and innovative ways. Stay tuned.
Second, we'll provide new tools and APIs for developers, creators, and partners. This will empower them to innovate and build their own applications and discover new possibilities with AI on top of our language, multimodal, and other AI models.
Third, our AI is a powerful enabler for businesses and organizations of all sizes and we have much more to come here. There's a few flavors of this. Google Cloud is making our technological leadership in AI available to customers via our Cloud AI platform, including infrastructure and tools for developers and data scientists like Vertex AI.
We also offer specific AI solutions for sectors like manufacturing, life sciences and retail and will continue to roll out more. Work space users benefit from AI-powered features like Smart Canvas for collaboration and Smart Compose for creation. And we are working to bring large language models to Gmail and Docs. We'll also make available other helpful generative capabilities from coding to design and more. And for our advertising partners, Philipp will discuss in detail how AI is powering dramatic campaign improvements and value-adding features for them.
Of course, in addition to all this, AI also continues to improve Google's other products dramatically. And we'll continue our work with others outside Google, including joint research collaborations to develop AI responsibly and to apply AI to tackle society's greatest challenges and opportunities.
For example, DeepMind's protein database of all 200 million proteins known to science have now been used by 1 million biologists around the world. We continue to invest in AI across the board, and AI and DeepMind are integral to a bright AI-first future.
Over the past few years, DeepMind has been increasingly working across groups within Google and the other bets and to reflect that progress, we'll be making a financial reporting change that Ruth will share more about in her comments. We are just at the beginning of our AI journey and the best is yet to come.
The second thing I wanted to discuss is our sharpened focus. We are committed to investing responsibly with great discipline and defining areas where we can operate more cost effectively.
We are focused on methodically building financially sustainable, vibrant growing businesses across Alphabet. For example, we are working to improve the economics and hardware as we focus more intently on the Pixel line and our overall cost structure there. Cloud remains very focused on its path to profitability. And there are many opportunities to build on our progress at YouTube over the years, starting with Shorts monetization.
Overall, I see this as an important journey to reengineer the company's cost base in a durable way. There are several dimensions already underway, including prioritization of our product investments across Google and Other Bets. It also includes a careful focus on our hiring needs, reflecting these priorities, as well as efficiencies in our technical infrastructure and productivity improvements from our AI tools.
As part of this, we did a rigorous review across product areas and functions to ensure that our people and roles are aligned with our highest priorities as a company and we announced a reduction in our workforce. I'm grateful to Googlers leaving us for all of their contributions and their hard work to help people and businesses everywhere.
Let me give a few quick updates from across the business this quarter. Just this week, we started bringing revenue sharing to YouTube Shorts, which is now averaging over 50 billion daily views, up from the 30 billion I announced on the Q1 2022 call. This will reward creators and help improve the Shorts experience for everyone.
Our subscription business continues to grow, with YouTube Music and Premium surpassing 80 million subscribers, including trials. Together with YouTube Primetime channel subscriptions and YouTube TV, we have good momentum here. YouTube's NFL Sunday Ticket will accelerate that by helping to drive subscriptions, bring new viewers to YouTube's paid and ad-supported experiences and create new opportunities for creators.
Turning to hardware. Many outlets and reviewers named Pixel 7 Pro, the phone of the year. Features like Magic Eraser and Photo Unblur are incredible and help differentiate Pixel from others. 2022's Pixel 6A, 7 and 7 Pro are the best-selling generation of phones we have ever launched. And we gained share in every market we operate in this year.
Next, Google Cloud. We see continued momentum with Q4 revenue growing 32%. Our differentiated products and focused go-to-market strategy continue to drive customer momentum, bringing with real-time data analytics and AI. Customers are increasingly choosing BigQuery because we unify data lakes, data warehouses and advanced AI/ML into one system and now analyze over 110 terabytes of data per second. Customers like Kroger can analyze data in multiple clouds without moving data in most cases, and MSCI processes unstructured and structured data at scale.
In infrastructure, our global network and an advanced TPU v4 AI supercomputer helped Snap triple the throughput for its business critical ad ranking workload, while significantly lowering cost.
Our machine learning infrastructure with cloud TPU v4 Pods can run large-scale training workloads up to 80% faster than alternatives according to third-party benchmarks, which is helping customers like Bayer accelerate drug discovery. Our reliability advantages and open edge cloud-powered mission-critical 5G network of Telefonica Germany.
As I mentioned, our suite of AI/ML solutions across verticals are a key differentiator. We helped Wells Fargo automate the customer service experience for mobile users and HCA continually improve the quality of patient care. In 2022, Mandiant, which we are now integrating, helped over 1,800 customers prepare for or recover from the most critical cybersecurity incidents.
In Workspace, the innovations mentioned earlier are helping drive new wins and expansions across geographies. In Other Bets, from Calico to Weibo, we are focused on investing sustainably across the portfolio and creating good business. Verily, for example, has recently honed its strategy and structure to more clearly focus its product development.
To close, we are all standing on the cusp of an era of amazing opportunities. We are going to be bold, responsible and focused as we move into it. A healthy disregard for the impossible has been core to our company culture from the very beginning. When I look around Google today, I see that same spirit and energy driving our efforts. Thanks to our employees, our partners and people everywhere who use our services. I'm excited for what's next.
Over to you, Philipp. Thanks, Sundar. Hello, everyone. It's good to be with you all. I'll start today with our Google Services performance in the fourth quarter and then dive deeper into our priority areas. Google Services revenues of $68 billion were down 2% year-on-year, negatively affected by sizable foreign exchange headwind. In Google advertising, Search and Other revenues were down 2% year-over-year, and YouTube Ads and Network had high single-digit revenue declines. Google Other revenues were up 8% year-over-year, with strong growth in YouTube, non-advertising and hardware revenues, offset by a decrease in Play revenues.
I'll highlight two other factors that affected our Ads business in Q4. Ruth will provide more detail. In Search and Other, revenues grew moderately year-over-year, excluding the impact of FX, reflecting an increase in retail and travel, offset partially by a decline in finance. At the same time, we saw further pullback in spend by some advertisers in Search in Q4 versus Q3.
In YouTube and Network, the year-over-year revenue declines were due to a broadening of pullbacks in advertiser spend in the fourth quarter. I'll now zoom out to share more broadly where we're investing and see clear opportunities for long-term growth.
First, Google AI. It's important to recognize that our advertising business has obviously benefited over the past decade from the transition to mobile. More recently, we had outsized growth in advertising revenues during the pandemic, with 2022 advertising revenues $90 billion higher than in 2019.
Going forward, we are focused on growing revenues on top of this higher base through AI-driven innovation. Sundar highlighted the incredible opportunities underway with AI and the transformative impact it will have on businesses. Already, breakthroughs in everything from natural language understanding to generative AI are fueling our ability to deliver results that drive meaningful performance for advertisers and are useful to users.
Take smart bidding, which uses AI to predict future ad conversions and their value, helping businesses stay agile and responsive to rapid shifts in demand. In 2022, AI advances boosted bidding performance, allowing us to move advertiser outcomes down the funnel to drive better ROI and use budgets more efficiently.
In search query matching, large language models like MUM matched advertiser office to user quarries. This understanding of human intent of language, combined with advances in bidding prediction, are why business can see an average of 35% more conversions when they upgrade exact match keywords to broad match in campaigns that use a target CPA.
Google AI also underlies our creative products, like tech suggestions in Google ads and creative optimization and responsive search ads. We're excited to start testing our automatically created assets better, which uses AI to generate headlines and descriptions for search creative seamlessly once advertisers opt in.
Then of course, there's Performance Max, which offers the best combination of our AI-powered systems to our customers. But we're not stopping here, and these examples aren't exhaustive. AI has been foundational to our ads business for the last decade, and we'll continue to bring cutting-edge advances to our products to help businesses and users.
Number two, retail. Our foundation for delivering value over the long term includes three pillars: first, we are on a multi-year mission to make Google a core part of shopping journeys for consumers and a valuable place for merchants to connect with users. This means constantly improving our consumer experiences, starting with a more visual, immersive, browsable search.
Second, we're empowering more merchants to participate in our free listings and ad experiences. In 2022, we saw an uptick in merchants, particularly SMBs and product inventory coming on to Google, adding more value for merchants remains a top priority.
Third, to drive retail performance further, we focus on great ads products, from automation and insights to bidding tools and omnichannel solutions to AI-powered campaigns like PMax, we're helping retailers hit their goals and connect with customers no matter where or when they shop.
Two quick insights on PMax, which we upgraded the majority of advertisers to from smart shopping campaigns last year. First, advertisers on average see a 12% uplift from SSC to PMax. Second, it was a success story during the holidays in Cyber Five, its ability to scale and adapt to changing traffic over a volatile peak retail season drove strong results for many retailers, particularly mid-market advertisers.
Moving on to YouTube. Despite ongoing revenue headwinds in Q4, we're confident in YouTube's long-term trajectory. Here's how we think about our strategy. It all starts with a creator ecosystem. Creators are the lifeblood of YouTube.
In 2022, more people created content on YouTube than ever before, long-form, short-form, audio, podcast, music, live streams. What sets YouTube apart is, we give creators more ways to create content and connect with fans and more ways to earn money than any other platform.
More creators means more content, means more viewers, which leads to more opportunities for advertisers. The creator ecosystem and our multi-format strategy will continue to drive YouTube's long-term growth.
And to support that growth, we're focused on: number one, ramping Shorts; number two, accelerating engagement on a large screen, number three, investing in our subscription offerings; and number four, a long-term effort to make YouTube more shoppable.
First, Shorts. Viewership is growing rapidly, as Sundar said, 50 billion-plus daily views. We're also still pleased with our continuing progress in early monetization. On the creator side, it's been impressive to see the innovative ways creators are using Shorts to introduce their content and extend existing channels.
We're focused on providing creators with the best content creation and monetization tools, new, richer features and analytics capabilities that help individualize and optimize their content strategies. It's early days for Shorts, but we're confident the runway is long.
Next, connected TV, where users are increasingly watching their favorite creators on the big screen at home. According to Nielsen, YouTube is the leader in US streaming watch time. Advertisers are leaning in. With AI-powered solutions, we're helping brands deliver efficient reach and ROI and address pain points like frequency and measurement.
Then there's our subscription offerings. It's clear the future of online video is about helping users seamlessly discover and watch content across ad-supported and premium services. Our goal is to be a one-stop shop for multiple types of video content. That's why we first offered Music and Premium, where 80 million-plus paid subscribers and trialers enjoy their favorite content and music ads-free.
We then expanded into YouTube TV, significantly improving on the legacy television experience. And then last fall, Primetime Channels launched, making streaming subscription services available on YouTube on an à la carte basis.
Given the potential we see in our subscription offerings, we recently announced a multiyear agreement to distribute NFL Sunday Ticket. As Sundar highlighted, we're excited about the opportunities this will open up.
Lastly is our focus on shoppable YouTube. It's still nascent, but we see lots of potential and making it easier for people to shop from the creators, brands, and content they love.
I'll close with something I've said many times before. Our success is only possible because of our customers and partners. The reality is we only do well when they do well. Since our earliest days, our revenue share models have been structured around ROI for our partners from Play developers and online publishers to YouTube creators, artists and media orgs around the world.
Over the last three years, I'm proud to share that we've contributed more than $200 billion to these ecosystems. We remain as committed as ever to fueling the next generation of businesses, media companies and creativity on the web.
On that note, a big thank you to our partners and customers for their ongoing collaboration and trust and to Googlers for their energy, focus, and dedication to helping our users, customers and partners succeed, especially through these tougher times.
Ruth, over to you. Thank you, Philipp. For the full year 2022, Alphabet delivered revenues of $283 billion, up 10% versus 2021 and up 14% on a constant currency basis, adding $37 billion to revenues, excluding the impact of foreign exchange.
I will briefly cover the main points of our fourth quarter results and then turn to our outlook to give you more context for Sundar's comments on how we're focused on investing for growth as well as on reengineering our cost base for long-term success.
For the fourth quarter, our consolidated revenues were $76 billion, up 1% or up 7% in constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth on a constant currency basis. Our total cost of revenues was $35.3 billion, up 7%. Other cost of revenues of $22.4 billion were up 15%. The increase was driven by two factors; first, hardware costs due primarily to $1.2 billion in inventory related charges, and secondarily, to strong unit sales. The charges reflect ongoing pricing pressures and changes in expected future inventory needs.
Second, costs associated with data centers and other operations. Operating expenses were $22.5 billion, up 10%, reflecting an increase in R&D expenses, primarily driven by headcount growth, followed by an increase in G&A expenses, primarily reflecting an increase in charges related to accrued legal matters. These increases were partially offset by a decline in sales and marketing expenses, primarily due to lower advertising and promotional spend.
Operating income was $18.2 billion, down 17% versus last year, and our operating margin was 24%. Net income was $13.6 billion. We delivered free cash flow of $16 billion in the fourth quarter and $60 billion in 2022. We ended the year with $114 billion in cash and marketable securities. We also repurchased a total of $59 billion of our Class A and Class C shares in 2022.
Turning to our segment results, starting with Google Services. Revenues were $67.8 billion, down 2%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $42.6 billion in the quarter were down 2%. Search delivered moderate underlying growth in Q4, absent the impact of currency movements on reported results. YouTube advertising revenues of $8 billion were down 8%. Network advertising revenues of $8.5 billion were down 9%.
Other revenues were $8.8 billion, up 8%, reflecting several factors; first, significant subscriber growth in YouTube Music Premium and YouTube TV; second, strong growth in hardware revenues, primarily from the Pixel family. Offsetting growth in these two areas was a year-on-year decline in Play revenues, reflecting a particularly large foreign exchange headwind in APAC, as well as the impact of reductions of Play Store fees. TAC was $12.9 billion, down 4%. Google Services operating income was $21.1 billion, down 19%, and the operating margin was 31%.
Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $7.3 billion for the quarter, up 32%. Revenue growth in GCP was again greater than Google Cloud, reflecting strength in both infrastructure and platform services. Google Workspace's strong results were driven by increases in both seats and average revenue per seat. In Q4, we saw slower growth of consumption as customers optimized GCP costs, reflecting the macro backdrop. Google Cloud had an operating loss of $480 million. As to our Other Bets, for the full year 2022, revenues were $1.1 billion and the operating loss was $6.1 billion.
Turning to our outlook for the business. In 2022, our year-on-year revenue growth was affected by a number of challenges. First, we faced very tough comps, given the outsized recovery in 2021 from the impact of the pandemic. Second, foreign exchange headwinds grew throughout the year. And third, we were operating against the backdrop of a more challenging economic climate that also impacted many of our customers, and which remains ongoing.
Within Google Services, we are focused on investing in the opportunities we see for long-term revenue growth. First, within advertising, we are focused on using advances in AI to drive new and better experiences for users and search, as well as to deliver better measurement, higher ROI and tools for more compelling creative content to advertisers.
In YouTube, we are prioritizing continued growth in Shorts engagement and monetization, while also working on other initiatives across our ad-supported products. As to our outlook for other revenues, in Play, 2022 results reflected the particularly sizable impact from foreign exchange, lapping the uplift in user activity during the pandemic and the impact from the fee reductions we introduced.
We remain optimistic about the longer term prospects for mobile apps and gaming, although remain more cautious near term, given industry trends. With YouTube subscriptions, we're optimistic about building on its momentum across YouTube Music Premium, YouTube TV and Primetime Channels. In hardware, we continue to make sizable investments, particularly to support innovation across our Pixel family, while working to drive greater focus and cost efficiencies across the portfolio.
For Google Cloud, we remain excited about the long-term market opportunity and the trajectory of the business. Enterprises and governments are increasingly turning to us for their digital transformation initiatives across verticals and geographies. While investing for growth, we remain very focused on Google Cloud's path to profitability.
In terms of Other Bets, as Sundar mentioned, we will be making a financial reporting change as it relates to DeepMind. To reflect the increasing DeepMind collaboration with Google Services, Google Cloud and Other Bets, beginning in the first quarter, DeepMind will no longer be reported in Other Bets and will be reported as part of Alphabet's corporate costs.
I'll now walk you through the key elements of our efforts to deliver a durable reengineering of our cost base in order to slow the pace of operating expense growth. We expect the impact will become more visible in 2024. First, with respect to Alphabet headcount, we are meaningfully slowing the pace of hiring in 2023, while still investing in priority areas. In Q4, we added 3,455 people. As in prior quarters, the majority of hires were for technical roles.
With respect to our recent announcement that we are reducing our workforce by approximately 12,000 roles, most of the impact will be seen in Q1. We will take a severance charge of $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion, which will be reported in corporate costs. We will continue hiring in priority areas with a particular focus on top engineering and technical talent as well as on the global footprint of our talent.
Second, we have a longer term effort underway to reengineer our cost base in three broad categories; first, using AI and automation to improve productivity across Alphabet for operational tasks, as well as the efficiency of our technical infrastructure; second, managing our spend with suppliers and vendors more effectively; and third, optimizing how and where we work.
In the first quarter of 2023, we expect to incur approximately $500 million of costs related to exiting leases to align our office space with our adjusted global headcount look. This will be reflected in corporate costs. We will continue to optimize our real estate footprint.
Turning to CapEx. For 2023, we expect total CapEx to be generally in line with 2022, with an increase in technical infrastructure versus a decline in office facilities. Our ongoing investment in technical infrastructure is obviously a critical component of supporting our long-term growth opportunities.
Finally, I will point you to our earnings release in which we noted that we adjusted the estimated useful lives of servers and certain network equipment starting in Q1 2023. We expect these changes will favorably impact our 2023 operating results by approximately $3.4 billion for assets and service as of year-end 2022.
Thank you. Sundar, Philipp and I will now take your questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two, the first one around AI and sort of the cost of AI. I appreciate all the color about all the AI tools that are to come. I guess, first question is, how should we think about the potential impact on CapEx and the higher compute intensity of these AI tools to come, potentially impacting margins over the next couple of years?
And then the second one, Ruth, I really appreciate the conversation about long-term efforts underway to improve efficiency. How should we think about potential impacts of those efforts in 2023 and in 2024? Have you sort of run any sizes of what types of savings we could see roll through the P&L over that period? Thanks. Thanks for the question. So starting on your question about AI and CapEx. As I think Sundar and Philipp both noted, AI is already incorporated in many of our products, products like Performance Max and Smart Bidding and Cloud, as Sundar said. It is more compute-intensive, but also opens up many more services and products for our users, for creators, for advertisers.
That being said, we're very focused on further optimizing the cost of compute, and that's across all elements, data center, servers and our supply chain. So we're continuing to invest with a keen lens on the return on that capital.
And as I indicated in opening comments, when we look at CapEx for 2023, we do expect it's going to be generally in line with 2022 with an important mix shift. We're increasing our investments in technical infrastructure. And that's not just for AI. That's to support investments across Alphabet, in particular in Cloud as well. And at the same time, we're meaningfully decreasing our CapEx for office facilities.
And then, with respect to the overall efficiency opportunities, yes, very keen focus on the three areas that I noted, the -- and one of the key elements of it is using AI and automation to improve productivity and efficiency of our technical infrastructure.
We noted that we want to be focused and that we are focused on durable improvements to our expense base. And that's because if you go through the items, the work streams that we have in flight, they take longer to implement, execute. They're in process now, and they continue to build on themselves and continue to provide added upside as we go through time, which is why I indicated you would see more of an impact on 2024 than in 2023. But we're continuing to work through them. Great. Thanks, Ruth. And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Thanks. I have two. For Sundar and Philipp, you both mentioned the NFL in your remarks and the opportunities it opens up. Can you comment and help us define, what do you see is that longer-term opportunity? Why is it so critical to have the NFL? Is this the first of many sports deals to be had? So anything just help us, why this is so important to you? And then just, Philipp, you've said in the past about the scaling of monetization, YouTube Shorts. What are the sticky factors? What's taking you the time to really bring advertisers on? I wonder some of the things you've seen in terms that you've solved to make this a more quickly monetizable product? Thank you. Yeah. Thank you so much for the question. We think there is a lot of great opportunities to differentiate the user and creator experience, with our unique capabilities. It basically means that, every YouTube viewer, who is interested in the NFL can now have one-click access to the full offering of Sunday Ticket, as an add-on package on YouTube TV subscription, and as a stand-alone offering on Primetime Channels. This will be the first time that Sunday Ticket is actually available a la carte for fans.
On YouTube TV, we're building the ability for subscribers to, for example, watch multiple screens at once. And on YouTube CTV, we'll be adding new features specific to the Sunday Ticket experience like comments, chats, polls, and so on. On the creator side, imagine all the innovative ways they can create with exclusive NFL content, behind-the-scenes event access and so on. And we're really excited to see, what they'll do across long-form, shorts, live streams and more.
On your second question, on the Shorts side, as I said earlier, viewership is growing rapidly, 50 billion-plus daily views, up from 30 billion last spring. We're still pleased with our continuing progress in monetization. Closing the gap between Shorts and long-form is a big priority for us, as is, of course, continuing to build a great creator and user experience, which we're paying a lot of attention to.
As on Shorts are now available, it gives you a bit of a sign for the progress. We have video action, app discovery, Performance Max campaigns and via product feed shorts are also shoppable. And again, we're the only destination where creators can produce all forms of content, across multiple formats, across multiple screens and really with multiple ways to make a living. And Sundar shared just yesterday, we brought revenue sharing to Shorts via our YouTube Partner Program. Ultimately, our goal is to make YouTube the best place for Shorts and creators. And that's really what our focus is at the moment. And our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Thanks for taking the questions. One for Sundar and one for Ruth. For Sundar, can you just talk more about how you can bring the AI products to market with the principles and integrity that you talked about and how you can do that without kind of sacrificing quality or trust along the way?
And then, Ruth, clearly, the language around reengineering the cost structure in a durable way and everything that went along with it is different than what we've heard in the past. Is there any way at all to help us quantify how you're thinking about these efforts? Thanks. Thanks, Doug. On the AI side, it is a really exciting time. I think we've been investing for a while, and it's clear that the market is ready. Consumers are interested in trying out new experiences. I think I feel comfortable with all the investments we have made in making sure we can develop AI responsibly. And we'll be careful.
We'll be launching -- we’ll -- more as labs products in certain cases, beta features in certain cases and just slowly scaling up from there. Obviously, we need to make sure we're iterating in public, these models will keep getting better, so the field is fast changing. The serving costs will need to be improved.
So I view it as very, very early days, but we are committed to putting our experiences, both in terms of new products and experiences, actually bringing direct LLM experiences in Search, making APIs available for developers and enterprises and learn from there and iterate like we've always done. So I'm looking forward to it. And then on your second question, when we talk about being focused on delivering sustainable financial value, that obviously means that expense growth cannot be growing ahead of revenue growth. And we're focused on revenue upside, as well as durable changes to the expense base to really ensure we have the capacity to invest in that growth.
And clearly, the emphasis of revenue growth, there's a lot that's exciting ahead of us within Google Services, all of the AI advancements that are improving advertiser ROI and the search user experience. And more broadly, as we've talked about across the key product areas.
And then very importantly, on expense growth, we have a very strong commitment to, we can’t keep emphasizing, durably reengineer our cost base, and that will benefit all of the segments across Alphabet.
And the key components, slowing the pace of hiring as a starting point, product prioritization across Google, as Sundar said, is key, improving economics in hardware as we focus intently on the Pixel line and cost structure, then using AI and automation to improve productivity for operational tasks, as well as for the efficiency of our technical infrastructure, where we have a number of work streams.
Managing our spend, as I said, with suppliers and vendors and then optimizing how and where we work, and you saw part of that with the real estate consolidation, given the slower headcount growth.
All of those not only benefit Google Services, but many of those similarly drive greater efficiency across Alphabet. And so, as we've said, in Cloud, we remain very focused on the path to profitability. That's a revenue and margin driver. And then with Other Bets, we're similarly focused on investing sustainably.
And so, to go back to it, it's the durable nature of change in some of the elements that I've talked about here where work is ongoing, you start to see impacting in 2023 but to really get full year run rate and the benefit of it, there is work ongoing. And that's why we've emphasized this notion of it comes in and then really you see the run rate in 2024. That’s helpful. Thank you, both. Our next question is from Eric Sheridan of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Thank you so much. Maybe two, if I could. Sundar, for you, continuing on the AI theme, how do you think philosophically about capturing the opportunity set that you see in front of you, given all the investments you've made over the last five-plus years that we've been talking about going back to a lot of Google I/Os versus potentially disrupt the user experience or the monetization arc in your existing product set and striking the right balance between the opportunity set and being disruptive to yourself when you think about looking forward over the next couple of years?
And then, Ruth, maybe just following on some of the questions and debates on the cost structure. Obviously, Other Bets is an area where the losses continue to be sort of higher than what some of us think from the outside looking in. But then you showed some improvement in the losses in the Cloud division this quarter. How should we be thinking about the rationalization of the cost structure and aligning costs with opportunity sets across some of the divisions of Alphabet when you think for the medium to long term? Thanks so much. Thanks, Eric. Look, I do think, first of all, we made such a foundational technology and we've been investing not just in terms of research, but actually getting it all production scale-ready. We had already deployed. If you look at the impact, things like BERT and MUM had on search quality, making search multi-modal, driving the usage of products like Google Lens. I feel like we've been scaling up well.
In Google Cloud today with Vertex AI, we'd already been bringing AI APIs to enterprises, and they're on a pretty healthy growth path. So we do see secular opportunities ahead, both in terms of putting these APIs out, making sure every developer, every organization in the world can use it. And as I said earlier, we are in very, very early days and I think there's a lot of room ahead.
In terms of Search too, now that we can integrate more direct LLM type experiences in Search, I think it will help us expand and serve new types of use cases, generative use cases. And so I think I see this as a chance to rethink and re-imagine and drive Search to solve more use cases for our users as well. So again, early days, you will see us be bold, put things out, get feedback and iterate and make things better. And then in terms of your question about Other Bets investment levels, so as we've talked about in prior calls, our goal for Other Bets is to use our deep technology investments to drive innovation with real potential for value creation. And at the same time, we are very focused on the overall pace of investment and the financial returns. And so what we're really looking at here are what are the opportunities for monetization and commercialization. As I've said on prior calls, there is no monolithic approach across the portfolio, but we are very focused on whether – what's the pace of investment opportunities for monetization and commercialization.
And just a bit more with respect to the DeepMind move, to be very clear, we consolidate in Other Bets into Google only when that bet supports products and services within Google or for Alphabet broadly. And you saw us do that, some time ago when we moved Chronicle as an example into combining with our Cloud business and really the cybersecurity offering that is now in Cloud, and that was very effective.
With AI, this is obviously an Alphabet strategic priority, and we see huge opportunity ahead, and DeepMind's research is core to that future across the product areas in Alphabet portfolio. And so this reporting change reflects the strategic focus in DeepMind, the support of each one of our segments, and that's why I indicated that beginning Q1, DeepMind financials will be reported within our corporate cost segment. Thanks so much. Our next question is from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Thank you for taking my question. Just digging into Search, low single-digit growth ex-FX. Can you talk about the pressures there, volume versus pricing or CPCs? What's really driving the slowdown? It's almost back to 2009 recession levels. Just think about that. And then any signs that we're near a bottom? Any stabilization in growth rates you can talk about or how your outlook is for 2023 on that? Thank you. So overall, as we've indicated, we remain very excited about all that we're doing in Search, the utility for all of us. And so that's why you've heard so many comments about the application of AI and what that means for the ongoing opportunity. You had a number of different questions in there. I think one was on volumes. In the 10-K that we'll be filing shortly, you'll see that for the full year 2022, CPCs were down 1% versus last year. And as we've talked about in prior quarters, the change in CPCs can reflect a number of different factors; geographic mix, property mix, all sorts of things. Clicks were up 10% in 2022, reflecting a number of factors, including increased engagement, primarily on mobile devices and improvements in ad formats.
But I think overall, we're really excited about what we see ahead. We're not going to predict the global environment. We did say the challenging backdrop is ongoing, and you can see that but we're very focused on what we can control. And I think most important and what we're really excited about here is innovation to help advertisers overall and our cost reengineering that really gets us to align this long-term sustainable value creation. Thank you. Our next question is from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Your line is open. Yeah. Just a question on the hardware business. Pixel's doing quite well, but it seems like there have been issues around other areas with this inventory write-down. So could maybe you guys just talk about, in your mind, the strategic importance of having the wide range of hardware products that you have in that segment as it relates to your overall AI initiatives? Thanks a lot. Thanks, Ross. First of all, very, very pleased with how Pixel has performed through a challenging macro environment. Look, I think our computing portfolio is incredibly important. It's what allows us to -- for us to invest and drive innovation forward. You have to put it all together as a product and ship it. And I think it ends up playing a very, very big role in guiding the ecosystem as well.
And increasingly, I think users are thinking beyond phones and thinking through a holistic ecosystem. To give one example, us undertaking Pixel Watch and, as part of that, integrating Fitbit and bringing it to our ecosystem as well, partnering closely with Samsung on wearables. The combination is what has driven over a 300% increase in actives on Android watches ecosystem.
So, just to give you a context on that. So, we are very thoughtful about how we are approaching this area. And as Ruth mentioned, across all these areas, too, we are working to drive greater focus and cost efficiencies in the portfolio.
Obviously, we work through a challenging supply chain environment as well as a challenging environment on the demand side. And so we'll continue focusing on improving all of this in a durable way. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Hey I'll just ask one question on, Ruth, you mentioned a couple of times, getting Google Cloud to profitability. And just talk through how that gets done. You had almost 40% growth in Google Cloud. The operating loss level stayed about the same from 2021 to 2022, so the growth is there.
What are the factors that need to be solved in order to get pretty nice profitability out of that segment sort of anywhere akin to what Azure and AWS have been able to show over the years? Thank you. Thanks for the question. So, as we've talked about on prior calls, with Google Cloud, we've really been investing ahead of our revenues, given the growth and the opportunity overall and the desire to ensure that we're equipped, able to support customers across segments around the globe. And so there's been meaningful investment to position ourselves to really have the momentum that the team has continued to deliver.
That being said, they are, as both Sundar and I have noted, extremely focused on the path to profitability in every element of that and some of the items that I noted that benefit Alphabet generally most certainly are relevant here for Cloud as well, everything from our efficiency with our technical infrastructure, which we're very excited about, all the efforts that they're doing there and more broadly.
So, this has been really to ensure, first and foremost, given the scale of the opportunity and the speed with which it's moving that we're positioned to be present with our customers, to provide them with the analytics, the skills, the capabilities that are needed to build for long-term growth.
And we're at a position now where we've meaningfully closed the gap to profitability but still are working through as we continue to invest for growth while narrowing what this is on our march to profitability. Thank you, Ruth. And our last question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is open. Good afternoon, Ruth, can you give us a sense of what you're seeing in Q1? Is this year a little more seasonal than historic? Are you observing any different patterns just over one month into of the year? Can you give us any color in terms of how you're framing this quarter? So I think as you know well, we don't tend to -- we don't provide exit run rates. What we tried to do is give you the context within which we're approaching the overall business and the priorities that we have as we're looking at revenue upside and the growth levers there as well as how to reengineer our expense base to deliver attractive returns. So not really much to add to the comments that you've heard today, and we're continuing to execute across each one of the elements we discussed. Thank you. Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any further remarks. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter 2023 call. Thank you, and have a good evening. Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.","the fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call will be held in a listen-only mode . a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release . it's clear that after a period of significant acceleration in digital spending during the pandemic, the macroeconomic climate has become more challenging.",1.0

Thank you for standing by for the Alphabet First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Alphabet’s first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler and Ruth Porat.
Now I will quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations and financial performance maybe considered forward-looking and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC.
During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today’s earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. Our comments will be on year-over-year comparisons unless we state otherwise.
And now, I will turn the call over to Sundar. Thank you, Jim and good afternoon everyone. I am pleased with our business performance in the first quarter with Search performing well and momentum in Cloud. We introduced important product updates anchored in deep computer science and AI. Our North Star is providing the most helpful answers for our users and we see huge opportunities ahead, continuing our long track record of innovation. On Cloud, we continue to be on a long and exciting journey to build that business. Cloud delivered profitability this quarter and we remain focused on long-term value creation here.
Today, I will give an update on the two themes I spoke about last quarter: one, our advancements in AI and how they are driving opportunities in Search and beyond; and two, our efforts to sharpen our focus as a company. Then I will talk about our momentum in Cloud and close with our progress at YouTube.
First, the incredible AI opportunity for consumers, our partners and for our business. I’ve compared it to the successful transition we made from desktop to mobile computing over a decade ago. Our investments and breakthroughs in AI over the last decade have positioned us well. In our last call, I outlined three areas of opportunity: continuing to develop state-of-the-art large language models and make significant improvements across our products to be more helpful to our users; empowering developers, creators and partners with our tools; and enabling organizations of all sizes to utilize and benefit from our AI advances.
We have made good progress across all three areas. In March, we introduced our experimental conversational AI service called Bard. We have since added our PaLM model to make it even more powerful and Bard can now help people with programming and software development tasks, including code generation, lots more to come. For developers, we have released our PaLM API alongside our new MakerSuite tool. It provides a simple way to access our large language models and begin building new generative AI applications quickly.
A number of organizations are using our generative AI large language models across Google Cloud platform, Google Workspace and our cybersecurity offerings. For years, we’ve been focused on making Search even more helpful from Google Lens to multi-Search to visual exploration in Search, immersive view in Maps, Google Translate, to all the language models powering Search today, we have used AI to open up access to knowledge in powerful ways. We’ll continue to incorporate generative AI advances to make Search better in a thoughtful and deliberate way. We’ll be guided by data and years of experience about what people want and our high standards for quality. And we’ll test and iterate as we go because we know that billions of people trust Google to provide the right information. As it evolves, we’ll unlock entirely new experiences in Search and beyond just as camera, voice and translation technologies have all opened entirely new categories of queries and exploration.
AI has also been foundational to our ads business for over a decade. Products like Performance Max used the full power of Google’s AI to help advertisers find untapped an incremental conversion opportunities. Philipp will talk more about this in a moment. And as we continue to bring AI to our products, our AI principles and the highest standards of information integrity remain at the core of all our work. As one example, our perspective API helps to identify and reduce the amount of toxic text that language models train on with significant benefits for information quality. This is designed to help ensure the safety of generative AI applications before they are released to the public.
We are proud to have world-class research teams who have been advancing the breakthroughs underpinning this new era of AI. Last week, I announced that we are bringing together the Brain Team in Google Research and DeepMind into one unit. Combining all this talent into 1 focused team, backed by the pooled computational resources of Google, will help accelerate our progress and develop the most capable AI systems safely and responsibly.
On to my second theme, the company’s sharpened focus. I spoke last quarter about our commitment to invest responsibly and with discipline and to find areas where we can operate more cost effectively and with greater velocity. We have significant multiyear efforts underway to create savings, such as improving machine utilization and finding more scalable and efficient ways to train and serve machine learning models. We are making our data centers more efficient, redistributing workloads and equipment where servers aren’t being fully used. This is important work as we continue to significantly invest in infrastructure to drive our many AI opportunities. Improving external procurement is another area where data suggests significant savings, and this work is underway. And we are taking concrete steps to manage our real estate portfolio to ensure it meets our current and future needs. We’ll continue to use data to determine additional areas for durable savings.
Next, Google Cloud. I’m pleased with the ongoing momentum in Cloud. Our disciplined expansion of our product road map and go-to-market organization has helped to build one of the largest enterprise software companies in the world. We have consistently grown top line revenues and improved annual operating margins, and we continue to do so this quarter. Our growth has come from our deep relationships with large enterprises, a strong partner ecosystem and our product leadership. Over the past 3 years, GCP’s annual deal volume has grown nearly 500%, with large deals over $250 million growing more than 300%. Nearly 60% of the world’s 1,000 largest companies are Google Cloud customers, and many leading start-ups and millions of small and medium enterprises use Google Cloud.
We have also built a strong partner ecosystem. Over the last 4 years, the number of Google Cloud Partner certified practitioners around the world has increased more than 15x. The largest global system integrators have built 13 dedicated practices with Google Cloud compared to zero when we started. And today, more than 100,000 companies are part of our Google Cloud Partner Advantage program. Our growth is also driven by our product leadership. We are bringing our generative AI advances to our cloud customers across our cloud portfolio. Our PaLM generative AI models and Vertex AI platform are helping Behavox to identify insider threats, [indiscernible] to test its autonomous vehicles and Lightricks to quickly develop text-to-image features.
In Workspace, our new generative AI features are making content creation and collaboration even easier for customers like Standard Industries and Lyft. This builds on our popular AI Bard Workspace tools, Smart Canvas and Translation Hub used by more than 9 million paying customers. Our product leadership also extends to data analytics, which provides customers the ability to consolidate their data and understand it better using AI. New advances in our data cloud enable Ulta Beauty to scale new digital and omnichannel experiences while focusing on customer loyalty; Shopify to bring better search results and personalization using AI; and Mercedes Benz to bring new products to market more quickly. We have introduced generative AI to identify and prioritize cyber threats, automate security workflows and response and help scale cybersecurity teams. Our cloud cybersecurity products helped protect over 30,000 companies, including innovative brands like Broadcom and Europe’s Telepass. We are successfully integrating Mandiant with our products, including Mandiant Threat Intelligence and Breach Analytics.
Our open approach to AI development, coupled with our industry-leading TPUs and best-in-class GPUs from NVIDIA, enable innovative companies to tackle any AI workload with speed and flexibility. AI21 Labs, Replit, Midjourney and many others build and train foundation models and generative AI platforms. We are the only cloud provider to announce availability of NVIDIA’s new L4 Tensor Core GPU with the launch of our G2 VMs, which are purpose-built for large inference AI workloads, such as generative AI.
Turning next to YouTube, let me start by thanking Susan Wojcicki for her terrific leadership of YouTube for 9 years. She recently transitioned into an advisory role with Alphabet this quarter with Neal Mohan, a long-time leader at Google and YouTube, becoming the new head of YouTube.
Here are a few highlights from the quarter. YouTube Shorts continues to see strong momentum with Creators. Last year, the number of channels that uploaded to Shorts daily grew over 80%. Those posting weekly on Shorts, saw the majority of new channel subscribers coming from their Shorts post. The living room remained our fastest-growing screen in 2022 in terms of watch time, and we are seeing growth and momentum internationally.
On our subscription business, we rolled out several new updates to YouTube Premium. Premium subscribers can now queue videos on phones and tablets, stream continuously while switching between devices and auto download recommended videos for off-line viewing. And we have great momentum around YouTube TV and YouTube Primetime channels. We have announced pricing for the NFL Sunday Ticket offering, which will help to drive subscriptions, bring new viewers to YouTube’s paid and ad-supported experiences and create new opportunities for Creators.
To close across the company, we are excited about helping people, businesses and society reach their full potential with AI. We’ll share updates at Google I/O about how we are using AI across our products including our Pixel devices and share some exciting new developments for Android. Thanks to our employees around the world who continue to work hard to advance our mission. After nearly 25 years, the work to organize the world’s information and make it accessible and useful is as ever, and I look forward to the work ahead.
Over to you, Philipp. Thanks, Sundar and hey everyone. It’s great to be here today. I’ll kick off with Google Services’ performance in the first quarter, then provide color into our key opportunity areas and then turn it over to Ruth for more on our financial performance.
Google Services revenue of $62 billion were up 1% year-on-year, including the effect of a modest foreign exchange headwind. In Google Advertising, Search and Other, revenues grew 2% year-over-year, reflecting an increase in the travel and retail verticals, offset partially by a decline in finance as well as in media and entertainment. In YouTube Ads, we saw signs of stabilization and performance, while in network, there was an incremental pullback in advertiser spend. Google Other revenues were up 9% year-over-year, led by strong growth in YouTube subscriptions revenues.
Now let’s double-click into the 3 areas I laid out last quarter, where we see clear opportunities for long-term growth in advertising. Number one, Google AI; number two, retail, which cuts across all of our ads products and services; and number three, YouTube. First, Google AI. I’ve said before, AI has long been an important driver of our business. Advancements are powering our ability to help businesses, big and small, respond in real time to rapidly changing market and consumer shifts and deliver measurable ROI when it’s needed most. In Q1, we continue to innovate across our products. Take Core Search, for example. In targeting, we updated search keyword relevance using the latest natural language AI from MUM models to improve the relevance and performance of shown ads when there are multiple overlapping keywords eligible for an auction. In bidding, we improved our Smart Bidding models to bid more accurately based on differences in search ad formats. In other words, bid more effectively depending on how a user wants to engage with an ad. In creatives, we opened our automatically created assets beta to all advertisers in English. ACA generates text assets alongside your responsive search ads and uses AI to help reduce the amount of manual work to keep creatives fresh and relevant to users’ query, context and to the advertisers business.
To then unlock Core Search further and maximize conversions across all of Google, we’re actively helping more advertisers pair together with Performance Max. Advertisers who use PMax are, on average, achieving over 18% more conversions at a similar CPA. This is up 5 points in just 14 months, thanks to advances in the AI underlying bidding, creatives, search query matching and new formats like YouTube Shorts.
I mentioned earlier that travel was a contributor to growth. In March, we launched PMax for Travel Goals. Now even the smallest total DS can benefit from the expanded reach of hotel ads in PMax. Like family-run Corissia Hotels Group, who drove a 32% increase in revenue and a 26% increase in total direct bookings within just 1 month of using PMax for travel goals, there’s more to come here as we add even more AI part features. Stay tuned for more at Google Marketing Live in May.
Moving on to retail, where we had a solid quarter. Our focus is on three pillars: number one, making Google a core part of shopping journeys for consumers and a valuable place for merchants to connect with users. Number two, empowering more merchants to participate in our free listings and ads experiences; and number three, driving retail performance further with great ads products.
In a macro environment of do more with less, our tools and solutions are proving that we can deliver value for retailers online and omnichannel and drive high-value customers even in challenging times. Caraway, a direct-to-consumer maker of cookware, use target ROAS to uncapped budgets and PMax to optimize and deploy spend across Google inventory for its Q4 Black Friday campaign. PMax drove a 46% increase in revenue and 31% jump in ROAS leading to Caraway’s best business day in history and a robust reinvestment in its AI-first strategy for Q1.
For omni-focused retailers, we recently rolled out store sales reporting and bidding in Performance Max for store goals. This is helping retailers go beyond just optimizing to online conversions to also optimize to their stores, reaching and bidding for high-value customers who are more likely to spend in store. Danish Department Store, Magazine, recently used our store sales solution to boost its omnichannel ROAS 128% versus online-only campaigns. Thanks to dynamic in-store values coming from its first-party data, including its high-value customers, magazine can now, with confidence, measure the full impact of its online investments on both e-commerce and physical store revenue.
Turning to YouTube. Creators fuel YouTube success. Across Long Form and Shorts, Music and Podcasts, Vertical and Horizontal, YouTube is where creators are incentivized to make their best work, which means the best content, more of yours and more opportunities for advertisers. As I said last quarter, our creator ecosystem and multi-format strategy will be key drivers of YouTube’s long-term growth. And to support this growth, we’re focused on, number one, Shorts; number two, engagement on CTV; number three, investing in our subscription offerings; and number four, a longer-term effort to make YouTube more shoppable.
First, Shorts. We’re seeing strong watch time growth. Monetization is also progressing nicely. People are engaging and converting on ads across Shorts at increasing rates. Number two, connected TV. As Sundar said we are seeing momentum globally. Viewers love watching YouTube creators and their favorite content on the large screen. Advertisers are leaning in.
Zooming out more broadly for a second. Across YouTube, we’re helping brands benefit from our expansive reach and drive the profitability they are looking for. In one of our largest marketing mix modeling studies to date, YouTube ROI is 40% higher than linear TV and 34% higher than all other online video, according to a customer analysis from January 2020 to March 2022 of Nielsen Compass ROI benchmarks across 16 countries and 19 billion of total media spend measured. This proves YouTube’s ability to drive effectiveness at scale.
Next up are subscription offerings. The goal is to be a one-stop shop for multiple types of video content across both ad-supported and Premium services. Our launch of MultiView on YouTube TV and our first-of-its-kind a la carte access for NFL Sunday Ticket are two examples of how we’re investing here. Expect more updates over the coming quarters.
Number four, shopping on YouTube. It’s still super early days. One highlight. Last year, we brought shopping to more creators and brands by partnering with commerce platforms like Shopify. Now more than 100,000 creators, artists and brands have connected their own stores to their YouTube channels to sell their products. We’re excited about the potential ahead.
I’ll close with an awesome example of we’re bringing the best across Google to our partners to accelerate innovation. Mercedes-Benz, in February, we announced a first-of-a-kind partnership to bring Google Maps platform and YouTube into future Mercedes-Benz vehicles, equipped with its next-gen MBOS operating system. Beyond enabling the luxury automaker to design a customized navigation interface, we will also provide AI and data cloud capabilities to advance their autonomous driving efforts and create an enhanced customer experience.
On that note, a big thank you, first, to our customers and partners for their trust and collaboration; and second, to all Googlers for all of their incredible work this quarter. Ruth, over to you. Thank you, Philipp. Our financial results for the first quarter reflect continued healthy fundamental growth in search and momentum in Cloud. As I go through the discussion today, I will reference some changes to our reporting and disclosures that are covered more fully in the 8-K we filed last week. I will conclude with our outlook.
For the first quarter, our consolidated revenues were $69.8 billion, up 3% or up 6% in constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth on a constant currency basis. In terms of expenses and profitability, year-on-year comparisons are impacted by three factors: first, the $2.6 billion in charges we took in the first quarter related to workforce and office space reductions. We provided a table in our earnings release that shows the impact of those charges on cost of revenues and operating expenses. Second, the adjustment we made to the estimated useful lives of servers and certain network equipment at the beginning of 2023. As you can see in our earnings release, the effect for the first quarter was a reduction in depreciation expense of $988 million. Third, the shift in timing of our annual employee stock-based compensation awards from January to March delays the step-up in SBC from Q1 to Q2. This shift in timing does not affect the total amount of SBC over the full year 2023.
Total cost of revenues was $30.6 billion, up 3%, driven by other cost of revenues of $18.9 billion, which was up 7%. The biggest factor of which was compensation costs associated with data centers and other operations and followed by content acquisition costs. Operating expenses were $21.8 billion, up 19%, with a significant impact from the charges related to workforce and office space reductions. Operating income was $17.4 billion, down 13%, and our operating margin was 25%. Net income was $15.1 billion. We delivered free cash flow of $17.2 billion in the first quarter and $62 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with $115 billion in cash and marketable securities.
Turning to our segment results. These were affected by two additional changes outlined in our 8-K filing. First, reflecting the increasing collaboration between DeepMind and Google Services, Google Cloud and Other Bets. As of Q1, DeepMind is reported as part of Alphabet’s unallocated corporate costs. And second, beginning in the first quarter, we updated our cost allocation methodologies to provide our business leaders with increased transparency for decision-making. In our filing, we provided a recast of prior period results for the segment for these two changes. The highlights of the year-on-year performance of our segments that I will review reflect these recast results.
Starting with Google Services. Revenues were $62 billion, up 1%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $40.4 billion in the quarter were up 2%. YouTube advertising revenues of $6.7 billion were down 3%. Network advertising revenues of $7.5 billion were down 8%. Other revenues were $7.4 billion, up 9%, reflecting primarily ongoing significant subscriber growth in YouTube TV and YouTube Music Premium. TAC was $11.7 billion, down 2%, primarily reflecting a mix shift between search and Network. Google Services operating income was $21.7 billion, down 1%, and the operating margin was 35%.
Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $7.5 billion for the quarter, up 28%. Growth in GCP remained strong across geographies, industries and products. Google Workspace’s strong results were driven by increases in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had operating income of $191 million, and the operating margin was 2.6%. As to our Other Bets, for the first quarter, revenues were $288 million, and the operating loss was $1.2 billion.
Turning to our outlook for the business. In terms of the operating environment, our results in the first quarter reflected ongoing headwinds due to a challenging economic environment and the outlook remains uncertain. Foreign exchange headwinds have moderated, and we expect less of a foreign exchange headwind in the second quarter based on current spot rates. With respect to Google Services, within advertising, Q1 results reflect the resilience of search with its unique ability to surface demand and deliver measurable ROI. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, the revenue growth of search was similar to last quarter. In YouTube, we saw signs of stabilization in ad spend on a sequential basis. We continue to prioritize growth in Shorts engagement where we are encouraged by progress in monetization. As to other revenues, in YouTube subscriptions, we are pleased with the significant ongoing subscriber growth in both YouTube Music Premium and YouTube TV. In Play, revenues were down year-on-year, primarily due to the continued impact of foreign exchange in APAC, although results have improved as we lapped the impact from our introduction of fee reductions last year.
Turning to Google Cloud. Our investments in product innovation, our go-to-market organization and our partner ecosystem delivered strong results as customers across industries and geographies increasingly rely on Google Cloud to digitally transform their businesses. That being said, in Q1, we continued to see slower growth of consumption as customers optimized GCP costs reflecting the macro backdrop, which remains uncertain. In terms of operating performance, we remain focused on driving long-term profitable growth in Cloud, while continuing to invest given the substantial opportunity.
Moving to Other Bets. In the first quarter, we similarly worked to refine strategies and prioritize efforts across the portfolio, including reductions to headcount. I will now walk you through an update on our efforts to reengineer our cost base, slowing the pace of operating expense growth while creating capacity for key investment areas, particularly in support of AI across the company. First, as discussed on the fourth quarter call, we have efforts underway in three broad categories; number one, using AI and automation to improve productivity across Alphabet for operational tasks as well as the efficiency of our technical infrastructure; number two, managing our spend with suppliers and vendors more effectively; and number three, continuing to optimize how and where we work. As we’ve noted previously, all three work streams are ramping up this year, and we plan to build on these efforts in 2024 and in subsequent years.
Second, with respect to headcount growth. The reported number of employees at the end of the first quarter includes almost all of the employees impacted by the workforce reduction we announced in January. We expect most of the impacted individuals will no longer be reflected in our head count by the end of the second quarter. In terms of the outlook for headcount for the year, as we shared last quarter, we are meaningfully slowing the pace of hiring in 2023, while still investing in priority areas, particularly for top engineering and technical talent.
In terms of our investments in AI, we are excited about the creation of Google DeepMind, combining the Brain Team from Google Research with DeepMind with the goal to accelerate innovation and impact. Beginning in the second quarter of 2023, the costs associated with teams and activities transferred from Google Research will move from Google Services to Google DeepMind within Alphabet’s unallocated corporate costs.
Finally, as it relates to CapEx, for 2023, we now expect total CapEx to be modestly higher than in 2022. As discussed last quarter, CapEx this year will include a meaningful increase in technical infrastructure versus a decline in office facilities. We expect the pace of investment in both data center construction and servers to step up in the second quarter and continue to increase throughout the year.
Thank you. Sundar, Philipp and I will now take your questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. First one for Sundar. Sundar, I guess as you think over the course of the next 12 months, I know you have a lot of new AI tools to show us, what new behavior changes or capabilities are you most excited about for users, developers and advertisers as these tools come out? And then the second one for Ruth. Could you talk to us about how much of the AI tools have you incorporated internally to sort of drive more productivity out of your engineers, your sales force, your G&A? Or is that sort of something to come over the next couple of years? Thanks. Thanks, Brian. It is an exciting time. I do think we see an opportunity to – across the breadth of what we do at Google to improve our experiences. Obviously, in search, we’ve been using AI for a while. It’s what has really helped lead search and search quality for the past few years using LLMs. We now have a chance to more natively use LLMs. And I think, I think the main way – and by the way, as I said in my remarks, we are going to be deliberate. We’re going to – our North Star is getting it right for users. So we will iterate and innovate as we’ve always done. The main area maybe I’m excited by is we do know from experience that users come back to search, they follow-on. They are engaging back on stuff they already did. And so for us, to use LLMs in a way we can serve those use cases better, I think it’s a real opportunity. Obviously, if it’s YouTube, the chance to really improve experiences for creators and consumers in terms of how the videos are viewed, etcetera, I think you can expect changes. Workspace, we already have changes rolling out, and it’s an area where I think we will see the biggest advances because I think productivity is a strong use case in which generative AI can help. And obviously, on Cloud, this has been an important moment as pretty much every organization is thinking about how to use AI to drive transformation. And so across the board, from start-ups to large companies, they are engaging with us. And so I view it as a point of inflection there as well. Ruth? And then in terms of the second part of your question, AI has been so much a part of what we’ve been doing for quite some time that there are a number of different ways to answer it. One is, as I noted, we have a number of efficiency efforts underway, and one of them is about using AI and automation to further improve productivity across Alphabet. That being said, we already have AI in a lot of what we do, for example, in the way we operate and run the finance organization, it’s helpful in a lot of the analytics that we use. And one of the exciting things for us is the opportunity then to share that with Cloud customers. And Sundar just noted what we are doing within Google Workspace. We obviously all live on Google Workspace. And so that’s another example of how we benefit internally from the productivity from AI, but it’s also something that’s available for users and enterprise customers more broadly. And then finally, one of the areas that we’ve talked about is the opportunity with our compute capacity and all that we’ve done there and the infrastructure innovation, which, again, is helpful internally for what we do, but on behalf of our customers. Great. Thank you, both. Thank you. The next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Thanks for taking the questions. One for Sundar and then one for Ruth. Sundar, just as you think about integrating Bard into your search products over time, can you just talk more about what percentage of search queries you think would utilize large language model-type responses? And how should we think about the cost of running search on these models relative to today? And then, Ruth, I was just hoping you could follow-up on your comment on CapEx. Maybe if you could help us understand the modest step-up in CapEx relative to 3 months ago? Thank you. Thanks, Doug. Obviously, we have launched Bard as a complementary product to search. But we will be bringing LLM experiences more natively into search as well. I do think, first of all, on – we will be rolling it out in an incremental way so that we can test it, create and innovate. So I think we will approach it that way. I think overall, I think it can apply to a broad range of queries. So I think I’m excited that it can allow us to better help users in a category of queries, maybe in which there was no right answer, and they are more creative, etcetera. So I think those are opportunities. But even in our existing query categories, where we get a chance to do some heavy lifting for the users and we use AI to better give – guide them, I think you will see us exploring in those directions as well. It’s early days, but I think there is a lot of innovation to come.
On the cost side, we have always – costs of compute has always been a consideration for us. And if anything, I think it’s something we have developed extensive experience over many, many years. And so for us, it’s a nature of habit to constantly drive efficiencies in hardware, software and models across our fleet. And so this is not new. If anything, the sharper the technology curve is, we get excited by it because I think we have built world-class capabilities in taking that and then driving down cost sequentially and then deploying it at scale across the world. So I think we will take all that into account in terms of how we drive innovation here and – but I’m comfortable with how we will approach it. And in terms of CapEx, we do now expect that total CapEx for the year for 2023 will be modestly higher than in 2022. And I tried to point out that we’re expecting a step-up in the second quarter, and that will continue to increase throughout the year. And as we discussed last quarter, AI is a key component. It underlies everything that we do, and we’re continuing to invest in support of AI, support of our users, advertisers and our Cloud customers, since we are commenting on here. And then as we talked about last quarter, the increase in CapEx for the full year 2023 reflects the sizable increase in technical infrastructure investment, on the flip side, a decline in office facilities relative to last year. Thank you, Ruth. Thank you. The next question comes from Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Thank you so much for taking the questions, I hope everyone on the team as well. Maybe two, if I could. First, on cloud, obviously, one of the dominant themes and you touched upon it is this client optimization theme that’s going on broadly in cloud computing. Can you give us a little bit more of your perspective on where we are in terms of the optimization theme broadly in cloud computing as a headwind to either revenue growth or backlog growth compared to the tailwinds of broader long-term consumption growth and possibly the contribution of AI initiatives to cloud computing growth? And then second on YouTube. Obviously, you have seen a lot of success with respect to engagement and consumption on Shorts. Can you give us an update on where we are on monetization terms in Shorts compared to the consumption you have already seen in usage shifts? Thank you so much. So, in terms of the cloud question, the point we are trying to underscore is there is uncertainty in the economic environment. And so we saw some headwind from slower growth of consumption with customers really looking to optimize their costs given that macro climate. I will leave the forecasting to you on that. But as both Sundar and I commented on, really pleased with the momentum that the team has been delivering and the breadth of what they have been working on. I do think – I would add, that we are leaning into optimization. I mean there is an important moment to help our customers, and we take a long-term view. And so it’s definitely an area we are leaning in and trying to help customers make progress in their efficiencies where we can. Philipp? Yes. On the Shorts side, look, Shorts viewership is growing rapidly. We announced 50 billion plus daily views on the Q4 earnings call, up from 30 billion last spring. We are pleased with our continuing progress in monetization. As I have said earlier, people are engaging and converting on ads across Shorts at increasing rates, closing the gap between Shorts and long form is a top priority for us, as is continuing to build a greater, greater end user experience. Ads on Shorts are now available via video action app, Discovery and Performance Max campaigns and via product feeds. Shorts also are shoppable. Again, we are the only destination where creators can produce all forms of content across multiple formats and screens with multiple ways to make a living. And as Sundar said, last year, the number of channels that uploaded to Shorts daily grew over 80%. And then in February, we brought revenue sharing to Shorts via our YouTube Partner program. Our sustainable revenue sharing model at scale remains pretty unique in the industry, and we continue to see strong greater adoption. So ultimately, our goal is to make YouTube the best places for Shorts viewers and creators. And that’s really what we are focused on right now. Thank you. Thank you. The next question comes from Ross Sandler of Barclays. Please go ahead. Hey guys. I will just ask a tough question. Sundar, you came up in the group that structured a lot of the Android partnerships from inception and I believe possibly the iOS agreement as well. So, how do you feel about Alphabet’s ability to maintain the unit economics with these partnerships in light of Microsoft’s ambitions to increase its share of paid Search? And Ruth, does this have any impact on your outlook for profitability of overall Alphabet over the long-term? Thank you. Maybe I will – look, I think the – these dynamics are – have always been around. It’s important to remember, as far as I can remember, we have always been in a competitive environment for these deals. And while I can’t comment on the specifics of any of our partnership agreements, what has served us well is always, first of all, building the best product possible, focused on giving value to users. And when we work with our partners, we work hard to create a win-win – win-win experience, and ultimately, partners end up choosing us because that’s what their users want. And that’s always been what’s helped Search be widely distributed. So, I think it all starts with continuing to innovate and improve Search and making sure we are leading there. So, I think we have always approached it very robustly over the many, many years, and I am comfortable that we will continue to be able to do so. And then in terms of just longer term profitability, I think I will broaden out your question somewhat because the way we are looking at it is we continue to be committed to investing for growth, and we want to ensure we have overall capacity for growth. And so we have a number of work streams underway to, as we keep describing it, durably reengineer our cost base. And in particular, what we are excited about our long-term opportunities with AI and want to make sure we have the capacity to continue to invest there in the other areas where we see long-term growth in Search and ads, cloud, YouTube, hardware. And so that underscores our efforts to build in additional flexibility. And as we have said repeatedly, we want to ensure that expense growth is not growing out of revenue growth, and that means driving revenue growth and really being as disciplined as we can on these various work streams that we have discussed earlier in this call and last quarter as well to improve our expense growth trajectory. Thank you. The next question will come from Justin Post of BAML. Please go ahead. Great. Thanks a lot. Maybe one for Sundar and one for Ruth. So, you got the cost question on learning language models into Search. Can you talk about revenues? I think on one hand, you will see better relevancy and maybe better results with higher conversion. But on the other hand, there might be fewer areas for ads or fewer queries because people get answers quickly – more quickly. Are you optimistic on that transition, and maybe give us your thoughts there? And then, Ruth, backing out the one-time charges, it looks like OpEx growth is now 8%, so real progress there. Could you give us a flavor of where you are, you think in your optimization cycle? Thank you. So, first of all, throughout the years, as we have gone through many, many shifts in Search, and as we evolve Search, I think we have always had a strong grounded approach in terms of how we evolve ads as well. And we do that in a way that makes sense and provide value to users. It – the fundamental drivers here are people are looking for relevant information. And in commercial categories, they find ads to be highly relevant and valuable. And so that’s what drives this virtuous cycle. And I don’t think the underpinnings of the fact that users want relevant commercial information, they want choice in what they look at, even in areas where we are summarizing and answering, etcetera, users want choice. We care about sending traffic. Advertisers want to reach users. And so all those dynamics, I think which have long served us well remain. And as I said, we will be iterating and testing as we go. And I feel comfortable we will be able to drive innovation here like we have always done. And in terms of our OpEx trajectory, yes, there was the elevated expense in OpEx from the $2.6 billion in severance and office space charges. There was also a $988 million benefit from lower depreciation due to the change in useful lives. But that obviously is an ongoing benefit. And there was also, as we noted in our earnings release, a benefit from the shift in timing of stock-based compensation from the first quarter to the second quarter. So, a little bit of complexity there, but core of your question, we remain extremely focused on these various work streams that we have talked about. It starts with the pace of hiring. It goes to the various work streams that both Sundar and I referenced around using AI and automation to improve productivity, all that we are doing with suppliers and vendors to be as efficient as possible, all that we are doing around optimizing how and where we work. You have seen some of those announcements this quarter beyond the workforce reduction, things that we are doing in, for example, office services, and we are executing against each of these various work streams. So, our view is that there is more to do. And as we try to be clear, we are in execution mode. You will see some of the benefit in ‘23. You will see more of it in ‘24, and we are going to continue building against it beyond. Great. Thank you. Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. I have one for Philipp and one for Ruth. Philipp, we are trying to get under the hood on Search advertising and trying to understand changes in demand between sellers of goods and sellers of services. Can you give us any help looking at the service side? Has demand returned back to pre-pandemic levels? And then in terms of goods and e-commerce, have you seen a slowing of demand? Anything you can help us kind of put this – level set it back to maybe pre-pandemic levels to understand services versus goods demand? And then for Ruth, on the terms of efficiency and being more diligent, how does the significantly higher cost of capital impact the way you are managing and evaluating the Other Bets assets? Anything there on how you may be rethinking some of the Other Bets and what are you doing in changing some of the structures about the Other Bets assets? Thanks. It was a bit hard to hear you. You were breaking up. So, I think I am going to start and address what I heard as the second question, as we are looking at higher cost of capital in this environment, what – how does that affect the way we are looking at Other Bets. Hopefully, we heard you correctly, it was crackling. Look, I think as we have talked about repeatedly, as it relates to Other Bets, our focus is to use deep technology to drive innovation, and we are very focused on the pace of investment and financial returns. That has been a consistent focus to generate attractive returns. And I think the core operating models and the long-term operating models are going to be the most relevant as we are looking at the returns we can generate. Yes, absolutely mindful of higher cost of capital. But I think its core, we are looking at what’s the value creation and the return on those. And as we indicated when we went through the reduction in force, we similarly worked across the Other Bets and some of them as they are on a path to ongoing growth, we were moderating what is the expense trajectory there as we are looking at what’s the overall return on invested capital. And we are continuing to work on these to make sure that we are delivering value it. Your point is an important one that’s part of a broader question about the underlying operating assumptions. Okay. Philipp, I don’t know if you heard the first one? Yes. On the first part, again, it didn’t come across quite clearly, but I hope I understood correctly. In Search, revenues grew modestly year-over-year, again, reflecting an increase in the retail and travel verticals, offset partially by decline in finance and media and entertainment. So, excluding the impact of FX performance, it was actually similar to last quarter. The ongoing performance of Search, notwithstanding the headwinds, reflects really Search’s resilience with the, I would say, ability of Search to surface demand and deliver a measurable ROI in an uncertain environment. I called out the key verticals in the quarter. There is really no additional color on other verticals. I would say maybe more broadly, what we saw reflects what’s being reported elsewhere, and across the headlines, many companies are very focused on shorter term profitability amidst this uncertainty and some pullback at budgets as well. Okay. Thanks. That’s clear. Thank you. The next question comes from Mark Mahaney of Evercore. Please go ahead. Okay. Can I try two questions, please? I think Philipp, you talked about kind of a more of a pullback in network ad revenue versus Search and YouTube. Do you have any thoughts on why that was the case? And then Ruth, the cloud business, even with the accounting changes on this very steady march towards profitability, you turned the corner now. You talked about growing the business for long-term profitability. But are there any reasons why we wouldn’t – why they shouldn’t be sustainably profitable kind of starting from here as the business continues to scale, or could it be that, that profitability could be wobbly for a while before it’s sustainably profitable that segment cloud? Thank you. Yes. Why don’t I just add, I will take both of those. So, in network, really, it’s a continuation of what we talked about last quarter. We saw the ongoing pullback in advertiser spend. And I would contrast that last quarter, we talked about both a pullback in YouTube and network, and we were pleased that we saw the stabilization in ad spend on a sequential basis in YouTube. We still saw ongoing pullback in network, which tends to be a mix of businesses, as you know well. And then in terms of cloud, I tried to make that clear in my opening comments as well. I think it’s a really important question. We are very pleased with the Q1 results. And as both Sundar and I noted, we are intensely focused on all elements of the cost space and the long-term path to attractive profitability. At the same time, I think at the core of your question, and what we were trying to convey is we will continue to invest to support long-term growth, in particular, given the opportunities we see delivering AI capabilities to our customers. So, as I have said in the past, you shouldn’t extrapolate from quarter-to-quarter, but we are very pleased to be at this level and are continuing to focus on profitability and long-term value creation here. Okay. Thank you, Ruth. Thank you. And our last question will come from Colin Sebastian from Baird. Please go ahead. Great. Thank you. Two for me as well. I guess first, Sundar, the consolidation of the AI teams, I think you talked about that helping to accelerate innovation. So, I am curious, specifically with that consolidation, what are the product milestones that we should look out for related to that? And then Philipp, regarding your comments on retail, specifically on shopping and payments, how should we think about that evolving across the platform this year? Maybe similarly, what are some milestones we should look out for on that front? Thank you. Thanks. I am quite excited by bringing the two world-class teams, I think – of both Brain and DeepMind. Their collective accomplishments in AI over the last decade have really set the stage for this moment. And so both getting access to pool talent so that they can work together in a coordinated way and definitely will help us pool our computational resources too, which is going to be critical and will help us build. The core product is obviously building more capable models safely and responsibly and doing it taking into account all the capabilities our customers need, both on the consumer side and the cloud side and being able to iterate and getting that virtuous cycle going. So, you already have seen us put out PaLM APIs, and we are incorporating PaLM across our products, but we will continue that progress, and we will keep you posted as we do. So, retail is an important vertical and driver for us, and I called out the year-over-year increase in retail and Search and other. I also talked earlier about the macro climate and how we have established. We can really drive value for retailers, even in challenging times, whether it’s online, offline, both. And we are helping them drive their business goals, meet customers wherever they choose to shop, and maybe a little more some key trends here. Retailers are increasingly focused on maintaining margins and driving ROI right now. PMax, broad manage were key levers providing more incremental conversions, while insights on bids and budgets are really helping retailers identify opportunities for growth and efficiencies across our suite of products. I have talked at length on prior calls about omnichannel. Our local and omnichannel solutions are helping bridge the gap here between online and offline by using AI to reach nearby shoppers, promote local inventory, fulfillment options, optimize in-store visits and sales, for example. And then to help really retain loyal customers and acquiring new ones, we have YouTube app deep linking and new customer acquisition goals in PMax are helping here, making checkouts easy with tools like virtual cards on Chrome is obviously important. So, those are just some of the key points. Overall, we are giving retailers really the best, I hope AI-powered tools and solutions to maximize reach and ROI and really create a seamless experience, including, where possible, on the payment side for their customers, and this will continue to be our focus here. Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any further remarks. Thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter 2023 call. Thank you and have a good evening. Thank you everyone. This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating.

Thank you for standing by for the Alphabet Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Alphabet's second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler and Ruth Porat. Now, I’ll quickly cover the Safe Harbor.
Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations and financial performance maybe considered forward-looking and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC.
During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. Our comments will be on year-over-year comparisons unless we state otherwise.
And now, I’ll turn the call over to Sundar. Thank you, Jim, and hello, everyone. We are holding our call from London today. It's an important hub for us, and I'm excited to spend time with our local teams, including Google DeepMind as well as leaders and partners from across the region.
This quarter, we shared great progress at I/O, Brandcast and Google Marketing Live, and we are looking forward to Cloud Next in August. The momentum across the Company drove our results this quarter. We delivered solid performance in Search and YouTube and ongoing strong growth in Cloud, where we remain focused on long-term value creation. And we continue our important work to operate more efficiently, creating durable savings to fund investments in our biggest priorities. Today, I'll talk about this momentum, including our continued leadership in AI and our excitement about the evolution of Search.
At I/O, we shared how we are making AI helpful for everyone in four important ways: first, improving knowledge and learning. This is our seventh year as an AI-first company, and we intuitively know how to incorporate AI into our products. Large language models make them even more helpful, models like PaLM 2 and soon Gemini, which we are building to be multimodal. These advances provide an opportunity to reimagine many of our products, including our most important product, Search. We are in a period of incredible innovation for Search, which has continuously evolved over the years.
This quarter saw our next major evolution with the launch of the Search Generative Experience, or SGE, which uses the power of generative AI to make search even more natural and intuitive. User feedback has been very positive so far. It can better answer the queries people come to us with today, while also unlocking entirely new types of questions that Search can answer.
For example, we found that generative AI can connect the dots for people as they explore a topic or project, helping them weigh multiple factors and personal preferences before making a purchase or booking a trip. We see this new experience as another jumping off point for exploring the web, enabling users to go deeper to learn about a topic.
I'm proud of the engineering excellence underlying our progress. Since the May launch, we've boosted serving efficiency, reducing the time it takes to generate AI snapshots by half. We'll deliver even faster responses over time. We are engaging with the broader ecosystem and will continue to prioritize approaches that send valuable traffic and support a healthy open web.
Ads will continue to play an important role in this new search experience. Many of these new queries are inherently commercial in nature. We have more than 20 years of experience serving ads relevant to users' commercial queries, and SGE enhances our ability to do this even better. We are testing and evolving placements and formats and giving advertisers tools to take advantage of generative AI. Philipp will talk more about how we are using generative AI in our ads products to better serve both advertisers and users.
Second, we are helping people use AI to boost their creativity and productivity. One example is Bard, our experiment in conversational AI. Since launching in March, it continues to get better. We rolled out a number of exciting features and capabilities earlier this month. Bard is now available in most of the world and over 40 of the most widely spoken languages.
We also added Google Lens capabilities so you can take an image and ask all kinds of questions, turn it into code and more. This new feature has been really popular, and it's been great to see people sharing their experiences. Bard can now read its responses aloud, and you can adjust them for tone and style. We continue to see great interest in using Bard for coding tasks.
On productivity, earlier this year, we introduced Duet AI in both Google Cloud and Workspace. It helps people collaborate with AI to code, write and get better insights from data and more. Today, more than 750,000 Workspace users have access to the new features in preview.
Third, we are making it easier for others to innovate using AI. One way is by providing Google Cloud's high-performance infrastructure, optimized for a range of generative AI models. It's being used by thousands of customers and partners to transform their businesses. I'll give an update on the cloud business in just a moment.
Finally, we are making sure we develop and deploy AI technology responsibly so that everyone can benefit. Last week, we signed on to joint commitments with other leading AI companies at the White House, building on the principles that have guided our work for many years. To take advantage of the AI opportunities ahead, we have been sharpening our focus as a company, investing responsibly with great discipline and finding areas where we can operate more cost effectively. We have made good progress in data center machine efficiency, which will pay dividends as we continue to invest in AI.
We continue to slow our expense growth and pace of hiring and ensure our teams are aligned to our highest priorities. This quarter, we reallocated a number of teams, including aligning Waze's ad sales with our existing business organization. We are combining various engineering efforts across core infrastructure and cloud. Products like Bard and SGE are being built by small fast-moving teams that have been reallocated to these high-priority efforts. Overall, we are actively moving people to higher priority activities within the Company, and we continue to optimize our real estate footprint for current and future needs.
Next, Google Cloud. We see continued growth with Q2 revenue of $8 billion, up 28%, and operating profit of $395 million. Our AI-optimized infrastructure is a leading platform for training and serving generative AI models. More than 70% of gen AI unicorns are Google Cloud customers, including Cohere, Jasper, Typeface and many more. We provide the widest choice of AI supercomputer options with Google TPUs and advanced NVIDIA GPUs, and recently launched new A3 AI supercomputers powered by NVIDIA's H100. This enables customers like AppLovin to achieve nearly 2 times better price performance than industry alternatives.
Our new generative AI offerings are expanding our total addressable market and winning new customers. We are seeing strong demand for the more than 80 models, including third-party and popular open source in our Vertex, Search and Conversational AI platforms with a number of customers growing more than 15x from April to June. Among them, Priceline is improving trip planning capabilities. Carrefour is creating full marketing campaigns in a matter of minutes. And Capgemini is building hundreds of use cases to streamline time-consuming business processes. Our new anti-money laundering AI helps banks like HSBC identify financial crime risk. And our new AI-powered target and lead identification suite is being applied at Cerevel to help enable drug discovery.
Our generative AI capabilities also give us an opportunity to win new customers and upsell into our installed base of 9 million paying Google Workspace customers. I mentioned Duet AI earlier. Instacart is using it to improve customer service workflows. And companies like Xtend are scaling sales outreach and optimizing customer service. Customers confidently choose Workspace because of the safety and security we provide their distributed workforces.
Our AI capabilities are helping us differentiate core products like cybersecurity. We have integrated AI throughout our portfolio, winning organizations like Pfizer who are using Google Cloud to transform their security operations. Chronicle Security operations suite with Mandiant fully integrated is helping customers stay protected at every stage of the security life cycle. In the first half of 2023, we saw a 35% increase in incident response engagements compared to the same period last year.
Finally, our AI capabilities are also expanding our partner ecosystem with hundreds of ISVs and SaaS providers, such as Box, Salesforce and Snorkel and the world's largest consulting firms like Accenture and Deloitte. They've collectively committed to train more than 150,000 people on Google Cloud generative AI.
Turning next to YouTube. Earlier this year, we shared that revenues across YouTube products were nearly $40 billion for the 12 months ending in March. I'm really pleased with how YouTube is growing audiences and driving increased engagement. YouTube Shorts are now watched by over 2 billion logged-in users every month, up from 1.5 billion just one year ago. The living room remained our fastest-growing screen in 2022 in terms of watch time. We are reaching more than 150 million people on connected TV screens in the U.S. and seeing growth in momentum internationally.
And on Subscriptions, there is good growth. Late last year, we announced over 80 million YouTube Music and Premium subscribers. Sign-ups for NFL Sunday Ticket kicked off in April, and we look forward to hosting our first football season on YouTube this fall.
Finally, hardware and Android. Pixel continues to have strong sales momentum. We introduced new Pixel devices at I/O, including Pixel Fold, Pixel Tablet and Pixel 7A, and we've had a great response. Android 14, our latest OS, will incorporate our advances in generative AI to personalize Android phones. The Pixel and Android teams are working together to advance the latest devices. The Pixel Fold is a great example with its many hardware and software innovations.
Before I close, you may have seen that we just announced some exciting news that Ruth is taking on the important new role of President and Chief Investment Officer. As our longest-serving CFO, she has helped guide the company through an amazing period of growth, a global pandemic and the ongoing economic uncertainty that has followed. I'm excited to continue to work with Ruth, who will lead our 2024 planning and remain as CFO while we do a full search for a successor. So, it's business as usual now and no change in approach for the future. I look forward to seeing the impact Ruth will have in our new role, driving our investments, engaging with our stakeholders and creating opportunities for people and communities everywhere.
To close, I'm energized by the pace of innovation and the momentum across the Company. With 15 products that each serve 0.5 billion people and 6 that serve over 2 billion each, we have so many opportunities to deliver on our mission. Thank you to our employees around the world for their great work this quarter. Over to you, Philipp. Thanks, Sundar, and hello, everyone. Happy to be here with you all today. Let's jump right into our performance for the quarter.
Google Services revenues of $66 billion were up 5% year-on-year. In Google Advertising, Search and Other revenues grew 5% year-on-year, led by solid growth in the retail vertical. In YouTube ads, revenues were up 4% year-on-year, driven by growth in brand, followed by direct response, reflecting further stabilization in advertiser spend. In Network, revenues declined 5% year-on-year. Google Other revenues were up 24% year-on-year, led by strong growth in YouTube subscriptions revenues.
Let's now take a few minutes to cover our 3 key priority areas: Google AI, Retail and YouTube, which I've laid out in prior quarters as clear opportunities for long-term advertising growth. I'll then turn it over to Ruth for more details on our financial performance.
Q2 was a big quarter for Google AI and our ads products. I/O, GML and Brandcast were a testament to our deep commitment to building cutting-edge tools and solutions that help businesses navigate complexity in real time and deliver the results they need, all while improving the experience for users. Sunder covered some of these innovations. I'll share more.
It's worth reiterating that while generative AI is now supercharging new and existing ads products with tons of potential ahead, AI has been at the core of our ads business for years. In fact, today, nearly 80% of advertisers already use at least one AI-powered search ads product.
Our approach to AI and ads remains grounded in understanding what drives real value for businesses right now and what's most helpful for users. Advertisers tell us they're looking for more assistive experience to get set up with us faster. So at GML, we launched a new conversational experience in Google Ads powered by a LLM tuned specifically from ads data to make campaign construction easier than ever. Advertisers also tell us they want help creating high-quality ads that work in an instant. So, we're rolling out a revamped asset creation flow in Performance Max that helps customers adapt and scale their most successful creative concepts in a few clicks.
And there's even more with PMax. We launched a new asset insights and new search term insights that improve campaign performance understanding and new customer life cycle goals that led advertisers optimize for new and existing customers while maximizing sales.
We've long said it's all about reaching the right customer with the right creative at the right time. So later this year, automatically created assets, which are already generating headlines and descriptions for search ads, will start using generative AI to create assets that are even more relevant to customer queries.
Broad match also got updates. AI-based keyword prioritization ensures the right keyword, bid, budget, creative and landing page is chosen when there are multiple overlapping keywords eligible. And then to make it easier for advertisers to optimize visual storytelling and drive consideration in the mid funnel, we're launching two new AI part ad solutions, Demand Gen and Video View campaigns, and both will include Shorts inventory.
Sundar talked earlier about SGE and our early experiments with new ad formats. We're in active conversations with advertisers, publishers and partners to get their input on how to make these solutions work best for them and are excited to test and evolve this experience as we learn more.
Let's pivot to Retail, where we had a good quarter. Profitability remains a top theme for retailers, so solutions like PMax that drive bottom line value continue to do well. We also continue to see success in helping businesses unlock efficient growth and deliver on their omnichannel goals.
Take Ace Hardware, who tapped into AI-powered search and omnibidding to capture increased seasonal demand leading up to Memorial Day. This drove increases across online sales, store visits and in-store sales, resulting in 87% year-over-year growth in omni revenue from Google Ads and led to one of the largest revenue weeks ever for Ace store owners.
Q2 also brought innovation on the consumer and merchant front. We've rolled out a new gen AI-powered virtual try-on tool that brings the fitting room experience online. Shoppers can try on women's tops across a wide array of models from brands like Anthropologie, Everlane, H&M and Loft. Rich, visual engaging content is a win-win for both consumers and merchants. In fact, product offers with more than one image see a 76% average increase in impressions and a 32% increase in clicks.
Our new product studio uses gen AI to help retailers create tailored eye-catching imagery for free, and we are working towards optimizing for performance. We think this will be a game changer, especially for SMBs who can now create high-quality images to use both across Google and their own sites without spending a lot of time or money.
As we continue to make Google a valuable place for merchants to grow their businesses and connect with users, Merchant Center Next is another win. We've seen 2x growth in the number of businesses using Merchant Center in the past two years. And we're now simplifying it by automating inventory management and giving a consolidated view of performance insights. Better tools means better growth for merchants and better experiences for users.
Moving to YouTube. I've said it before, I'll say it again: YouTube starts with our Creators, and it's their success and our multi-format strategy that will drive YouTube's long-term growth. In prior quarters, I've laid out how we think about this. Enabling our Creators to make a living on our platform with more formats and awesome tools leads to more content, which leads to quality consumption of video content, another big focus of the team. And this leads to better opportunities for monetization and for advertisers to support this incredible ecosystem.
As we think about growth, we're focused on Shorts, Connected TV and our subscription offerings, all of which grew nicely this quarter. Let me double-click into Shorts and CTV.
First, Shorts. Momentum remains strong. Watch time and monetization are moving in the right direction. Last year, we introduced ads on Shorts to help drive performance in direct response campaigns. We have video action, Performance Max and ad campaigns. As of Q2, brand advertisers can start testing Shorts ads and awareness campaigns. It's still early days, but we're excited by the results.
LANEIGE, Amorepacific's number one premium skin care brand, was an early adopter. It leaned into video reach campaigns and new creative over a 10-day test to drive a 21% increase in unique users reached from Shorts and in Feed, all in a more efficient CPM.
Second, Connected TV. Substantial engagement by viewers and ROI for advertisers is driving monetization of the living room. We are very pleased with the growth we've seen and how we're delivering the reach, results and relevance that businesses are looking for at scale.
At Brandcast, we announced two new ad offerings for streaming. First, 30-second unskippable ads are coming to YouTube Select, which is landing 70% plus of impressions on the TV screen. 30-second ads are a TV industry staple, and now YouTube is bringing our advanced audience capabilities and unparalleled reach to the format. We're also exploring new pause experiences so brands can drive awareness or action when you hit pause.
Looking at YouTube holistically, according to our measurement partners, Nielsen, TransUnion and Ipsos MMA, YouTube delivers higher ROI than TV and other online video on average. Take The Hershey Company. As part of a multiyear partnership to optimize its YouTube strategy, Hershey's brands have been tapping into CTV, efficient AI-powered formats and Made for Platform creative, leading to YouTube becoming its number one ROI driving media partner, producing a 65% plus increase in ROI from 2018 to 2023.
One last highlight that bridges the power of YouTube with our continued efforts to bring the best across Google to our partners. With Warner Bros. Discovery, we expanded our multiyear relationship across our entire Android ecosystem, including partnering on the launch of Max, a deepened mutually beneficial relationship on Google TV, and plans to work together on new surfaces. YouTube's expanded deal for Max, inclusive of a Max NFL Sunday Ticket bundle on YouTube TV, also underscores our joint commitment to bring the highest quality content and experiences to our customers.
I'll close by echoing Sundar with a huge thank you to Googlers everywhere for their incredible passion and hard work and to our customers and partners for their continued collaboration and trust. Ruth, over to you. Thank you, Philipp. Before I go into the results, first, Sundar, thank you very much for the opportunity. I'm very excited about the new role, and I look forward to it.
So, turning to the results. We're very pleased with our financial results for the second quarter, which reflect an acceleration of growth in Search and momentum in Cloud. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook.
For the second quarter, our consolidated revenues were $74.6 billion, up 7% or up 9% in constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth. Total cost of revenues was $31.9 billion, up 6%, driven by other cost of revenues of $19.4 billion, which was up 8%. Growth here was driven by content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube subscription offerings, followed by hardware costs associated with Pixel family launches in the second quarter. As noted in our earnings release, the overall increase in data center and other operations costs was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in estimated useful lives we discussed last quarter.
Operating expenses were $20.9 billion, up 4%. Operating income was $21.8 billion, up 12%, and our operating margin was 29%. I will cover our expense and margin performance in our outlook. Other income and expense was $65 million. Net income was $18.4 billion. We delivered free cash flow of $21.8 billion in the second quarter and $71 billion for the trailing 12 months, reflecting improved operating performance as well as the deferral of certain tax payments to the fourth quarter of 2023 as noted in our earnings release. We ended the quarter with $118 billion in cash and marketable securities.
Turning to our segment results. Prior period results have been recast for two changes that we made as of the first quarter. First, DeepMind is now reported as part of Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs. Second, we updated our cost allocation methodologies. In the second quarter, we then combined the Brain team from Google Research with DeepMind to form Google DeepMind. Costs associated with the Brain team, which were previously included in Google Services, are now reported as part of Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs. We have not recast prior period results to reflect this additional change.
Within Google Services, revenues were $66.3 billion, up 5%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $42.6 billion in the quarter were up 5%, led by growth in retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $7.7 billion were up 4%, driven by brand advertising, followed by direct response, reflecting further stabilization in spending by advertisers. Network advertising revenues of $7.9 billion were down 5%. Other revenues were $8.1 billion, up 24%, reflecting growth in YouTube non-advertising revenues, primarily from subscription growth in YouTube Music Premium and YouTube TV, followed by growth in hardware revenues, primarily driven by the launch of the Pixel 7a in the second quarter. Finally, Play returned to positive growth in the second quarter. TAC was $12.5 billion, up 3%. Google Services operating income was $23.5 billion, up 8%, and the operating margin was 35%.
Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $8 billion for the quarter, up 28%. GCP revenue growth remained strong across geographies, industries and products. That being said, we saw a continued moderation in the rate of consumption growth as consumers optimize their spend. Google Workspace strong revenue growth was driven by increases in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had operating income of $395 million and the operating margin was 5%.
As to our Other Bets, for the second quarter, revenues were $285 million, and the operating loss was $813 million. The decrease in operating loss was primarily driven by a reduction in valuation-based compensation liabilities related to certain Other Bets.
Turning to our outlook for the business. With respect to Google Services, first, within advertising. We were pleased with the acceleration of Search advertising revenue growth in the second quarter. Our continued ability to generate sustained growth reflects our unparalleled engineering innovation that creates extraordinary experiences for users and capabilities for advertisers and delivered with the deep expertise of our go-to-market team. And in YouTube, we saw ongoing signs of stabilization in advertiser spending. We are prioritizing product focus on increasing quality consumption of video content with both Shorts and in the living room, which is translating into improved monetization.
Second, within other revenues. In our YouTube subscription products, the sustained, strong growth in revenues reflects significant subscriber growth. You may have seen that last week, we increased subscription prices for YouTube Music and Premium, which underscores the value of the products. Strong year-on-year growth in hardware revenues was due, in large part, to a timing change given the Pixel 7a was launched in the second quarter, whereas the Pixel 6a launch occurred in the third quarter last year. Looking ahead, the launch timing change will be a headwind to hardware revenue growth in the third quarter. Play returned to positive growth in the second quarter, driven primarily by a solid increase in the number of buyers.
Turning to Google Cloud. We are particularly excited about the customer interest in our AI-optimized infrastructure, our large language models, our AI platform services and our new generative AI offerings such as Duet AI for Google Workspace, although we are still clearly in the early days. At the same time, we continue to experience headwinds in the second quarter for moderation in consumption growth as customers optimize their spend. We continue to invest aggressively while remaining focused on profitable growth.
In terms of expenses and profitability, we remain very focused on durably reengineering our cost base. Most evident to date are the actions we have taken to reduce the pace of headcount growth, including the workforce reductions we announced in the first quarter and a slower pace of organic hiring, in part given our focus on reallocating talent from within to fuel our growth priorities.
A quick comment on the sequential improvement in operating margins in the second quarter. There are two factors to note. First, the benefit from an acceleration in search advertising revenue growth in the second quarter. Second, the vast majority of the charges related to our workforce reduction and optimization of our global office space were taken in Q1.
Finally, as it relates to CapEx, in Q2, the largest component was for servers, which included a meaningful increase in our investments in AI compute. The sequential step up in the second quarter was lower than anticipated for two reasons. First, with respect to office facilities, we continue to moderate the pace of fit-outs and ground-up construction to reflect the slower expected pace of headcount growth. Second, there were delays in certain data center construction projects. We expect elevated levels of investment in our technical infrastructure increasing through the back half of 2023 and continuing to grow in 2024. The primary driver is to support the opportunities we see in AI across Alphabet, including investments in GPUs and proprietary TPUs as well as data center capacity. With all that said, we remain committed to durably reengineering our cost base in order to help create capacity for these investments in support of long-term, sustainable financial value.
Thank you. Sundar, Philipp and I will now take your questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. I have two. The first one for Sundar. Sundar, I'd be curious to learn about some of your early learnings and surprises around consumer behavior on how people are using Bard versus Search. And what new behaviors or consumer utility are you most excited about as you think about what Gemini could provide for people over the course of the next year or so?
And then the second one for Ruth. Ruth, congrats on the new position. One question just about the durable expense comment. I think last quarter, you talked about the idea that expenses could grow slower than revenue in 2024. Is that still the right way to think about it? And just to confirm, does that include the impact of depreciation in those comments? Thanks. Thanks, Brian. I'll take the first part. It's definitely early days, but both across Bard and Search Generative Experience, feedback has been very positive from our users. I think we are definitely now able to serve, I would say, deeper and broader information use cases, which is very exciting. I wouldn't say surprised. So for example, people are really using it to -- for coding, something we understood, but it's definitely on the new side. There's a lot of excitement around -- we integrated Google Lens into Bard. We have known how big Google Lens can be. We see that in the visual searches we get and how much it has grown over the last two years, and so we've been doing this for a while. But definitely, that, in Bard, has been super well received. So which gives me a sense that as -- given Gemini is being built from the ground up to be multimodal, I think that's an area that's going to excite users. When I go back many years ago when we did universal search, whenever, for users, we can abstract different content types and put them in a seamless way, they tend to receive it well. And so I'm definitely excited about what's ahead. And on your second question, Brian. We are really pleased with the operating performance in the second quarter. We've been saying for some time that we are focused on revenue growth ahead of expense growth and achieved that for the first in some time, and that is cost of sales plus operating expense overall. And we do remain very focused on durably reengineering our cost base. There are a lot of stream -- work streams that are in flight, and I mentioned a couple of them in opening comments. This remains a major priority as Sundar and I both commented on. The next question comes from Eric Sheridan of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Maybe one for Sundar and one also for Ruth. Sundar, can you talk a little bit about elements of open source versus closed and things like custom silicon and how you're thinking about AI offerings broadly developing over the next couple of years and what you see as some of the key differentiation points that Google, either through the cloud business or the consumer offerings, are going to bring to market, and how we should think about differentiation playing out to a greater degree in AI in the years ahead? That would be number one.
And then, Ruth, I'll echo Brian's congrats as well on the new role. Maybe both of you could talk to why this type of role might be important at this point in time for Alphabet? And Ruth, what you're looking to sort of drive into the organization from this new role as you move into it in the fall. Thanks. Thanks Eric. On the first part, obviously, a big topic. I would broadly say, the investments for AI, when you look at the type of deep computer science work, the talent we have worked hard to bring to the Company, and from the ground up, the infrastructure we have built from the earliest days, Google has been a company. We've thought about the switches in our data centers, wherever we think we can do the best and get an advantage by innovating, we have chosen to do so. We have done that on AI, on the silicon side. But what's important to us is really stay focused on our users and customers and support all the innovations that's needed. So for example, with cloud, we've been -- we've really embraced open architecture. We have embraced customers wanting to be multi-cloud when it makes sense for them. So similarly, you would see with AI, we will embrace -- we will offer not just our first-party models, we'll offer third-party models, including open source models. I think open source has a critical role to play in this ecosystem.
Google contributes -- we are one of the largest contributors to -- if you look at Hugging Face and in terms of the contribution there, when you look at projects like Android, Chromium and so on, Kubernetes and so on. So, we'll embrace that and we'll stay at the cutting edge of technology, and I think that will serve us well for the long term.
On the second part of your question, first of all, I'm very grateful and thankful to all the work that Ruth has done for the Company. It's too invaluable to capture in words. I am super thrilled that she's going to continue on an impactful new role. And the scale of our company, with the broad changes in technology, I think it's more important than ever before to engage on these issues globally at scale and advocate on the economic opportunity of the investments we make across Alphabet and Google. And I'm glad that she's going to continue as CFO. And so no changes there, and we'll take the time to find a successor, and Ruth will be closely involved, not just on that, but also our long-range planning, including 2024. Ruth, anything to add? Just to underscore, when you ask the point about impact, one of the places Sundar and I have discussed quite a bit is landing well the 2024 capital plan and the multiyear plan and completing all of the very important efforts we have underway. We're excited about what they mean, setting the company up well to be able to invest for long-term growth. And so we're continuing to execute against those. And then I think Sundar summarized it well. We see technology can make such a difference in the lives of so many and there's lots of those economies. And to be able to focus on the impact on economic growth and the opportunity for people, for organizations, for countries, I think, is a privilege. I'm really excited about it, in particular, with this amazing company. And so focusing there as well as the investments that we make across Alphabet to drive economic growth globally across numerous sectors. The next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. One for Sundar and one for Ruth. For Sundar, curious, how do you think about timing for more broadly integrating generative AI into Search? And more specifically, what are some of the things you'll need to see to do that?
And then, Ruth, just on CapEx, the 2Q CapEx is lower than expected, as you explained. Do you still expect modestly higher CapEx in '23 versus '22? And then, I know it's getting a little bit ahead, but how should we think about kind of timing of that real estate and office optimization efforts through '23 and then also into '24? Thanks. Look, on the Search Generative Experience, we definitely wanted to make sure we're thinking deeply from first principles. While it's exciting new technology, we've constantly been bringing in AI innovations into Search for the past few years, and this is the next step in that journey. But it is a big change, so we thought about from first principles. It really gives us a chance to now not always be constrained in the way Search was working before, allowed us to think outside the box. And I see that play out in the Experience. So I would say we are ahead of where I thought we'd be at this point in time. The feedback has been very positive. We've just improved our efficiency pretty dramatically since the product launch. The latency has improved significantly. We are keeping a very high bar, and -- but I would say we are ahead on all the metrics in terms of how we look at it internally and so couldn't be more pleased with it. And so you will see us continue to bring it to more and more users. And over time, this will just be how Search works. And so while it's -- we are taking deliberate steps, we are building the next major evolution in Search, and I'm pleased with how it's going so far. In terms of CapEx, I tried to lay out sort of the cadence of CapEx, and the point was an important one that the sequential step up in the second quarter was lower than anticipated for the two reasons I noted: one, the work that we're doing around office facilities; and then the delays in certain data center construction projects. That's why we wanted to be really clear that we do expect elevated levels of investment in our technical infrastructure, and that would be increasing through the back half of 2023, consistent with the comments we've made previously that we expected 2023 to be higher given the slower start at the front half of the year and then continuing to grow into 2024.
And the primary driver of this, as you know well, is to support the opportunities we see in AI across the Company, including the investments that we've already talked about, proprietary TPUs, all that we're doing with GPUs as well as data center capacity. And as we continue to see the pace of innovation accelerate, we just want to make sure we're positioned to address the opportunity across Alphabet.
And to your -- the other part of your question, when we look at real estate optimization, that's one of many work streams that are important when we talk about durably reengineering our cost base to create capacity for investments and support long-term sustainable financial value, and we're continuing to work against that. The next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley of UBS. Please go ahead. I wanted to just follow up on the -- some of the SGE questions and just get a sense -- I know it's early, but what are you seeing in terms of monetization? And how do you guys think about that as you scale up the deployment of SGE? Is that -- I think there's a lot of concern out there that maybe in the short term, it's a bit of a headwind. But over the longer term, maybe query growth from a more useful product can kind of kind of make up for that. But how do you guys see that playing out? And what can you share there? Maybe I can give some color here. We have obviously been focused on bringing this experience and making sure it works well for users. And it's very clear to me, first of all, as a user myself, there are certain queries for which the answers are so significantly better. It's a clear quality win. And so I think we are definitely headed in the right direction, and we can see it in our metrics and the feedback we are getting from our users as well.
And the thing that doesn't change with these experiences is that many -- a lot of user journeys are commercial in nature. There are inherent commercial user needs. And what's exciting to me is that SGE gives us an opportunity to serve those needs again, better, right, and better. So it's clearly an exciting area. And as part of that, the fundamentals don't change. Users have commercial needs, and they are looking for choices, and there are merchants and advertisers looking to provide those choices.
So, those fundamentals are true in SGE as well. And we have a number of experiments in flight, including ads, and we are pleased with the early results we are seeing. And so we will continue to evolve the experience, but I'm comfortable at what we are seeing, and we have a lot of experience working through these transitions, and we'll bring all those learnings here as well. The next question comes from Justin Post of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Great. Thank you. Just ask about the Cloud. It really looks like revenue growth stabilized despite optimization. So could you talk about the pipeline and the client wins in the quarter, how you felt about those? And then any uptick are you seeing related to AI spending in the total revenues this quarter or in the second half? Thank you. Thanks, Justin. Okay. It is an exciting moment overall in Cloud because there is definitely a lot of interest from customers on AI, and they definitely are engaging in many more conversations with us. So I would say, without commenting on the short term, but when I think about it long term, I view the AI opportunity as expanding our total addressable market and allows us to win new customers. Scale of investments that we can directly bring to cloud now. As I said earlier, we have over 80 models across Vertex, Enterprise Search and Conversational AI, and we are taking all of them, translating it into deep industry solutions. So, I'm excited about it.
Second, it gives us an opportunity to upsell and cross-sell into our installed base. So for example, if you think about Duet AI in Google Workspace now, it's a collection of all our generative AI-powered collaboration features. We can bring it and make it available to more than 9 million paying Google Workspace customers. Similarly, with Duet AI in Google Cloud, again, allows us to go back to our installed base and engage in deeper conversations.
And finally, I think AI helps us differentiate our core products. For example, if you take a look at cybersecurity, we are deeply incorporating AI to drive profound changes there. So overall, I'm excited, and I view this as a long-term opportunity. And all the investments we are doing in AI across Alphabet, including the work we are doing in Google DeepMind and Google Research on Gemini and so on are directly applicable to Cloud as well. So excited about it. Great. Thank you. Maybe one follow-up for Ruth. Did the infrastructure cloud grow faster than Workspaces again this quarter? So, we -- I don't think we commented on that. And yes, in the second quarter, GCP growth was above the growth rate for cloud overall. The next question comes from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. One for Philipp and one for Sundar. Philipp, can you talk about the ad market? If you step back, you're seeing real signs now of weakness in linear TV, ad agencies, small and digital companies were all slowing, and the macro backdrop is I think cloudy, yet you guys have accelerated your growth this quarter. What factors are you looking at? Do you see that would identify why are you growing while others are really struggling and slowing down?
And then, Sundar, I think you spent over $100 billion on R&D over the past five years, and yet there's a narrative that it's so competitive and so expensive to compete going forward. Can you talk a bit about how you're visiting that R&D spend? Any near-term cadence updates you can give us for growth? And any factors that could change the growth going forward for research and development spending for you guys? Thanks. Look, maybe I can comment on the -- how we think about R&D. And look, if anything, I think two things. We are always committed to driving deep computer science research and innovation. That's the foundation on which the Company is built. And taking that and applying it and building new products and services and generating value is the virtuous cycle. And nothing changes in that fundamental thesis.
We are definitely, both -- as Ruth mentioned, on AI investments, we are going to be committed to making sure we invest to realize the opportunity. But all the work we are doing on efficiency and optimization applies to -- on the AI side as well. And so we're bringing all that lens there so that we do this responsibly. But no overall changes in our philosophy or approach there. And maybe I'll let Philipp comment on the overall market dynamics. Yes. Look, I can't comment on others, but our focus continues, obviously, to be helping customers through whatever uncertainty or complexity they're facing, and a lot of companies are focused on profitability, driving efficiencies, and they're carefully evaluating the effectiveness of their budgets. And our goal is really to help them maximize efficiency and drive strong ROI. And I think we have the proven AI-powered tools and solutions to actually do it. I called out Search and Other revenues being led by solid growth in the retail vertical. We talked about the DR and brand side on the YouTube side. I think those are the key points I would make. The next question comes from Ken Gawrelski of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Can I ask on Performance Max? You've had great success there. Could you talk about any vertical or use case expansions? And how long until we possibly get to the point of more automated AI-generated creative in production? Yes. Look, this is a great question. AI is a foundational component that really allows us to help users advertise those pubs partners at scale. And we've been on a journey for years, right, to take the key components of advertising, whether it's bidding, targeting and creatives as well as innovation, frankly, in the core advertiser and publisher experiences and improve them dramatically through AI.
And Performance Max is an example of how all this comes together at scale for advertisers. They provide us with a business goal, of assets, and we can then take care of the rest to meet consumer demand and really deliver on advertiser ROI. And as you heard it at GML, we've seen over many quarters, we continue to build new AI features really on top of this.
I think I talked a bit in my prepared remarks about where we're taking some of our products from a gen AI perspective. And if you take a look at some of the things we announced there, it's fair to say, whether you look at our revamped asset creation flow in Performance Max, whether you look at Automatically Created Assets, whether you look at Product Studio and so on, there we're on a right path to deliver some really exciting new innovation in automated -- let me call it, asset creation in the broader sense. Our last question comes from Mark Mahaney of Evercore. Please go ahead. Okay. Actually, I'll follow up on that last question, Philipp. You pointed out AI has been used to improve the advertising mousetrap at Google for many years. Do you view generative AI as just a material accelerant of your ability to improve return on ad spend for the millions of marketers who use Google? And if you think about where generative AI would have the most impact, could you peel it apart, what's your guess now over the next couple of years where it's going to have the most impact on the creative, on the audience creation, on the campaign optimization? Where do you think the most impact will come from generative AI, just for all the -- your advertising customers? Thanks. Look, as I said earlier, generative AI is supercharging new and existing ads products with really tons of potential ahead. And we're really helping advertisers here make better decisions, solve problems, enhance creativity. And I covered this earlier. For example, we launched a new conversational experience in Google Ads, the asset creation flow in PMax. I mentioned the Automatically Created Assets, the Product Studio and so on.
When I talk to customers, they're very excited about AI, and understandably, have some questions. One of the top questions is, for example, what's the next best step I should take. And this is a key reason why we launched our Google Ads AI Essentials, which was a big announcement at GML. It's a checklist of simple steps customers can take right now to unlock the power of AI, and it has to do with the foundation of data and measurement. It has to do with taking action with our AI products and really is a mindset shift to set up organizations for AI success.
So those are just some of the examples. If you extrapolate those going forward, those are some of the examples where I see a lot of upside, apart from the points that Sundar already mentioned. And I think all of this is before we have multimodal capabilities really in the mix. And so, looking at the early innovations there, I think it's going to be an exciting couple of years ahead. Thanks, Mark. Thanks, Sundar. Thank you, Philipp. Congratulations, Ruth. Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any further remarks. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter 2023 call.

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler and Ruth Porat.
Now I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations and financial performance may be considered forward-looking. Such statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. Please refer to our Form 10-K, including our Risk Factors section and our Form 10-Q. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.
During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. Our comments will be on year-over-year comparisons unless we state otherwise.
And now, I'll turn the call over to Sundar. Thank you, Jim, and hello, everyone. I'm pleased with our business results this quarter, which demonstrates strong growth in Search and YouTube and momentum in Cloud. Google turned 25 in September, which offered an opportunity to reflect on our progress over the last quarter century and to look ahead to the opportunities enabled by AI we are so excited and confident about.
Our product momentum continued this quarter, as you saw with Cloud Next made on YouTube and made by Google. It's all part of our focus on making AI more helpful for everyone, and we are making good progress across the 4 areas that we shared last quarter.
First, improving knowledge and learning. This includes our work with the Search Generative Experience, which is our experiment to bring generative AI capabilities into Search. We have learned a lot from people trying it, and we have added new capabilities like incorporating videos and images into responses and generating imagery. We have also made it easier to understand and debug generated code. Direct user feedback has been positive with strong growth in adoption. In August, we opened up availability to India and Japan with more countries and languages to come. As we add features and expand into new markets, we are engaging with the broader ecosystem, and we'll continue to prioritize approaches that add value for our users, send valuable traffic to publishers and support a healthy open Internet.
With generative AI applied to Search, we can serve a wider range of information needs and answer new types of questions, including those that benefit from multiple perspectives. We are surfacing more links with SGE and linking to a wider range of sources on the results page, creating new opportunities for content to be discovered. Of course, ads will continue to play an important role in this new Search experience. People are finding ads helpful here as they provide useful options to take action and connect with businesses. We'll experiment with new formats native to SGE that use generative AI to create relevant, high-quality ads customized to every step of the Search journey.
The second area we are focused on is boosting creativity and productivity. Bard is particularly helpful here. It's a direct interface to a conversational LLM and we think of it as an early experiment and complementary experience to Google Search. Bard can now integrate with Google apps and services showing relevant information from Workspace, Maps, YouTube and Google Flights and Hotels.
We've also improved the Google IT feature. It provides other sources to help people evaluate Bard's responses and explore information across the web. Earlier this month, we announced Assistant with Bard, a personal assistant powered by generative AI. It combines Bard's generative and reasoning capabilities with Assistant's personalized help. You can interact with it through text, voice or images. And in the coming months, you'll be able to opt in on Android and iOS mobile devices. Our collaborative tools in Workspace and YouTube are also part of how we boost creativity and productivity, and they are seeing great initial traction.
Third, we are enabling developers, businesses and other organizations to build their own transformative products and services. For example, thousands of customers and partners are already using Google Cloud to capture the potential of AI, and we'll share more there in a minute.
And fourth, we are building and deploying AI responsibly so that everyone can benefit. One area we are focused on is making sure people can more easily identify when they are encountering AI-generated content online, using new technology powered by Google DeepMind SynthID, images generated by Vertex AI can be watermarked in a way that is invisible to the human eye without reducing the image quality. Underlying all this work is the foundational research done by our teams at Google DeepMind and Google Research. We are excited to roll out more of what they've been working on soon.
As we expand access to our new AI services, we continue to make meaningful investments in support of our AI efforts. We remain committed to durably reengineering our cost base in order to help create capacity for these investments in support of long-term sustainable financial value. Across Alphabet, teams are looking at ways to operate as effectively as possible focused on their biggest priorities.
Turning next to YouTube, which saw solid momentum in both its ads and subscription businesses in Q3. NFL Sunday Ticket is now live in receiving excellent reviews. Fans love our multi-view feature, which can live stream up to 4 games on a single screen. We have heard positive feedback from our partners at the NFL about the new features and live stream reliability. This is a clear example of our ability to execute big partnerships with excellence and at scale.
I'm really pleased with the growth and engagement on YouTube Shorts. We continue to work on closing the monetization gap here. Shorts now average over 70 billion daily views and are watched by over 2 billion signed-in users every month. At Made On YouTube in September, we announced new tools that make it easier to create engaging content. Dream Screen is an experimental feature that allows creators to add AI-generated video or image backgrounds to Shorts. And YouTube Create is a new mobile app with a suite of production tools for editing Shorts, longer videos or both.
Next, Google Cloud. We see continued growth with Q3 revenue of $8.4 billion, up 22%. Today, more than 60% of the world's 1,000 largest companies or Google Cloud customers. At Cloud Next, we showcased amazing innovations across our entire portfolio of infrastructure, data and AI, workspace collaboration and cybersecurity solutions. We offer advanced AI optimized infrastructure to train and serve models at scale. And today, more than half of all funded generative AI start-ups are Google Cloud customers. This includes AI21 Labs, Contextual, Elemental Cognition, Writer and more. We continue to provide the widest choice of accelerator options. Our A3 VMs powered by NVIDIA's H100 GPU are generally available, and we are winning customers with Cloud TPU v5e, our most cost efficient and versatile accelerator to date.
On top of our infrastructure, our Vertex AI platform helps customers build, deploy and scale AI-powered applications. We offer more than 100 models, including popular third-party and open source models, as well as tools to quickly build Search in conversation use cases. From Q2 to Q3, the number of active generative AI projects on Vertex AI grew by 7x, including Highmark Health, which is creating more personalized member materials.
Duet AI was created using Google's leading large foundation models and is specially trained to help users to be more productive on Google Cloud. We continue expanding its capabilities and integrating it across a wide range of cloud products and services. With Duet AI, we are helping leading brands like PayPal and Deutsche Bank boost developer productivity, and we are enabling retailers like Aritzia and Gymshark to gain new insights for better and faster business results. In fact, companies are increasingly using AI for the purpose of finalizing data, and customers are choosing Google Cloud because we are the only large cloud provider with a unified platform to analyze structured and unstructured data.
In Workspace, thousands of companies and more than 1 million trusted testers have used Duet AI. They are writing and refining content in Gmail and Docs, creating original images from text within slides, organizing data and sheets and more. These innovations enable us to provide new services and grow our base of 10 million paying customers including enterprises like Grupo Boticário, Unilever and Warner Music.
We also integrated Duet AI across our cybersecurity portfolio to differentiate in the marketplace, providing generative AI-powered assistance in Mandiant Threat Intelligence, Chronicle Security Operations and Security Command Center. This reduces the time security teams spend writing, running and refining searches by 7x. We are the only leading security provider that combines frontline intelligence and expertise, a modern security operations platform and a trusted cloud foundation, all infused with generative AI, helping product customers and partners like BT, Jack Henry and Associates and CoverMyMeds.
Turning to Hardware. We unveiled our new products this month. We introduced our new Pixel 8, Pixel 8 Pro and Pixel Watch 2 to very positive consumer feedback and reviews. Pixel is the fastest-growing smartphone brand in our top markets and the only one that grew in units sold year-over-year. Our portfolio of Pixel products are brought to life, thanks to our combination of foundational technologies AI, Android and Google Tensor. Google Tensor G3 is the third generation of our tailor-built chip. It's designed to power transformative experiences by bringing the latest in Google AI research directly to our newest phones.
A new AI-powered editing feature in Google photos on Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro remote distractions, generate the best shot from multiple images and reduce distracting sounds in videos. Pixel and our third-party ecosystem are powered by Android. We just released Android 14 with more accessibility features.
I also want to mention Chromebook Plus, a new category which provides the best of Chrome on great hardware with built-in Google apps and powerful AI capabilities. We also shared that Chromebooks will now get regular automatic updates for 10 years, more than any other operating system.
In Other Bets, Waymo is onboarding more riders to its commercial ride-hailing service as it gradually adds over 100,000 people from its San Francisco waitlist. Austin will follow as its next ride-hail city. Wing and Walmart announced a new partnership to provide drone delivery service in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
Before handing over to Philipp, I want to thank our employees around the world who are working to create innovative products and provide great services to people and businesses who use our products. Philipp? Thanks, Sundar, and hi, everyone. I'll start with our performance for the quarter and then give color into the 3 key priority areas for ads, Google AI, Retail and YouTube, that we've identified on past calls as opportunities for long-term growth and advertising.
Google Services revenues of $68 billion were up 11% year-on-year. In Google advertising, Search and other revenues grew 11% year-on-year led by solid growth in the retail vertical. In YouTube ads, revenues were up 12% year-on-year driven by growth in both brand and direct response. In Network, revenues declined 3% year-on-year. Google other revenues were up 21% year-on-year led by strong growth in YouTube subscription revenues.
Let's start with Google AI. Recent dramatic advances in everything from foundational research models to LLMs to generative AI are improving our ability to deliver better performance and profitability for advertisers and more helpful, delightful experiences for users.
We covered many innovations last quarter after GML like our conversational experience in Google Ads, significant updates to Performance Max and new campaign types like demand gen. And as Sundar said, we're continuing to experiment with new ad formats on SGE. It's extremely important to us that in this new experience, advertisers still have the opportunity to reach potential customers along their search journeys. I'll highlight more ways we're innovating with the best of Google AI as we double-click into our core business.
In retail, we had a great quarter. In a market where every dollar counts, our proven AI-powered solutions like Search and PMax are helping retailers drive reliable, strong ROI and meet customers wherever they are across the funnel. In Q3, we also started prepping retailers for what will be a long holiday season. Let me share some things.
Number one, with the maximum number of days between Thanksgiving and Christmas and expectations for many micro peaks beyond Cyber 5, we're arming businesses with insights and planning tools, including opti score and Performance Planner to uncover new opportunities, plan budgets and targets to stay competitive and be smarter with their inventory and pricing strategy.
Number two, consumer expectations are shifting, especially around price and convenience. We've seen 4x deals queries during the holidays versus other periods. 75% of users say they'll shop with those offering free shipping. Retailers are capitalizing on these trends with our differentiated merchant offerings like merchant promotions and fulfillment options. And we're making improvements to significantly boost the number of deals shown to shoppers in Search this holiday season. Look out for more in the coming days about new ways we'll help shoppers browse deals across the web this year.
Number three, no surprise, omnichannel is the way to succeed. With our suite of omni product solutions, including local inventory ads, omni bidding and PMax for store goals, retailers, big and small, are capturing demand and incremental store budgets while engaging with high-value customers.
Innovation continues across our shopping and merchant experiences powered by Google AI. Our virtual try-on tool for apparel launched in June and has been a hit with consumers and brands. Users engage with virtual try-on images at a higher rate versus regular brand-provided images.
Product Studio is another launch from GML getting positive feedback in pilot mode. It is the best of gen AI to help businesses create unique and tailored imagery for free that they can then scale across their channels. We're seeing early merchant testers using it to seasonalize their content for the holidays.
Let's shift to YouTube. It's worth repeating our intense focus on creator success, coupled with our multi-format strategy, are at the center of how we think about YouTube's long-term growth. Shorts Connected TV and our subscription offerings are key drivers here, and we're investing across each to solidify YouTube's position as the best place to create, the best place to watch and the best place to deliver results.
Sundar mentioned watch time and engagement momentum on Shorts as well as our monetization progress. He also covered subscription growth and NFL Sunday Ticket. As for Connected TV, we continue to be the #1 overall streaming destination according to Nielsen. 150 million-plus people are watching YouTube on CTV screens every month in the U.S.
Whether it's music videos, NFL Sunday Ticket, free movies shorts, a continuous stream of Mr. Beast or some other creator-led content, viewers want choice and variety, and we're giving it to them all in one place. And to help creators and advertisers connect with these billions of viewers across moments, screens and formats, we're bringing Google AI to awesome new creation tools and ad solutions.
AI will do wonders for creation and storytelling. From Dream Screen and YouTube Create, which Sundar talked about, to features that audit up content in multiple languages, flip interim existing assets, remix and clip videos and more, we're just getting started.
We're also helping brands break through its speed and scale across the funnel to drive results. Spotlight Moments launched last week. It uses AI to identify trending content around major cultural moments for brand sponsorship opportunities. There's video reach campaigns, which are expanding to in-feed and Shorts, and will be generally available in November. AI is helping advertisers find as many people as possible and their ideal audience for the lowest possible price. Early tests are delivering 54% more reach at 42% lower cost. And then with video view campaigns, AI is serving skippable ads across in-stream, in-feed and Shorts and helping advertisers earn the maximum number of views at the lowest possible cost. So far, they're driving 40% more views on average versus in-stream alone.
Then for YouTube and other feed-based services, there's our new demand-gen campaign, which launched in April, rolled out worldwide last week and was designed for the needs of today's social marketers to engage people as they stream, scroll and connect. It combines video and image ads in one campaign with access to 3 billion users across YouTube and Google and the ability to optimize and measure across the funnel using Google AI. Demand gen is already driving successful brands like Samsung and Toyota.
Before I wrap, one quick highlight on our close collaboration and commitment to our most important ecosystems and partners. In July, we launched Google News Showcase in the U.S., our curated online news experience and licensing program with more than 150 news publications, 90% of which are local or regional. Globally, over 2,500 news publications have signed on to News Showcase and the product is live in 23 countries today. Our commitment to open access to news and information remains strong.
With that, I'll end with a thank you to our customers and partners around the world for their continued trust and collaboration and our Googlers everywhere for their incredible hard work and dedication.
Ruth, over to you. Thank you, Philipp. We are very pleased with our financial results for the third quarter, driven by meaningful growth in Search in YouTube and Momentum in Cloud. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter, unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook.
For the third quarter, our consolidated revenues were $76.7 billion, up 11% in both reported and constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth. In terms of expenses, total cost of revenues was $33.2 billion, up 7%, primarily reflecting other cost of revenues of $20.6 billion, which was up 6%. Growth here was primarily driven by content acquisition costs mainly for YouTube subscription offerings.
As noted in our earnings release, the overall increase in data center and other operations costs was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in estimated useful lives we made starting in the first quarter of the year.
Operating expenses were $22.1 billion, up 6%, reflecting the following: first, an increase in R&D expenses driven primarily by compensation; second, an increase in G&A expenses, reflecting the impact of charges related to legal matters; and finally, sales and marketing expenses, which were relatively flat to last year.
Operating income was $21.3 billion, up 25%, and our operating margin was 28%. Other income and expense was a loss of $146 million. Net income was $19.7 billion. This reflects an effective tax rate of 7% in the third quarter from an IRS change related to the use of foreign tax credits, which had an outsized impact on the third quarter rate because the change resulted in a catch-up for prior periods.
We delivered free cash flow of $22.6 billion in the third quarter and $78 million for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with $120 billion in cash and marketable securities. As a reminder, our cash balance and free cash flow in the second and third quarters benefited from the deferral of certain tax payments to the fourth quarter of 2023. As noted in our earnings release, on October 16, we made an estimated tax payment of $10.5 billion related to this deferral, which will be reflected in our cash balance and free cash flow in the fourth quarter.
Turning to segment results. Within Google Services, revenues were $68 billion, up 11%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $44 billion in the quarter were up 11% led again by growth in retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $8 billion were up 12% driven by both brand advertising and direct response. Network advertising revenues of $7.7 billion were down 3%. Other revenues were $8.3 billion, up 21%, primarily reflecting growth in YouTube nonadvertising revenues driven by subscriber growth in YouTube TV followed by YouTube Music Premium. TAC was $12.6 billion, up 7%. Google Services operating income was $23.9 billion, up 27%, and the operating margin was 35%.
Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $8.4 billion for the quarter, up 22%. GCP revenue growth remained strong across geographies, industries and products, although the Q3 year-on-year growth rate reflects the impact of customer optimization efforts. Google Workspace also delivered strong revenue growth, primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had operating income of $266 million, and the operating margin was 3%. As to our Other Bets, for the third quarter, revenues were $297 million and the operating loss was $1.2 billion.
Turning to our outlook for the business with respect to Google Services.
First, within advertising. After a period of historic volatility, we were pleased with the year-on-year revenue growth of Search and YouTube advertising in the third quarter.
Second, within other revenues. In our YouTube subscription products the substantial growth in revenues primarily reflects subscriber growth. Looking ahead, a full quarter of NFL Sunday Ticket revenues as well as associated content acquisition costs will be reflected in Q4 results compared to only a few weeks in the third quarter.
Play had solid growth in the third quarter driven primarily by an increase in the number of buyers.
With respect to Hardware, there is a headwind to revenues in the fourth quarter, reflecting efforts to optimize the portfolio with tighter targeting of our go-to-market investments as well as the ongoing impact from the difference in launch timing for the Pixel 6A and 7A that we mentioned last quarter.
Turning to Google Cloud. We are pleased with the ongoing customer engagement with GCP and Workspace and the potential benefit of our AI solutions, including infrastructure and services such as Vertex AI and Duet. We continue to invest aggressively given the significant potential we see while remaining focused on profitable growth.
In terms of expenses and profitability, we're pleased with our operating performance. As we have repeatedly stressed, we remain focused on durably reengineering our cost base to create investment capacity to support our growth priorities, most important of which is with AI. We have a number of work streams in place.
First, we are maintaining a slower pace of head count growth, reflecting product prioritization and reallocation of talent to support our most important growth opportunities.
Second, we remain focused on optimizing our real estate footprint, including how and where we work to reduce our expense growth. As you can see from our earnings release, we incurred $207 million in accelerated rent and depreciation in the third quarter related to these actions.
Third, we have engineering work streams underway to improve productivity across Alphabet. Given the magnitude of investment in our technical infrastructure, we have a superb team focused on efficiency of our operations there. We are also making progress in streamlining operations across Alphabet through the use of AI.
Finally, there are ongoing work streams that are improving the efficiency of our spend with suppliers and vendors through our central procurement organization. And to be clear, across the portfolio of Other Bet companies, we have also been working to identify opportunities to create sharper focus and to operate more efficiently and effectively.
With respect to sequential quarter-on-quarter trends, two further points. First, cost of sales in the fourth quarter will reflect both higher Hardware costs given Pixel family launches as well as increased CAC for YouTube as previously noted. Second, as usual, we expect sales and marketing expenses to be more heavily weighted to the end of the year, in part to support product launches and the holiday season. Finally, our reported CapEx in Q3 was $8 billion driven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure with the largest component for servers followed by data centers, reflecting a meaningful increase in our investments in AI compute.
The growth in reported cash CapEx in Q3 is somewhat muted due to the timing of supplier payments which can cause variability from quarter-to-quarter. We continue to invest meaningfully in the technical infrastructure needed to support the opportunities we see in AI across Alphabet and expect elevated levels of investment, increasing in the fourth quarter of 2023 and continuing to grow in 2024.
In closing, we remain very excited about the opportunities ahead and committed to deliver sustainable financial value.
Thank you. Sundar, Philipp and I will now take your questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. I have two. The first one, maybe just a little bit of a jump ball. There's somewhat of an investor debate about sort of the incremental return on capital to Search when it comes to AI. I know it's early, but are there any examples that you're seeing with SGE or Bard on higher utility, higher conversion rates, more engagement, just something to sort of show signal around the return that could come from these investments?
And the second one, Ruth, I know you've spoken a lot about durably reengineering the cost base. I think in the past, you've talked about how expenses could grow slower than revenue in 2024. Is that sort of still the high level way to think about it? Or is that potentially changing a bit as investments are continuing? Ruth, do you want to take the second part? I'll take the first. Sure. Thanks for that, Brian. So overall, that's sort of a truism, as you know well, looking to grow revenues at a faster rate than expenses as we're focused on delivering sustainable financial value. And so that really takes us to the work streams, which I tried to tick through. Again, those remain the driver. They're the real priority. Those are the efforts that are going to enable us to expense growth. And it's moderated as possible while supporting the investment growth that is so exciting in front of us, in particular, around AI. And to your first part, obviously, we see AI as a foundational platform shift and are excited about the opportunities across our business. It starts with Search. And I've been pretty pleased with how the user feedback has been on SGE. We are rolling it out to more users. Through it all, we are making sure the product works well, and we are generating value for our ecosystem, and that adds transitions well. And I think I view this as, with AI, the opportunity to evolve Search and Assistant over the next decade ahead. And I think as we've always seen, when you continue to invest and build great experiences, you can get value on the other side. And I do think over time, there will be newer paths, just like we have done on YouTube. I think with the AI work, there are subscription models as a possible path as well. And obviously, all of the AI investments we are doing applies across Cloud, too, and I'm pretty optimistic about what's ahead there as well. Your next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. One for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar, you talked a lot about AI. I was hoping you could talk more about Gemini and how it will differentiate from other models some of the multimodal capabilities and what new experiences or agents do you think it could unlock and how we should think about timing? And then also just on Cloud, hoping you can talk about some of the factors there on the decel in cloud and just what you're seeing in terms of optimizations? And is there any sign of new workload deployments taking place? Thanks. Good questions. On Gemini, obviously, it's effort from our combined Google DeepMind team. I'm very excited at the progress there as we're working through getting the model ready. To me, more importantly, we are just really laying the foundation of what I think of as the next-generation series of models we'll be launching throughout 2024. The pace of innovation is extraordinarily impressive to see. We are creating it from the ground up to be multimodal, highly efficient tool and API integrations and, more importantly, laying the platform to enable future innovations as well.
And we are developing Gemini in a way that it is going to be available at various sizes and capabilities, and we'll be using it immediately across all our products internally as well as bringing it out to both developers and cloud customers through Vertex. So I view it as a journey, and each generation is going to be better than the other. And we are definitely investing, and the early results are very promising.
On Cloud, maybe what I would say is, overall, we had definitely started seeing customers looking to optimize spend. We leaned into it to help customers given some of the challenges they were facing. And so that was a factor. But we are definitely seeing a lot of interest in AI. There are many, many projects underway now. Just on Vertex alone, the number of projects grew over 7x. And so we see signs of stabilization, and I'm optimistic about what's ahead. Your next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Two, if I could. Sundar, you guys led over a year ago, starting with Performance Max. And I wanted to know if we could get your updated thoughts on how AI might impact the broader advertising industry and how you're aligning Alphabet and Google's goals with AI and where it might take the advertising industry in the years ahead. That would be the first question.
And then about a year ago, Philipp and Ruth started talking about some of the brand advertising headwinds that YouTube was facing. As we start to lap those headwinds, how should we be thinking about a broad recovery in brand advertising versus elements of still headwinds that are being faced in the broader ad space, specifically with YouTube? So maybe I'd take the first one. We're very pleased with how Performance Max is performing. It gives advertisers really maximum performance across all inventory from, one, really AI-powered campaign, and it's probably the ultimate example of AI in action across our ads product. It's delivering excellent ROI. Those using it achieve like, on average, over 18% more conversions at a similar cost per action. So since rolling it out 2 years ago, we've continued to expand the features, give advertisers additional ways to steer how it works and do a lot of things like account-level negative keywords, other details here.
We launched new life cycle goals, customer life cycle goals, we call them; a revamped asset creation flow that really helps business adapt and scale their most successful creatives. I think that's one to watch. We will also continue to build other new PMax features based on all the advertiser feedback we're seeing. So we're very, very encouraged by the progress here.
Overall, maybe -- there was a second part to your question a bit, on what we're hearing from the customers out there. Look, driving ROI and efficiency is still top of mind for many, right? It's a rapidly shifting and still quite unpredictable consumer landscape out there. Our AI tools are very well received, AI, gen AI are top of mind for everybody, really. There's a ton of excitement, lots of questions about it. Many understand the value. Nearly 80% of our advertisers already use at least one AI-powered search ads product. And yes, we're hearing a lot of good feedback on, number one, our ads AI Essentials, which are really helping to unlock the power of AI and set up for durable ROI growth on the advertiser side, this is -- those are products like the foundation for data and measurement, things like Google Tech, consent mode and so on; and obviously, Search and PMax, we talked about it; and then all the gen AI products, all those different ones. So there's a whole lot of interest in those products, yes. And then on to your second question regarding YouTube, as we said, overall year-on-year growth in revenues was driven by both brand advertising and direct response. But very much to your question, yes, there was a stabilization in spending by advertisers. We're really pleased about that. We're particularly pleased about the ongoing performance in the Living Room and on Shorts. And as I said, that's both watch time growth and monetization. I'd say the other thing benefiting YouTube is the retail strength we talked about with Search, retail strength in APAC in both Search and YouTube. And that really began in the second quarter, continued in the third quarter, but that was another contributor. So quite a number of things going on. I feel good about the results the team was able to deliver here. Your next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with UBS. Two, if I can. First, as we just think about the rollout of SGE across the user base, like how far along is that? And how do you balance the product rollout and consumer uptake versus monetization in that transition?
And then the second one, also sort of generative AI related, how quickly are you guys finding new ways of optimizing whether that's shrinking model sizes, chip efficiencies or anything else? And do you think overall capital intensity of the business scales up or do you just find ways to do this more efficiently as usage scales? Anything you could share there would be great. On the first part about SGE, we are still in very, very early days in terms of how much we have rolled it out, but we have definitely gotten it out to enough people both geographically across user segments and enough to know that the product is working well, it improves the experience and -- but there are areas to improve, which we are fine-tuning. Our true north here is getting at the right user experience we want to, and I'm pretty comfortable seeing the trajectory. And we've always worked through these transitions, be it from desktop to mobile or from now mobile to AI and then to experience. And so it's nothing new. And I feel very comfortable that as we go through it, the strength of our teams, both on the organic side as well as at site, to drive the right experience for users, including ads, will pay dividends. And I think we'll continue to make improvements and make progress there.
On your second question, at a high level, I would say, all through the -- we just celebrated 25 years. And of all the things I was proud about, when I looked at the strength of the work we have done across our infrastructure as a company, our technical infrastructure as a company, and various given stages, at a given moment in time when we adopted new generations of technology, we have looked at the cost of it. But then the curves, the efficiency curves, we have driven on top of it has always been phenomenal to see. And I see the current moment as no different. Already through this year, we are driving significant efficiencies both in our models, in training costs and serving costs and our ability to adapt what's needed to the right use case. And so I think we'll do everything that is needed to make sure we have the leading AI models and infrastructure in the world, bar none, and we'll continue driving efficiencies from there. Your next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. I'm going to ask you guys a multipart question on YouTube TV. So firstly, what were the broader objectives for getting Sunday Ticket? How does it perform versus those objectives? What lessons have you learned from having the NFL Sunday Ticket? How does that affect your appetite for more sports going forward? So as Sundar said earlier, we're several weeks into our first season, and we're very pleased with how it's going. I think, in the broader context, you have to look at it as an overall YouTube subscription strategy. The great feedback we've gotten so far in the YouTube experience is very, very significant. People love the navigation. They love multi-view, they love the chats and the polls. And frankly, people are very happy with the lack of latency here. The #1 piece of concrete feedback the team has gotten is actually that people want the ability to pick their own games from multi-view, which is multi-view is the awesome feature we started rolling out on YouTube TV, that gives sense to the ability to basically watch multiple streams at once. And yes, overall, the teams are working hard to build a fantastic experience, and we are really trying to stay focused on getting our first season right and providing the best possible experience really for fans here. Your next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America. A couple of questions on Q4. Can you provide any color if there's been any pause in advertising around the Middle East conflict in October, anything we should be aware of for Q4?
And then second, when we do think about the Sunday Ticket impact, I know you can't give us revenues or expenses, but overall, would that be a headwind to margins in Q4 or something we should be thinking about? So look, on the first question, obviously, this is tragic. There are no words to talk about what's going on. And all of our focus has been on supporting our people there and how our products can be as helpful as possible in this very painful time broadly, and so nothing really to add.
And then in terms of the second question, Sunday Ticket, the only thing I tried to call out there is that clearly, this is the first full quarter of Sunday Ticket that is contributing overall to the subscription revenues that we see. That's in part of other revenues. Also, obviously, it is contributing to higher CAC in the fourth quarter. So we try to make that really clear. And as we look longer term, we expect to generate an attractive return over the life of the deal. We're continuing to invest in support of this and excited about the additional opportunities that come out of it, working with partners to deliver clips and other opportunities.
As we've said, we've heard positive feedback from our partners at the NFL about the new features and live stream reliability. And this is really a clear example of our ability to execute big partnerships with excellence at scale and really leverage a lot of the extraordinary magic at YouTube and across Google, and that's what we're excited about. Your next question comes from Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo. Two questions, if I may. First, how do you think about the future structure of AI-driven Search capabilities? Will activity remain centralized in a search bar or will it be decentralized and present in many different applications, including on third-party applications? You alluded to Bard being integrated into multiple Google experiences earlier in the call.
And then the second question is, any update on the Chrome cookie deprecation plan to begin in 1Q '24? What have you seen so far based on your early testing of Privacy Sandbox? And what advertiser feedback have you received? On your first question, look, I broadly think of it as people are looking for information. They always look for it in many, many different ways. We've given the product search example. People can directly go to Amazon, as an example, or come to Google. So if you zoom back and take an information view of the world, there's always been many different ways to get it. And part of our work we do in making Search be world-class and give users what they're looking for is so that we can get as much of that intent as possible. So I don't see that changing. With mobile, there were more ways people could get information, but we worked out to make Search work better in the mobile world. And similarly, a view with AI, there'll be many ways people get information, but it also offers us an opportunity in Search and in Assistant to take it to the next level and answer use cases, which we couldn't have done before, and expand the diverse set of needs where we are sourced. So that's how I see the opportunity ahead. And to the second part of your question, yes, Chrome still plans to begin phasing out third-party cookies in the second half of '24. In the last several months, Chrome has really made significant progress on the Privacy Sandbox with APIs for developer testing, and they're now generally available in Chrome. Our ads team is testing these APIs. And as we shared back in April, the preliminary results of our interest-based ads testing showed that a combination of what we call privacy preserving signals and AI optimization actually provides positive results for businesses preparing for a cookie-less future.
We also recently announced that in Q1 of '24, we plan to deprecate third-party cookies for 1% of Chrome users, and this will support developers, obviously, in conducting their real-world experiments to assess the readiness and effectiveness of their products without third-party cookies. And we're overall encouraged by the ecosystem engagement on Privacy Sandbox. We'll continue to work with the industry and regulators in how these technologies can support the transition to, frankly, a more private web. And our last question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Two questions, please. Ruth, you talked about these elevated levels of investments in Q4 and in '24. I'm sorry, were you referring to just CapEx or CapEx and total expenses? And then on the comments around stabilization in Cloud, is this something that you just started to see in the September quarter? Or had you seen that starting earlier in the year? And if you just started seeing it in the September quarter, would you have any thoughts on why you would have seen it, like Google Cloud would have seen it maybe later than some of the other hyperscalers? So I think what you're referring to is my CapEx comment. I was trying to make the point that we are committed to meaningfully investing in CapEx given all the opportunities we see. We do continue to expect elevated levels of investment in our technical infrastructure. It will be increasing in the fourth quarter. And I talked about some of the difference in timing, muted timing, in the third quarter due to the timing of supplier payments and then tried to make it clear that we will continue to grow CapEx in 2024. Or more specifically, to your question, 2024 aggregate CapEx will be above the full year 2023. So that was the main one.
And then as it relates to Cloud, as Sundar said, what we're really excited about is the revenue growth does reflect healthy customer adoption across the portfolio, and that's infrastructure, data analytics and security. And so I can't comment on others, but we feel good about where we're sitting here looking forward, and we'll let you do the forecasting. GCP growth in the third quarter was above the growth rate for Cloud overall, and we feel really good about the work that they're doing there. And then, of course, in addition to that is all of the contribution from Google Workspace. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any further remarks. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again in our fourth quarter 2023 call.

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler and Ruth Porat.
Now I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations and financial performance may be considered forward-looking. Such statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. Please refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q, including the risk factors discussed in our upcoming Form 10-K filing for the year ended December 31, 2023.

During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. Our comments will be on year-over-year comparisons unless we state otherwise.
And now I'll turn the call over to Sundar. Hello, everyone. Our results reflect strong momentum and product innovation continuing into 2024. Today, I'm going to talk about 4 main topics: one, our investments in AI, including how it's helping Search; two, subscriptions, which reached $15 billion in annual revenue, up 5x since 2019. Subscription is growing strongly powered by YouTube Premium and Music, YouTube TV and Google One; three, cloud, which crossed $9 billion in revenues this quarter and saw accelerated growth driven by our GenAI and product leadership; and four, our investments and focus to meet the growth opportunities ahead.
First, AI and Search. As you know, we have long led the way in using AI to improve many of our products from Search to Ads to most of our consumer and enterprise products, helping billions of people already. Last year brought new excitement around GenAI, and I'm proud of how we responded responsibly with deep advances in foundation models and a number of great launches.
We closed the year by launching the Gemini era, a new industry-leading series of models that will fuel the next generation of advances. Gemini is the first realization of the vision we had when we formed Google DeepMind, bringing together our 2 world-class research teams. It's engineered to understand and combine text, images, audio, video and code in a natively multimodal way, and it can run on everything from mobile devices to data centers.
Gemini gives us a great foundation. It's already demonstrating state-of-the-art capabilities, and it's only going to get better. Gemini Ultra is coming soon. The team is already working on the next versions and bringing it to our products.
That starts with Search. We are already experimenting with Gemini in Search, where it's making our Surge Generative Experience, or SGE, faster for users. We have seen a 40% reduction in latency in English in the U.S. I'm happy with what we are seeing in the earliest days of SGE. It's available through Search Labs in 7 languages.
By applying generative AI to Search we are able to serve a wider range of information needs and answer new types of questions, including those that benefit from multiple perspectives. People are finding it particularly useful for more complex questions like comparisons or longer queries. It's also helpful in areas where people are looking for deeper understanding, such as education or even gift ideas.
We are improving satisfaction, including answers for more conversational and intricate queries. As I mentioned earlier, we are surfacing more links with SGE and linking to a wider range of sources on the Results page, and we'll continue to prioritize approaches that add value for our users and send valuable traffic to publishers.
Beyond SGE, we are continuing to use AI to make searching more accessible and intuitive. Circle to search let's you search what you see on Android phones with a simple gesture without switching gaps. It's available starting this week on Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro and the new Samsung Galaxy S24 Series.
and Lens now offers generative AI overviews. You can add text to a visual search to ask questions about anything you see and get AI-powered insights in the moment. In addition to Search, we are also seeing a lot of interest in our AI-powered solutions for advertisers. That includes our new conversational experience that uses Gemini to accelerate the creation of search campaigns.
Then there is Bard, our conversational AI tool that complements Search. It's now powered by Gemini Pro and is much more capable at things like understanding, summarizing, reasoning, coding and planning. It's now in over 40 languages and over 230 countries around the world. Looking ahead, we'll be rolling out an even more advanced version for subscribers powered by Gemini Ultra.
That's a good segue to subscriptions. As I said earlier, it's now a $15 billion business annually. YouTube is the key driver of our subscription revenues. Available in over 100 countries and regions, YouTube Music and Premium have real momentum. They're engaging passionate users and driving great returns for the music industry and creators.
YouTube TV is also doing well. We've had great consumer feedback on the viewing experience. People love the navigation, multiview and unlimited DVR. NFL Sunday Ticket has found its perfect home on YouTube, and Philipp will talk about that more.
Let me also talk about our subscription service, Google One. It's doing incredibly well with strong user growth. It provides expanded storage, unlocks exclusive features in Google products and allows us to build a strong relationship with our most engaged users. Google One is growing very well, and we are just about to cross 100 million subscribers. From here, we are going to bring in more AI features and look forward to more strong growth to come.
Next, Google Cloud. Throughout 2023, we introduced thousands of product advances, including broad GenAI capabilities across our AI infrastructure, our Vertex AI platform and our new Duet AI agents. In Q4, our product and GenAI leadership enabled us to win and expand relationships with many leading brands, including Hugging Face, McDonald's, Motorola Mobility and Verizon.
Google Cloud offers our AI Hypercomputer, a groundbreaking supercomputing architecture that combines our powerful TPUs and GPUs, AI software and multi-slice and multi-host technology to provide performance and cost advantages for training and serving models. Customers like Antropic, Character AI, Essential AI and Mistral AI are building and serving models on it.
For developers building GenAI applications, we offer Vertex AI, a comprehensive enterprise AI platform. It helps customers like Deutsche Telekom and Moody's discover, customize, augment and deploy over 130 GenAI models, including PaLM, MedPaLM, SetPalM and Gemini as well as popular open-source and partner models. Vertex AI has seen strong adoption with the API request increasing nearly 6x from H1 to H2 last year.
Using Vertex AI, Samsung recently announced its Galaxy S24 Series smartphone with Gemini and [ Imagine2 ], our advanced text-to-image model. Shutterstock has added Imagine2 to their AI image generator, enabling users to turn simple text prompts into unique visuals. And Victoria's Secret & Co. will look to personalize and improve the customer experience with Gemini, Vertex AI, Search and Conversations.
Customers are increasingly choosing Duet AI, our packaged AI agents for Google Workspace and Google Cloud Platform, to boost productivity and improve their operations. Since its launch, thousands of companies and more than 1 million trusted testers have used Duet AI. It will incorporate Gemini soon.
In Workspace, Duet AI is helping employees benefit from improved productivity and creativity at thousands of paying customers around the world, including Singapore Post, Uber and Woolworths. In Google Cloud Platform, Duet AI assists software developers and cybersecurity analysts. Duet AI for developers is the only GenAI offering to support the complete development and operations life cycle fine-tuned with the customer's own core corpus and policies. It's helping Wayfair, GE Appliances and Commerzbank write better software, faster with AI code completion, cogeneration and chat support. With Duet AI and security operations, we are helping cybersecurity teams at Fiserv, Spotify and Pfizer.
Our robust growth has been driven by strong direct and indirect channels. With ISVs, we have nearly tripled the number of co-sell deals from 2022 to 2023. In our ecosystem, there are nearly 90,000 Google Cloud GenAI-enabled consultants. And Accenture has teamed up with Google Cloud to create a joint generative AI center of excellence.
Next, let me turn to our focus and discipline as we pursue the opportunities ahead. Search, YouTube and Cloud are supported by our state-of-the-art compute infrastructure. This infrastructure is also key to realizing our big AI ambitions. It's a major differentiator for us. We continue to invest responsibly in our data centers and compute to support this new wave of growth in AI-powered services for us and for our customers. Through this, we are being disciplined in how we run the company.
You've heard me talk about our efforts to durably reengineer our cost base and to improve our velocity and efficiency. That work continues. Teams are working to focus on key priorities and execute fast, removing layers and simplifying their organizational structures.
As just one example, our devices team has brought together different teams from across Nest, Fitbit and other teams into a new functional structure. This will help us pull resources and drive progress across our Pixel portfolio. Across different teams, we have wound down some nonpriority projects, which will help us invest and operate well in our growth areas.
We are also improving our machine utilization, building on our years of experience in driving cost efficiencies in our computing infrastructure and operations. And through our supplier efficiency efforts and automation of certain processes, we have made major improvements in areas like procurement, achieving significant savings.
That's a snapshot of the quarter. Before I close, a couple of other highlights. Pixel 8, our AI-first phone, was awarded Phone of the Year by numerous outlets. It now uses Gemini Nano with features like Magic Compose for Google Messages and more to come.
In our Other Bets portfolio of companies, Waymo, which is deeply focused on safety, reached over 1 million fully autonomous ride-hailing trips. And Isomorphic Labs entered into strategic partnerships with Eli Lilly and Novartis to apply AI to treat diseases, which has great potential.
2023 was a year of profound innovation and product momentum. Thank you to our many partners. We succeed when our partners do, and we are grateful for the work we do together, from our partners across the Android ecosystem who are on display at CES to our deep relationships with retailers, small businesses and advertising partners, to the next generation of AI start-ups and developers and many more. I also want to thank all of our employees for their hard work throughout 2023 and the start of the new year. I'm excited for what's ahead in 2024. Philipp? Thanks, Sundar, and hi, everyone. Google Services revenues of $76 billion were up 12% year-on-year. In Google advertising, Search and other revenues grew 13% year-on-year, led again by solid growth in the retail vertical. We had particular strength in retail in APAC, a trend that began in the second quarter of 2023 and continued through the end of the year.
YouTube ads revenue were up 16% year-on-year driven by growth in both direct response and brand. And network revenues declined 2% year-on-year. In Subscriptions, Platforms and Devices, which was previously named Google Other, year-on-year revenues increased 23% driven by strong growth in subscriptions.
Now for some color on the quarter and where we see continued upside for long-term advertising growth. Over the last few calls, I have consistently highlighted how we're putting Google AI to work for our customers to deliver profitability and help them achieve their goals in a do-more-with-less environment.
From a product perspective, in Q4, Performance Max remained a bright spot. We're also excited about demand gen momentum. This is our big bet to help social advertisers find and convert consumers via immersive, relevant visual creatives across YouTube, including YouTube Shorts, Gmail and Discover. In a single campaign, you get access to over 3 billion users as they stream, scroll, connect and decide what to buy. Tens of thousands of advertisers are testing and on average seeing 6% more conversions per dollar versus image-only ads and discovery campaigns.
As we look ahead, we're also starting to put generative AI in the hands of more and more businesses to help them build better campaigns and even better performing ads. Automatically created assets help advertisers show more relevant search ads by creating tailored headlines and descriptions based on each ads context. Adoption was up with strong feedback in Q4. In addition to now being available in 8 languages, more advanced GenAI-powered capabilities are coming to ACA.
And then last week's big news was that Gemini will power new conversational experience in Google Ads. This is open beta to U.S. and U.K. advertisers. Early tests show advertisers are building higher-quality search campaigns with less effort, especially SMBs who are 42% more likely to publish a campaign with good or excellent ad strength. We can't wait to see how this continues to drive performance and level the playing field for advertisers of all sizes.
As we shared last quarter, Ads will continue to play an important role in the new search experience, and we'll continue to experiment with new formats native to SGE. SGE is creating new opportunities for us to improve commercial journeys for people by showing relevant ads alongside Search results. We've also found that people are finding ads either above or below the AI-powered overview helpful as they provide useful options for people to take action and connect with businesses.
Looking at our strong Search performance for the fourth quarter. Retail was a highlight. We continue to see a stronger start to the season up to and including Cyber Five. In Q3, we indicated that we were seeing early trends of consumers being very price-conscious, and we saw this play out in Q4. With promotional demand at an all-time high, deal seekers using Google had access to 2x the deals in the U.S. versus last season as well as a better shopping experience. Launches included a one-stop shop deals destination, new filters like GetItFast and AI-generated gifting recommendations in SGE. These new features drove incremental quarry growth during key shopping moments like Cyber Five.
Our proven AI-powered ad solutions were also a win for retailers looking to accelerate omni growth and capture holiday demand. Quick examples include a large U.S. big-box retailer who drove a 60%-plus increase in omni ROAS and a 22%-plus increase in store traffic using Performance Max during Cyber Five; and a well-known global fashion brand, who drove a 15%-plus higher omnichannel conversion rate versus regular shopping traffic by showcasing its store pickup offering across top markets through pickup later on shopping ads.
Moving on to YouTube. We're obviously pleased with YouTube's advertising revenue growth in Q4 and also significant growth in our subscription revenue. I'll reiterate what I have said before: YouTube success starts with creator success. We give millions of creators more ways to create content and connect with fans and more ways to make money and build their own businesses than any other platform. More creators means more content, which leads to more viewers. And via ads and subscriptions, these viewers fund our creators and drive the eyeballs and engagement our advertisers want.
To keep this momentum going, we're focused on delivering value across 4 pillars: creation, viewers, monetization and responsibility. First, creation, which increasingly takes place on mobile devices. We've invested in a full suite of tools, including our new YouTube Create app for Shorts, to help people make everything from 15-second Shorts to 15-minute videos to 15-hour live streams with a production studio in the palm of their hands.
GenAI is supercharging these capabilities. Anyone with a phone can swap in a new backdrop, remove background extras, translate their video into dozens of languages, all without a big studio budget. We're excited about our first products in this area from Dream Screen for AI-generated backgrounds to allowed for AI-powered dubbing. There is more to come.
Number two, viewers. We continue to grow watch time across YouTube with strong growth in Shorts and Connected TV. Shorts remains a top priority. We have 2 billion-plus logged-in users every month, and we are averaging 70 billion in daily views. Connected TVs or what we refer to as the living room is where viewership is growing the fastest. We're investing to make this experience even better with interactive features tailored to TVs, plus the content people love: our creators, NFL Sunday Ticket and the range of live sports and studio content via YouTube TV and Primetime Channels. Put this all together, and YouTube is the must-have app on every Connected TV.
Monetization is pillar #3 and realized through a combination of ad-supported and subscription offerings. Advertising generates the bulk of our revenue, and we continue to invest heavily here. We've rolled out CTV-first formats like 30-second nonskippable ads and pause experiences as well as an industry-first send-to-phone experience that lets people use a second screen to engage with ads.
For Shorts, we've developed new formats that are less interruptive to viewers. It's early. We're learning but excited by the opportunities for ads this can unlock. Shorts monetization continues to progress nicely.
Our AI part video for from video reach and video view campaigns to demand gen and video action continue to make advertiser dollars go further and drive results across the funnel. We're also introducing new and existing advertisers to YouTube via sports content. 90-plus upfront and scatter advertisers, including Unilever, are partnering with YouTube in our first year across NFL Sunday Ticket in-game advertising opportunities.
Our subscription offerings are also growing at a healthy clip. YouTube Music and Premium performed well. Premium users are delivering more value to our partners and YouTube than even ad-supported users do. On average, each additional Premium sign-up boost earnings for creators, music and media partners and YouTube itself. And we've made Premium even more attractive with new features, bundles and other enhancements.
We're also pleased with our first season of NFL Sunday Ticket. It gave creators new opportunities to create content and feed user engagement across traditional user content and professional sports content. Feedback on the user experience, including MultiView, has been great. We're excited to continue to innovate here.
Responsibility is our fourth pillar, and it underlines everything we do across YouTube. We continue to focus relentlessly on this. As always, deepening our relationships with key partners to bring them the best of Google is a key priority for us, and we continue to do this across industries in Q4.
We just talked about the NFL. Sundar mentioned Samsung, among others earlier. Another highlight was our expanded partnership with Porsche to enhance customers' digital experiences with a deeper in-vehicle integration of Google built-in services, including Google Maps and Play.
Whether it's continued collaboration with our partners and key ecosystems, we're putting Google AI to work for more customers. I'm excited about the opportunities for continued impact in 2024.
I'll wrap with a huge note of gratitude to our customers and partners. Our success is only possible because of their success and then to our Googlers for their outstanding work and focus this year.
Ruth, over to you. Thank you, Philipp. We are very pleased with our full year results with 2023 Alphabet revenues of $307 billion, up 9% versus 2022, which added $25 billion to revenues for the year. We ended with a strong fourth quarter with consolidated revenues of $86.3 billion, up 13% versus last year in both reported and constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the fourth quarter, unless I state otherwise.
Total cost of revenues was $37.6 billion, up 6%. Other cost of revenues was $23.6 billion, up 5%, with the increase driven primarily by content acquisition costs associated with YouTube subscription offerings. The growth rate also reflects the offsetting benefit of lapping $1.2 billion in inventory-related charges that we called out in the fourth quarter last year as well as a reduction in depreciation expense due to changes in estimated useful lives we made starting in the first quarter of 2023.
In terms of total expenses, the year-on-year comparisons reflect an additional $1.2 billion in exit charges that we took in the fourth quarter of 2023 in connection with actions to optimize our global office space. As you can see in our earnings release, these charges were allocated across the expense lines in other cost of revenues and OpEx based on associated head count.
Operating expenses were $25 billion, up 11%, primarily reflecting an increase in R&D expenses, which were driven by the real estate charges, followed by compensation. Operating income was $23.7 billion, up 30%, and our operating margin was 27%. Net income was $20.7 billion, and EPS was $1.64. We delivered free cash flow of $7.9 billion, which was affected by the timing of the $10.5 billion tax payment we made on October 16 that we called out previously related to the deferral of certain tax payments to the fourth quarter.
For the full year 2023, free cash flow was $69 billion. We repurchased a total of $62 billion of our Class A and Class C shares in 2023 and ended the year with $111 billion in cash and marketable securities.
Turning to segment results. Within Google Services, revenues were $76.3 billion, up 12%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $48 billion in the quarter were up 13%, led again by growth in retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $9.2 billion were up 16% driven by both direct response and brand advertising. Network advertising revenues of $8.3 billion were down 2%.
Subscriptions, Platforms and Devices revenues, which we previously referred to as other revenues, were $10.8 billion, up 23%, primarily reflecting growth in YouTube subscription revenues. TAC was $14 billion, up 8%. Google Services operating income was $26.7 billion, up 32%, and the operating margin was 35%.
Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $9.2 billion for the quarter, up 26%. We're very pleased with the momentum of GCP with an increasing contribution from AI. Google Workspace also delivered strong revenue growth primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat. Google Cloud delivered operating income of $864 million and an operating margin of 9%.
As to our Other Bets for the full year 2023, revenues were $1.5 billion, and the operating loss was $4.1 billion. Results in the fourth quarter benefited from a milestone payment in one of the Other Bets.
Turning to our outlook for the business. With respect to Google Services, first, within advertising. We were pleased with the sequential revenue growth of Search and YouTube advertising throughout 2023, which reflects the extraordinary work across our teams to drive improved experiences for users and attractive ROI for advertisers. As we enter 2024 with advertising revenues of more than $100 billion higher than 2019, we remain focused on sustaining healthy growth on this larger base.
Second, within Subscriptions, Platforms and Devices, our total revenues from subscription products reached $15 billion for the full year 2023 driven primarily by substantial growth in subscribers for our YouTube subscription offerings. The substantial increase in our subscription revenues over the past few years demonstrates the ability of our teams to deliver high value-add offerings and provides a strong base on which to build, including through YouTube and newer services like Google One.
Play had solid growth again in the fourth quarter driven primarily by an increase in the number of buyers. In devices, we continue to make sizable investments with increased emphasis on our Pixel family, particularly with AI-powered innovation while driving further efficiencies across the portfolio.
Turning to Google Cloud. We are pleased with operating performance in the year. Full year revenues of $33 billion were up 26% versus prior year, ending with strong Q4 performance. The Cloud team is intensely focused on bringing the benefits of Gemini, our industry-leading AI technology, to enterprises and governments globally, and we are gratified with the level of engagement. The strong demand we are seeing for our vertically integrated AI portfolio is creating new opportunities for Google Cloud across every product area.
In terms of profitability, the improvement in 2023 reflects sustained focus across the team with the intent to maintain healthy profitability while we continue to invest to support long-term growth.
Turning to margins and expenses. As we have repeatedly stressed, we remain committed to our framework to durably reengineer our cost base as we invest to support our growth priorities. Key contributors to moderating our expense growth include: first, product and process prioritization to ensure we have the right resources behind our most important opportunities and to reallocate resources where we can; second, organizational efficiency and structure. We're focused on removing layers to simplify execution and drive velocity.
Both product prioritization and the organization design efforts result in a slower pace of hiring, as you can see with our head count down year-on-year, reflecting the reductions we announced in the first quarter of 2023 and a much slower pace of hiring. We will continue to invest in top technical and engineering talent.
Finally, we continue to execute the other work streams to slow expense growth, including improving efficiency in our technical infrastructure, streamlining operations across Alphabet through the use of AI, increasing efficiency of our spend with suppliers and vendors through our central procurement organization, and optimizing our real estate portfolio.
With respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the fourth quarter was $11 billion driven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure with the largest component for servers followed by data centers. The step-up in CapEx in Q4 reflects our outlook for the extraordinary applications of AI to deliver for users, advertisers, developers, cloud enterprise customers and governments globally and the long-term growth opportunities that offers. In 2024, we expect investment in CapEx will be notably larger than in 2023.
With regard to Other Bets, we've been working to sharpen our investment focus while capturing the upside given compelling technology breakthroughs across the portfolio. For example, last week, Alphabet's X announced that it would be moving to spin out more projects as independent companies through external capital, giving X the opportunity to bring more focus to the breakthrough technologies it is working on to address some of the world's most pressing challenges.
Thank you. Sundar, Philipp and I will now take your questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. I have 2 for Philipp. Philipp, the first one is about sort of a lot of the new generative AI advertising tools. You obviously have a lot of irons in the fire here. You've been talking about some of the early momentum with tens of thousands of advertisers.
The question is, can you sort of walk us through some of the hurdles and gating factors that we should be thinking through that dictate the pace at which these tools can really be rolled out broadly just so we and advertisers can kind of get an understanding for when they could have a bigger impact on the whole business? And then secondly, how do you think about the long-term sales force intensity of the advertising business as you roll more AI-based tools like PMax impacting the overall ad allocation? Yes. Thank you so much. So I've covered this a little bit on previous quarters. AI has been at the core of our advertising products for a very, very long time. And the recent advances are really allowing us to drive more value for advertisers across a large range of different areas: bidding, targeting creative as well as our core advertiser and publisher experiences.
We are seeing in core search ads, for example, the bidding side, the value-based bidding as a very significant one on the targeting side, the broad match on creative, responsive search ads automatically created ads assets. And we are very happy with the progress we're seeing in those areas.
I think I mentioned in one of the previous calls that one. You asked about hurdles and gating factors. The AI essentials play neutral in this trying to get everybody ready to really take full advantage of those tools. We talked about the progress on PMax as well that we're very happy with in Q4. So overall, I think we are on track with what we're expecting here.
On the sales force intensity side, we have done a few reallocations or let me call it portfolio adjustments. As you know, we have 2 large different teams. One is our LCS, large customer solutions, team that's really focused on transformational growth for our largest and most sophisticated customers. And we have our -- we call them GCS, Global Customer Solutions, team which is the channel where really every customer starts from some of our largest customers now to also the millions of smaller ones and SMBs.
The GCS is really then scaling growth by dynamically delivering really the right treatment for every customer. And important to note, it's also our fastest-growing channel, and it delivered particularly strong growth in Q4. So we have done adjustments here to focus more resources on the GCS side.
But I also want to be clear, when we restructure, there's always an opportunity to be more efficient and smarter in how we service and grow our customers. We're not restructuring because AI is taking away roles that's important here. But we see significant opportunities here with our AI-powered solution to actually deliver incredible ROI at scale, and that's why we're doing some of those adjustments. So I look at sales force intensity as a stronger focus going forward on the channels I mentioned here. Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. One for Ruth and one for Philipp. Ruth, you're now into year 2 of durably reengineering your cost structure. Can you just help us assess your progress so far? And are there any guideposts that we should be thinking about going forward?
And then, Philipp, can you talk more about NFL Sunday Ticket and just what your key learnings were in year 1? How are you thinking about the returns on the investment on both from an advertising perspective and then also subscribers to both Sunday Ticket and YouTube TV? Thanks for the question. So we are very pleased with the progress we're continuing to make, and we are very committed to the framework to durably reengineer our cost base really as we're investing to support the growth priorities. I tried to call out a number of them in opening comments, but really, as you're looking at the work being done across Google, across Alphabet, it does start with product and process prioritization to make sure we've got the right resources behind the most important opportunities, and then that creates the opportunity for reallocating resources where we can.
Then we talked a lot about this quarter about organizational efficiency and structure, and we're focused on removing layers to simplify execution and drive velocity. The combination of those 2, product prioritization and organizational design work, has resulted in the slower pace of hiring. You can see that in our head count numbers down year-on-year. You can see it in some of the -- in the results that we delivered in the fourth quarter.
You can -- it also goes to the announcements around first quarter and much lower pace of hiring. At this point in the quarter, we do estimate that severance-related expense will be roughly $700 million in the first quarter as we've continued these efforts. But as I said in opening comments, we will continue to invest in top engineering.
So that's sort of the big one, if you start with product prioritization and organizational design, which is why also the note about the severance-related expense, which helps pave the way as we're continuing to do the work that we're doing. But then we have a host of other work streams, which I talked about, everything with improving efficiency in our technical infrastructure, which is a very large ongoing effort; streamlining operations across Alphabet through use of AI; all the work we're doing with our suppliers and vendors; the work we're doing optimizing our real estate portfolio. So when we've described durably reengineering, it's about continuing to build on work that started, and that is ongoing. So on the NFL Sunday Ticket side, look, as I said earlier, NFL Sunday Ticket supports our long-term strategy and really help solidify YouTube's position as a must-have app on everyone's TV set.
You asked about some of the learnings. Maybe I start with a viewing experience. We've received great feedback so far. People like the navigation, MultiView, the chat, the lack of latency, a really, really positive feedback on this one. You asked about the ads and the subs. Maybe I start with the subscribers.
We're pleased with the NFL Sunday Ticket sign-ups and all for a season both as part of the YouTube TV bundle and as a stand-alone offering on YouTube Primetime Channels. Remember, you can access them via both. Nothing more to share on the sub side today on this one.
On the ad side, as you know, advertisers can buy from an NFL lineup as part of our YouTube Select portfolio. And this actually allows advertisers to reach football fans across YouTube's pretty unique breadth of NFL content independently of whether you're doing live game on YouTube TV or Primetime Channels or watching NFL Highlights, post game commentary on YouTube channels.
And we saw solid demand across the ad market around our YouTube Sunday Ticket offering here. We're excited about the partnership ahead or the partnerships ahead. This is our first season. And I mentioned over [ 90 ] scatter advertisers partnered with YouTube in our first year across NFL Sunday Ticket in-game opportunities, which we really appreciate. Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Two, if I could. Sundar, a bigger-picture question, coming back to your comments earlier in the call on Search Generative Experience. When you think about the evolution of product over the next couple of years, how do you envision more traditional search things like the Google Assistant continuing to evolve in a world of Search Generative Experience and Bard and what that might mean for elements of commercial and noncommercial search and how use cases might change in the years ahead?
And then, Ruth, I just want to make sure we understood some of the messaging from the release and the public comments around one-timers in the quarter itself. It seems as if they were not allocated to the segments but are more elements of Other Bets Alphabet-level activities. I just want to confirm whether those one-timers were captured in the P&L statement and whether there were also any elements of legal one-timers that would be called out this quarter as well. Thanks, Eric. Great question. Look, it is an exciting time. Clearly, as I said, as we are incorporating SGE in the product, the early feedback is positive. And we've been iterating on it, and it clearly works for certain type of queries very well. We are expanding the set of queries where it works very well. It definitely is answering a certain category of queries for the first time in a better way. So that gives us direction to proceed as well.
Overall, one of the things I think people underestimate about Search is the breadth of Search, the amount of queries we see constantly on a new day, which we haven't seen before. And so the trick here is to deliver that high-quality experience across the breadth of what we see in search.
And over time, we think Assistant will be very complementary. And we will again use generative AI there, particularly with our most advanced models and Bard and allows us to act more like an agent over time, if I were to think about the future and maybe go beyond answers and follow through for users even more. So that is the -- directionally, what the opportunity set is. Obviously, a lot of execution ahead. But it's an area where I think we have a deep sense of what to do. And all the work we have taken so far, the feedback has been super positive. And then in terms of your other question, so on the real estate charge of $1.2 billion in exit charges related to real estate, that is in Alphabet-level activities. But the other comment I was making in opening comments is when you go through the various line items, R&D, et cetera, you see it spread there. And we have a table and IR can walk anybody through the technicals on that just to understand how it then gets arrayed across the various lines in the P&L. Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. I have 2 for Philipp, I think. Given the importance of Connected TV engagement YouTube, can you talk about the opportunity outside the U.S. for Connected TV? And what the company is doing at large to drive more adoption of YouTube or Connected TVs given the Google operating system? Anything you talk about outside the U.S.?
And then you've been consistent about the strength of Shorts over the past year. Can you talk a bit about the modernization challenges? Do you still see the headwinds that you saw at the beginning? Anything you could share about the density of the auction or advertising interest on Shorts to help us with whether or not that's still a headwind to growth? Yes. Thank you so much for your question. On the Connected TV side, I mentioned it actually continues to perform really well. I said before, YouTube is the leader in U.S. streaming watch time and just one audience group diving deep. It's really all audiences. On the international side, it's something we are closely looking at. There's nothing specific I have to -- at this moment in time on this one.
On the Shorts monetization side, look, we built Shorts to respond to the huge demand from both creators and viewers for short-form video. And we're very pleased with the growth we've seen. I mentioned 2 billion-plus users every month, 70 billion in daily views. Specifically to the monetization question, Shorts monetization continues to progress nicely. In fact, actually, since we introduced revenue sharing for Shorts, the total creator earnings generated from Shorts have increased every month, and we expect this to continue. And similar, obviously, to our long-form videos, we're really committed here to a long-term partnership. And you heard me say this before, right, when creators succeed, we succeed. Our next question comes from Stephen Ju with UBS. So Philipp, this is not a new question, but it's also been about 2 years since PMax was launched. But it seems like there's been this long lineage of product development and rollout of things like smart bidding in your history, which I believe at the time was designed to help smaller advertisers more easily run search advertising.
And today, you're helping need to generate creative as well as manage my spend and maximize ROI across multiple Google Services. So how are you feeling about enabling SMBs who otherwise could not advertise with you before? And what kind of TAM expansion tailwind does that create for your revenue growth over the longer term? Look, as you know, SMBs are a huge focus for us. We mentioned this several times before. They're part of our GCS channel, not only there's more in this. But they've been under a ton of change over the last few years. And our focus has always been here on investing in solutions that really help level the playing field, and you mentioned several of those. So actually, SMBs can compete with bigger brands and more sophisticated advertisers.
And so feedback we're always getting is they need easy solutions that could drive value quickly, and several of the AI part solutions that you're mentioning are actually making the workflow and the whole on-ramp and the bidded targeting creative and so on you mentioned that is so much easier for SMBs. So we're very satisfied with what we're seeing here. We will continue to invest. And I feel AI is really a helpful, very interesting future path to make life not only easier but also much more productive and better arise over time, more level playing field for SMBs. Our next question comes from Justin Post with BAML. Maybe one for Sundar and one for Ruth. Just on Search growth, I think there are some concerns on use of competitive AI tools as an alternative to Search. Just wondering if you see any changes in query volumes, positive or negative, since you've seen the year evolve and more Search innovative experiences. And what can really make Google stand out versus other AI tools?
And then Ruth, CapEx was $11 billion. A step-up, obviously. Any onetime items in there? Or is that how we should think about the new run rate into '24. Thanks, Justin. First of all, look, we think about effects on Search, obviously, more broadly. People have a lot of information choices. So -- and user expectations are constantly evolving. And so we've been doing this for a long time. And I think what ends up mattering is a strong continuous track record of innovation.
Obviously, generative AI is a new tool in the arsenal. But there's a lot more that goes into Search: the breadth, the depth the diversity across verticals, stability to follow through getting actually access to rich, diverse sources of content on the web and putting it all together in a compelling way.
And I think, through the year 2, when we test, we test Search Generative Experience, particularly against everything that's out there. And we can see the progress we are making and how much users are liking the experience better. And so I think I feel very good about the progress. And our road map for '24 is strong both on the Search and the underlying AI progress, including the model. So I'm pretty excited about what's ahead of us in '24. And with respect to CapEx -- the CapEx of $11 billion in the fourth quarter, as I indicated, was overwhelmingly investment in our technical infrastructure. To your question, there was no onetime item in there. It really reflects is our outlook for everything Sundar and Philipp and I have been talking about, the extraordinary applications of AI within Google DeepMind, Google Services, Google Cloud, it's across the board for users, for advertisers, developers, cloud enterprise customers, governments. And it's really the long-term opportunity that offer.
So last quarter, we did note that CapEx would continue to grow in 2024. We do expect 2024 full year CapEx to be notably larger than 2023. As a note, I think you all know this, but timing of cash payments can affect the quarterly CapEx number. But the main point is we're continuing to invest. Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. So I guess a question for, I don't know if Sundar or Philipp. But if we go back to the DOJ trial that happened in the fall, there was a document that was disclosed from Google that said something along the lines of why being on ad quality team to deliver 20% RPM growth in Search is a fragile strategy. Digging back to 2019, your business has, I think, more than doubled since then.
So I guess, as we sit here today in early 2024, how do you feel about Google's ability to drive Search RPM going forward? And I guess in the context of what Ruth said tonight about the large revenue base, just how do you feel about the monetization? Look, I think I have tremendous confidence in the quality driven both our work, be it search quality, ads quality, our improvements on search, our improvements on ads RPM, all -- 2 foundational pillars are extraordinary focus on ads quality so that we deliver the actual ROI to advertisers and improve the experience for users and all underpinned by rigor and technical excellence and go-to-market excellence, right?
So the fundamental attributes don't change. I think AI gives us opportunity both on the organic side as well as on the monetization side. And I think we are in the early days of it. I think we'll be able to, taking a long-term view, serve information needs in a deeper way. And so I think about it in that -- with that long-term context, and I'm pretty excited about what's ahead. And our last question will be from Mark Mahaney with Evercore. One question on YouTube AI and one on cloud. On cloud first, there's just this volatility, this material deceleration last quarter and the nice reacceleration this quarter. Is that explained by where we are in the optimization cycle, and it may be generative AI workloads starting to trickle in now and cause that growth curve to bend back up? Any commentary just on the sort of the volatility, the deceleration and the reacceleration that we've seen?
And then, Philipp, I wanted to ask on on the creative side, and particularly on YouTube and ads and the creative, using AI to improve the creative and really to offer SMBs who have been with Google forever but offer them now performance-based video ad campaigns created by AI. Is that kind of a new growth area? How far along are you in terms of offering this out into the market? And do you think that this opens up a new area of spend that wasn't there before? Thanks, Mark. On cloud, let me take that. First of all, a combination of factors. I think definitely excitement around the AI solutions on top of our foundational pillar with data and analytics, infrastructure, security, et cetera. But AI is definitely something which is driving interest and early adoption. And as you saw, that greater than 70% of GenAI unions are using Google Cloud. And so I think it's an area where our strengths will continue to play out as we go through '24, especially when I look at innovation ahead from us on the AI front. And second, I think there are regional variations, but the cost optimizations in many parts are something we have mostly worked through. And I think that was a contributing factor as well. So on your YouTube question, maybe let me start with a general view. YouTube submission, you know, has enabled millions of creators around the world to share their voice and connect with audiences and obviously build thriving businesses here. And AI has been a very critical piece of this already.
You are obviously aware of the made YouTube announcement where we introduced a whole lot of new complementary creativity features on YouTube, including Dream Screen, for example, and a lot of other really interesting tools and thoughts. You can obviously imagine that we can take this more actively to the advertising world already. As you know, it continues already to power AI, a lot of our video ad solutions and measurement capabilities. It's part of video rich campaigns. Multi-format ads are -- actually, there is a generative creator music that actually makes it easier for creators to design the perfect soundtrack already.
And as I said earlier, AI will unlock a new world of creativity. And you can see how this will -- if you just look at where models are heading, where multimodal models are heading, where the generation capabilities of those models are heading, you can absolutely see how this will impact and -- positively impact and simplify the flow for creators, similar to what you see already emerging in some of our core products like ACA on the Search side. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any further remarks. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter 2024 call. Thank you and have a good evening. Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler, and Ruth Porat.
Now I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations, and financial performance may be considered forward-looking. Such statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. Please refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q, including the risk factors. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.
During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. Our comments will be on year-over-year comparisons unless we state otherwise.
And now I'll turn the call over to Sundar. Thank you, Jim, and hello, everyone. It was a great quarter led by strong performance from Search, YouTube, and Cloud.
Today, I want to share how we are thinking about the business and the opportunity more broadly. Of course, that's heavily focused on AI and Search. Then I'll take you through some highlights from the quarter in Cloud, YouTube and beyond.
Let's discuss our momentum and strategy. Taking a step back, it took Google more than 15 years to reach $100 billion in annual revenue. In just the last 6 years, we have gone from $100 billion to more than $300 billion in annual revenue. Of course, Search continues to power that as you see in our Q1 results. But in addition, we expect YouTube overall and Cloud to exit 2024 at a combined annual run rate of over $100 billion. This shows our track record of investing in and building successful new growing businesses.
Now let's look at how well we are positioned for the next wave of AI innovation and the opportunity ahead. There are 6 points to make: one, research leadership; two, infrastructure leadership; three, innovation in Search; four, our global product footprint; five, velocity in execution; six, monetization paths.
First, our foundation of research leadership. We've been an AI-first company since 2016, pioneering many of the modern breakthroughs that power AI progress for us and for the industry. Last week, we further consolidated teams that build AI models under Google DeepMind. This will help simplify development and establish a single access point for our product teams as they build generative AI applications with these models. The teams are making rapid progress, developing Gemini and other models.
In February, we rolled out Gemini 1.5 Pro, which shows dramatic performance enhancements across a number of dimensions. It includes a breakthrough in long context understanding, achieving the longest context window of any large-scale foundation model yet. Combining this with Gemini's native multimodal understanding across audio, video, text code and more, it's highly capable. We are already seeing developers and enterprise customers enthusiastically embrace Gemini 1.5 and use it for a wide range of things. Beyond Gemini, we have built other useful models, including our Gemma open models as well as image and visual models and others.
Second, infrastructure leadership. We have the best infrastructure for the AI era. Building world-leading infrastructure is in our DNA, starting in our earliest days when we had to design purpose-built hardware to power Search. Our data centers are some of the most high-performing, secure, reliable, and efficient in the world. They've been purpose-built for training cutting-edge AI models and designed to achieve unprecedented improvements in efficiency. We have developed new AI models and algorithms that are more than 100x more efficient than they were 18 months ago.
Our custom TPUs, now in their fifth generation, are powering the next generation of ambitious AI projects. Gemini was trained on and is served using TPUs. We are committed to making the investments required to keep us at the leading edge in technical infrastructure. You can see that from the increases in our capital expenditures. This will fuel growth in Cloud, help us push the frontiers of AI models and enable innovation across our services, especially in Search.
AI innovations in Search are the third and perhaps the most important point I want to make. We have been through technology shifts before, to the web, to mobile, and even to voice technology. Each shift expanded what people can do with Search and led to new growth. We are seeing a similar shift happening now with generative AI. For nearly a year, we've been experimenting with SGE in search labs across a wide range of queries. And now we are starting to bring AI overviews to the main Search results page. We are being measured in how we do this, focusing on areas where gen AI can improve the search experience while also prioritizing traffic to websites and merchants.
We have already served billions of queries with our generative AI features. It's enabling people to access new information, to ask questions in new ways and to ask more complex questions. Most notably, based on our testing, we are encouraged that we are seeing an increase in search usage among people who use the new AI overviews as well as increased user satisfaction with the results. And with Circle to Search, people can now circle what they see on their Android screens, ask a question about an image or object in a video and get an AI overview with Lens.
Fourth, our global product footprint beyond Search. We have 6 products with more than 2 billion monthly users, including 3 billion Android devices. 15 products have 0.5 billion users, and we operate across 100-plus countries. This gives us a lot of opportunities to bring helpful gen AI features and multimodal capabilities to people everywhere and improve their experiences. We have brought many new AI features to Pixel, Photos, Chrome, Messages and more. We are also pleased with the progress we are seeing with Gemini and Gemini Advanced through the Gemini app on Android and the Google app on iOS.
Fifth, improved velocity in execution. We've been really focused on simplifying our structures to help us move faster. In addition to bringing together our model-building teams under Google DeepMind, we recently unified our ML infrastructure and ML developer teams to enable faster decisions, smarter compute allocation, and a better customer experience.
Earlier this year, we brought our Search teams together under one leader. And last week, we took another step, bringing together our platforms and devices teams. The new combined team will focus on delivering high-quality products and experiences, bolstering the Android and Chrome ecosystems, and bringing our best innovations to partners faster.
We also remain focused on long-term efforts to durably reengineer our cost base. You can see the impact of this work reflected in our operating margin improvement. We continue to manage our head count growth and align teams with our highest priority areas. This speeds up decision-making, reduces layers, and enables us to invest in the right areas.
Beyond our teams, we are very focused on our cost structures, procurement and efficiency. And a number of technical breakthroughs are enhancing machine speed and efficiency, including the new family of Gemini models and a new generation of TPUs. For example, since introducing SGE about a year ago, machine costs associated with SGE responses have decreased 80% from when first introduced in Labs driven by hardware, engineering, and technical breakthroughs. We remain committed to all of this work.
Finally, our monetization path. We have clear paths to AI monetization through Ads and Cloud as well as subscriptions. Philipp will talk more about new AI features that are helping advertisers, including bringing Gemini models into Performance Max. Our Cloud business continues to grow as we bring the best of Google AI to enterprise customers and organizations around the world. And Google One now has crossed 100 million paid subscribers, and in Q1, we introduced a new AI premium plan with Gemini Advanced.
Okay, those are the 6 points so now let me turn to quarterly highlights from Cloud and YouTube in a bit more detail. In Cloud, we have announced more than 1,000 new products and features over the past 8 months. At Google Cloud Next, more than 300 customers and partners spoke about their generative AI successes with Google Cloud, including global brands like Bayer, Cintas, Mercedes-Benz, Walmart and many more.
Our differentiation in Cloud begins with our AI hypercomputer, which provides efficient and cost-effective infrastructure to train and serve models. Today, more than 60% of funded gen AI start-ups and nearly 90% of gen AI unicorns are Google Cloud customers. And customers like PayPal and Kakao Brain are choosing our infrastructure. We offer an industry-leading portfolio of NVIDIA GPUs along with our TPUs. This includes TPU v5p, which is now generally available and NVIDIA's latest generation of Blackwell GPUs. We also announced Axion, our new Google design and Arm-based CPU. In benchmark testing, it has performed up to 50% better than comparable x86-based systems.
On top of our infrastructure, we offer more than 130 models, including our own models, open source models and third-party models. We made Gemini 1.5 Pro available to customers as well as Imagine 2.0 at Cloud Next. And we shared that more than 1 million developers are now using our generative AI across tools, including AI Studio and Vertex AI. We spoke about how customers like Bristol-Myers Squibb and Etsy can quickly and easily build agents and connect them to their existing systems. For example, Discover Financial has begun deploying gen AI-driven tools to its nearly 10,000 call center agents to achieve faster resolution times for customers. Customers can also now ground their gen AI with Google Search and their own data from their enterprise databases and applications.
In Workspace, we announced that organizations like Uber, Pepperdine University and PennyMac are using Gemini and Google Workspace, our AI-powered agent that's built right into Gmail, Docs sheets and more. We also announced Google Vids, a new application to create stories in short video format. And we introduced Gemini for Meetings and Messaging and Gemini Security for Workspace.
Customers are choosing Workspace because they have deep trust in our powerful security and privacy features.
Our Cloud business is now widely seen as the leader in cybersecurity. I saw this firsthand when I went to the Munich Security Conference in February. Cybersecurity analysts are using Gemini to help spot threats, summarize intelligence and take action against attacks, helping companies like American Family Insurance aggregate and analyze security data in seconds instead of days.
Turning next to YouTube, which continues to grow and lead in streaming. We announced that on average, viewers are watching over 1 billion hours of YouTube content on TVs daily. AI experiments like Dream Screen will give anyone the ability to make AI-generated backgrounds for YouTube Shorts. And on subscriptions, which are increasingly important for YouTube, we announced that in Q1, YouTube surpassed 100 million Music and Premium subscribers globally, including trialers. And YouTube TV now has more than 8 million paid subscribers.
Finally, in Other Bets, Waymo's fully autonomous service continues to grow ridership in San Francisco and Phoenix with high customer satisfaction, and we started offering paid rides in Los Angeles and testing rider-only trips in Austin.
Overall, it was a great quarter, and there's more to come. IO is in less than 3 weeks, followed by Brandcast and Google Marketing Live.
I want to thank our employees around the world who are at the heart of this progress and who continue to focus on building innovative products, helpful services and new opportunities for businesses and partners around the world. Thank you. Philipp? Thanks, Sundar, and hi, everyone.
Google Services revenue of $70 billion were up 14% year-on-year. Search and other revenues grew 14% year-on-year led again by solid growth in the retail vertical with particular strength from APAC-based retailers, which began in the second quarter of 2023.
YouTube Ads revenues were up 21% year-on-year driven by growth in both direct response and brand. Network revenues declined 1% year-on-year. In subscriptions, platforms and devices, year-on-year revenues increased 18%, driven again by strong growth in YouTube subscriptions.
Let's now talk about a few highlights from the quarter from a product innovation and advertising performance perspective.
First, it bears repeating that AI innovation across our Ads ecosystem is core to every aspect of our product portfolio, from targeting, bidding, creative, measurement, and across campaign types. We've talked about whole solutions like Smart Bidding use AI to predict future ad conversions and their value in helping businesses stay agile and responsive to rapid shifts in demand and how products like broad match leverage LLMs to match ads to relevant searches and help advertisers respond to what millions of people are searching for. This is foundational.
As advances accelerate in our underlying AI models, our ability to help businesses find users at speed and scale and drive ROI just keeps getting better. We're especially excited about the doors gen AI is opening for creative capabilities, helping deliver on the premise of getting the right ad to the right user in the right moment.
Look at Performance Max. In February, we rolled Gemini into PMax. It's helping curate and generate text and image assets so businesses can meet PMax asset requirements instantly. This is available to all U.S. advertisers and starting to roll out internationally in English, and early results are encouraging. Advertisers using PMax asset generation are 63% more likely to publish a campaign with good or excellent ad strength. And those who improve their PMX ad strength to excellent see 6% more conversions on average.
We're also driving improved results for businesses opting into automatically created assets, which are supercharged with gen AI. Those adopting ACA see, on average, 5% more conversions at a similar cost per conversion in Search and Performance Max campaigns.
And then there's Dimension. Advertisers are loving its ability to engage new and existing customers and drive purchase consideration across our most immersive and visual touch points like YouTube, Shorts, Gmail and Discover.
Hollywood film and TV studio, Lionsgate, partnered with Horizon Media to test what campaign type will deliver the most ticketing page views for its The Hunger Games: Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes film. Over a 3-week test, demand gen was significantly more efficient versus social benchmarks with an 85% more efficient CPC and 96% more efficient cost per page view. Lionsgate has since rolled out demand gen for 2 new titles.
We're also bringing new creative features to demand gen. Earlier this month, we announced new generative image tools to help advertisers create high-quality assets in a few steps with a few simple prompts. This will be a win for up-leveling visual storytelling and testing creative concepts more efficiently.
And then there's obviously Search generative experience, which Sundar talked about. I laid out that innovation and the user experience on Search has historically opened up new opportunities for advertisers. We saw this when we successfully navigated from desktop to mobile. We're continuing to experiment with new ad formats, including search and shopping ads alongside search results in SGE. And we shared in March how folks are finding ads either above or below the SGE results helpful. We're excited to have a solid baseline to keep innovating on and confident in the role SGE, including Ads, will play in delighting users and expanding opportunities to meet user needs.
Which brings me to Search and our strong performance in the first quarter. In Q1, retail was again the top contributor. Our focus remains on driving profitability and growth for retailers, helping them optimize digital performance for both online and off-line as well as innovate across our shopping and merchant experiences.
Highlights include continued upsides for retailers, leading into agile budget and bidding strategies across Search, PMax, or both; take-home goods retailer IKEA, who leaned into Google's store sales measurement to understand its total omnichannel revenue opportunity across search. By measuring 2.3x more revenue and using value-based bidding solutions to bid to its omnichannel customers, IKEA drove a significant increase in omni revenue in Q1 and is now scaling this strategy globally. We also expanded local inventory ads into 23 countries, helping drive shopper confidence and off-line sales. Retailers can convert intent into action by showcasing in-store availability, pricing, pickup options and more all in one ad format.
Moving to YouTube. Last quarter, I went deep into our strategy. It all starts with creation, which drives viewership, which leads to monetization. A few updates to build on Sundar's remarks.
First, creation, which is all about giving creators the tools to create amazing content, grow their audiences and build their businesses. In 2023, more people created content on YouTube than ever before, and the number of channels uploading Shorts year-on-year grew 50%. We also hit a new milestone with 3 million-plus channels in our YouTube Partner Program. We recently shared that YPP has paid out more than any other creator monetization platform, including over $70 billion to creators, artists, and media companies over the last 3 years.
From a viewer's perspective, watch time across YouTube continues to grow, with strength in both Shorts and CTV. According to Nielsen, YouTube has been the leader in U.S. streaming watch time for the last 12-plus months. In the first quarter, Livingroom. benefited from a combination of strong watch time growth, innovation in the user and advertiser experience, and a shift in brand advertising budgets from linear TV to YouTube. Viewers are watching YouTube because they expect to access everything in one place across screens and formats, their favorite creators, live sports, breaking use, educational content, movies, music and more. And advertisers continue to lean in to find audiences they can't find elsewhere.
Which brings me to monetization. We're pleased with our Q1 performance across both our ad-supported and subscription offerings. Sundar covered subscription growth. On the Ads front, direct and brand were both strong this quarter. Shorts monetization continued to improve, with Shorts ads now supported on mobile, tablet, Livingroom. and desktop, and available to both performance and brand advertisers.
In the U.S., the monetization rate of Shorts relative to in-stream viewing has more than doubled in the past 12 months, including a 10-point sequential improvement in the first quarter alone. Just last week, we introduced new ways for brands to get the most out of their Shorts ads with new lineups on YouTube Select, including sports, beauty, fashion and lifestyle, and entertainment. For YouTube advertisers, increasing brand lift is one of the core goals. In Q1, we saw strong traction from the introduction of a pause ads pilot on connected TVs, a new non-interruptive ad format that appears when users pause their organic content. Initial results show that pause ads are driving strong brand lift results and are commanding premium pricing from advertisers.
Before I wrap, two quick highlights on how we're helping our partners transform and accelerate impact with the best across Google.
Number one, to help McDonald's build the restaurant of the future, we're deepening our partnership across cloud and ads. Part of this includes them connecting Google Cloud's latest hardware and data technologies across restaurants globally and starting to apply Gen AI to enhance its customer and employee experiences.
Number two, WPP. At Google Cloud Next, we announced a new collaboration that will redefine marketing through the integration of our Gemini models with WPP Open, WPP's AI-powered marketing operating system, already used by more than 35,000 of its people and adopted by key clients, including The Coca-Cola Company, L'Oreal and Nestle. We're just getting started here and excited about the innovation this partnership will unlock.
With that, a huge thank you to our customers and partners, many of whom we're excited to see at Google Marketing Live and Brandcast in just a few weeks. And a huge thank you, as always, to our incredible teams for their agility and hard work this quarter.
Ruth, you're up. Thank you, Philipp. We are very pleased with our financial results for the first quarter driven, in particular, by strength in Search and Cloud as well as the ongoing efforts to durably reengineer our cost base. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook.
For the first quarter, our consolidated revenues were $80.5 billion, up 15% or up 16% in constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth.
In terms of total expenses, the year-on-year comparisons reflect the impact of the restructuring charges we took in the first quarter of 2023 of $2.6 billion as well as the $716 million in employee severance and related charges in the first quarter of 2024. As you can see in our earnings release, these charges were allocated across the expense lines in other cost of revenues and OpEx based on associated head count.
To help with year-on-year comparisons, we included a table in our earnings release to adjust other cost of revenues, operating expenses, operating income, and operating margin to exclude the impact of severance and related office space charges in the first quarter of 2023 versus 2024.
In terms of expenses, total cost of revenues was $33.7 billion, up 10%. Other cost of revenues was $20.8 billion, up 10% on a reported basis, with the increase driven primarily by content acquisition costs associated with YouTube given the very strong revenue growth in both subscription offerings and ad-supported content. On an adjusted basis, other cost of revenues were up 13% year-on-year.
Operating expenses were $21.4 billion, down 2% on a reported basis, primarily reflecting expense decreases in sales and marketing and G&A, offset by an increase in R&D. The largest single factor in the year-on-year decline in G&A expenses was lower charges related to legal matters.
On an adjusted basis, operating expenses were up 5%, reflecting, first, in R&D, an increase in compensation expense, primarily for Google DeepMind and Cloud; and second, in sales and marketing, a slight increase year-on-year, reflecting increases in compensation expense primarily for Cloud sales.
Operating income was $25.5 billion, up 46% on a reported basis, and our operating margin was 32%. On an adjusted basis, operating income was up 31%, and our operating margin was 33%. Net income was $23.7 billion and EPS was $1.89. We delivered free cash flow of $16.8 billion in the first quarter and $69.1 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with $108 billion in cash and marketable securities.
Turning to segment results. Within Google Services, revenues were $70.4 billion, up 14%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $46.2 billion in the quarter were up 14% led again by growth in retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $8.1 billion were up 21% driven by both direct response and brand advertising. Network advertising revenues of $7.4 billion were down 1%. Subscriptions, platforms and devices revenues were $8.7 billion, up 18%, primarily reflecting growth in YouTube subscription revenues.
TAC was $12.9 billion, up 10%. Google Services operating income was $27.9 billion, up 28%. And the operating margin was 40%.
Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $9.6 billion for the quarter, up 28%, reflecting significant growth in GCP with an increasing contribution from AI and strong Google Workspace growth, primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat. Google Cloud delivered operating income of $900 million and an operating margin of 9%.
As to our Other Bets, for the first quarter, revenues were $495 million, benefiting from a milestone payment in one of the Other Bets. The operating loss was $1 billion.
Turning to our outlook for the business. With respect to Google Services, first, within Advertising, we are very pleased with the momentum of our Ads businesses. Search had broad-based strength across verticals. In YouTube, we had acceleration in revenue growth driven by brand and direct response.
Looking ahead, two points to call out: first, results in our advertising business in Q1 continued to reflect strength in spend from APAC-based retailers, a trend that began in the second quarter of 2023 and continued through Q1, which means we will begin lapping that impact in the second quarter; second, the YouTube acceleration in revenue growth in Q1 reflects, in part, lapping the negative year-on-year growth we experienced in the first quarter of 2023.
Turning to subscriptions, platforms, and devices. We continue to deliver significant growth in our subscriptions business, which drives the majority of revenue growth in this line. The sequential quarterly decline in year-on-year revenue growth for the line in Q1 versus Q4 reflects, in part, the fact that we had only 1 week of Sunday Ticket subscription revenue in Q1 versus 14 weeks in Q4. Looking forward, we will anniversary last year's price increase in YouTube TV starting in May.
With regard to platforms, we are pleased with the performance in Play driven by an increase in buyers.
With respect to Google Cloud, performance in Q1 reflects strong demand for our GCP infrastructure and solutions as well as the contribution from our Workspace productivity tools. The growth we are seeing across Cloud is underpinned by the benefit AI provides for our customers. We continue to invest aggressively while remaining focused on profitable growth.
As we look ahead, two points that will affect sequential year-on-year revenue growth comparisons across Alphabet: first, Q1 results reflect the benefit of leap year, which contributed slightly more than 1 point to our revenue growth rate at the consolidated level in the first quarter; second, at current spot rates, we expect a larger headwind from foreign exchange in Q2 versus Q1.
Turning to margins. Our efforts to durably reengineer our cost base are reflected in a 400 basis point expansion of our Alphabet operating margin year-on-year, excluding the impact of restructuring and severance charges in both periods. You can also see the impact in the quarter-on-quarter decline in head count in Q1, which reflects both actions we have taken over the past few months and a much slower pace of hiring. As we have discussed previously, we are continuing to invest in top engineering and technical talent, particularly in Cloud, Google DeepMind and technical infrastructure.
Looking ahead, we remain focused on our efforts to moderate the pace of expense growth in order to create capacity for the increases in depreciation and expenses associated with the higher levels of investment in our technical infrastructure. We believe these efforts will enable us to deliver full year 2024 Alphabet operating margin expansion relative to 2023.
With respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the first quarter was $12 billion, once again driven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure, with the largest component for servers followed by data centers. The significant year-on-year growth in CapEx in recent quarters reflects our confidence in the opportunities offered by AI across our business. Looking ahead, we expect quarterly CapEx throughout the year to be roughly at or above the Q1 level, keeping in mind that the timing of cash payments can cause variability in quarterly reported CapEx. With regard to Other Bets, we similarly have work streams underway to enhance overall returns.
Finally, as I trust you saw in the press release, we are very pleased to be adding a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share to our capital return program as well as a new $70 billion authorization in share repurchases. The core of our capital allocation framework remains the same, beginning with investing aggressively in our business as you have heard us talk about today. Given the extraordinary opportunities ahead, we view the introduction of the dividend as further strengthening our overall capital return program.
Thank you. Sundar, Philipp, and I will now take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. I have two. The first one, I wanted to ask about overall search behavior. Philipp, I know you talked in the past about how overall query trends continue to grow. Can I ask you to drill a little bit more into monetizable and commercial query trends? Has there been any changes in sort of your commercial query trends growth. There's just been all these new entrants moving around in e-commerce. That is my first one.
Then the second one for Ruth, when you talked about sort of more efforts to moderate expense growth from here, can you just sort of give us some examples of areas where you still see the potential for more optimization or work streams in place to continue to durably reengineer the OpEx base as we go throughout 2024. Thanks, Brian. To your first question, look, I think broadly, we've always found that over many years, when things work well on the organic side, monetization follows. So typically, the trends we see carry over well. Overall, I think with generative AI in Search, with our AI overviews, I think we will expand the type of queries we can serve our users. We can answer more complex questions as well as, in general, that all seems to carry over across query categories. Obviously, it's still early, and we are going to be measured and put user experience at the front, but we are positive about what this transition means. And on the second question in terms of the various work streams, as both Sundar and I said, we remain very focused on ongoing efforts to slow the pace of expense growth, what we've been calling durably reengineering our cost base. And I made this point in opening comments, but we are very cognizant of the increasing headwind we have from higher depreciation and expenses associated with the higher CapEx, and so these efforts are ongoing. And they're very much the same that we've talked with you about previously. It starts with product and process prioritization, all of the work around organizational efficiency and structure. These are ongoing.
And so as an example, the work that Sundar talked about, combining devices and services with our platforms and ecosystems, product area is a really good example because unifying the teams not only helps us deliver higher-quality products and experiences, but we think it enables us to move with greater velocity and efficiency.
And then the other work streams we've talked to you about in the past, like all of the work around technical infrastructure, which Sundar alluded to; streamlining operations within the company through the use of AI; what we're doing with procurement with our suppliers and vendors, which he also referenced; the work you've seen on real estate optimization, these are all ongoing work streams, which is why we have them under the umbrella, durably reengineering our cost base, and they are ongoing. Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Sundar, you talked about bringing more generative AI features into the main Search page. Can you just talk about what kind of queries or scenarios do you think that that's working best for so far? And just how we should think about the cadence of continuing to adopt more of those features within core search.
And then Ruth, on CapEx spending, the $12 billion in 1Q, can we assume that run rating that and above is reasonable for this year? And I know it's very early, but should we generally expect higher CapEx next year as well? Thanks, Doug. On SGE in Search, we are seeing early confirmation of our thesis that this will expand the universe of queries where we are able to really provide people with a mix of actual answers linked to sources across the Web and bring a variety of perspectives, all in an innovative way. And we've been rolling out AI overviews in the U.S. and the U.K., trying to mainly tackle queries which are more complex, where we think SGE will clearly improve the experience. We've already served billions of queries and it seems to cut across categories, but we are still continuing our testing. And we are metrics-driven in these areas. But I am optimistic that it clearly improves the user experience. Users are telling us that. And we are seeing it in our metrics, and we'll continue evolving it through the course of this year. And then in terms of CapEx, as I said in opening comments, we do expect the quarterly CapEx throughout the year to be roughly at or above the $12 billion cash CapEx we had here in Q1. As I said, you can always have variability in the reported quarterly CapEx just due to the timing of cash payments, but roughly at or above this level. And it really goes to Sundar's opening comment that we're very committed to making the investments required to keep us at the leading edge in technical infrastructure to support the growth in Cloud, all the innovation in Search that he and Philipp has spoken about and our lead with Gemini.
I will note that nearly all of the CapEx was in our technical infrastructure. We expect that our investment in office facilities will be about less than 10% of the total CapEx in 2024, roughly flat with our CapEx in 2023, but is still there. And then with respect to 2025, as you said, it's premature to comment so nothing to add on that. Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Maybe just one question of a big picture nature for Sundar. Sundar, if we come back to your earlier comments at the beginning of the call and framing up longer-term initiatives and longer-term narratives, I wanted to know if you could talk a little bit about both the opportunities and the challenges of operating at scale in a time like this where there's a lot of technology innovation going on and how you see the elements of trying to strike a balance towards moving the organization forward while still continuing to both invest for growth as well as balance margins. Thanks, Eric. Great question. Obviously, I think the AI transition, I think it's a once-in-a-generation kind of an opportunity. We've definitely been gearing up for this for a long time. You can imagine we started building TPUs in 2016, so we've definitely been gearing up for a long time. The real opportunities we see is the scale of research and innovation, which we have built up and are going to continue to deliver. I think for the first time, we can work on AI in a horizontal way and it impacts the entire breadth of the company, be it Search, be it YouTube, be it Cloud, be it Waymo and so on. And we see a rapid pace of innovation in that underlying. So it's a very leveraged way to do it, and I see that as a real opportunity ahead.
In terms of the challenges, I think it's been a mindset shift, which we've been driving across the company to make sure that we are embracing this opportunity but being very efficient in how we are approaching it, making sure we are redirecting our people to the highest priorities across the company, building on our 20 years of experience in driving machine efficiencies year-on-year so that we can put our dollars to work as efficiently as possible. So making sure balancing all of that moving forward in a very bold and responsible way at the same time. Those are the important things to get right from my perspective. Our next question comes from Stephen Ju with UBS. Philipp, I think it's approaching the 2-year anniversary for the launch of Ads on YouTube Shorts. And you've given us an update on monetization pickup sequentially. But with that in mind, I think YouTube has launched an array of ad products and automation tools to help advertisers transfer what they're doing to the vertical screen. So how is this translating into buy-in among your advertiser clients?
And secondly, based on what you've seen over the last 2 years, are there any structural reasons that you can cite as to why the monetization cannot match what is already the case on the horizontal screen? Yes. Look, this is a great question, first of all. I mean, let's start with the fact that YouTube performance was very strong in this quarter. And on Shorts specifically in the U.S., I mentioned how the monetization rate of Shorts relative to in-stream viewing has more than doubled in the last 12 months. I think that's what you were referring to. And yes, we're obviously very happy with this development.
The way to think about it is advertisers really only spend with us when they see a positive ROI. So you can assume that this wouldn't be happening unless it were to work for advertisers in the short term and also in the long term. That's an important part, I think.
Overall, Shorts is a long-term bet for the business. It has really helped us respond to both creator and viewer demand for short-form video. We talked about the strong growth, averaging 70 billion daily views. I mentioned the number of channels uploading has increased 50% year-over-year, so again, very happy with us development. And to your question, structural reasons, whether we can't get to a match here, I have a hard time seeing those at the moment over time. Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America. I'm going to ask another one on CapEx. It seems to be your biggest investment area. Just first, you saw the big uptick the last 2 quarters, but you've been investing in AI for years. Is the uptick because supply is getting easier to get? Or do you see more opportunities with the available supply to really fuel AI? So has the GPUs and everything gotten better that you feel more, investing more? And then thinking about the returns, both for Advertising and Cloud on the CapEx, do you feel like this is a higher cost of doing business? Or do you think this is an opportunity to even get better returns on your capital spend than you've had in the past? So the increase in CapEx, as Sundar said and I said, really reflects the opportunity we continue to see across the company. It starts with all that we're doing in support of the Gemini foundational model but then also, clearly, the work across Cloud, on behalf of Cloud customers, and the growth that we're seeing with GCP and the infrastructure work there, and then, of course, as both Sundar and Philipp talked about the application across Search, YouTube and, more broadly, the services that we're able to offer. So it's the growing application and our focus on ensuring that we have the compute capacity to deliver in support of the services and opportunities we see across Alphabet.
And it really goes to the second part of your question, which is that as we're investing in CapEx and applying it across our various businesses, it opens up more services and products, which bring revenue opportunities. And we're very focused on the monetization opportunity. It does underlie everything that we're doing in Google Services and Google Cloud. And as Sundar noted, we're, at the same time, very focused on the efficiency of all elements of delivering that compute capacity from hardware, software and beyond. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore. This is Jian Li for Mark Mahaney. A couple of questions. One, just maybe an expansion on the Search, query questions on before, more like Search volume, and maybe in the context of the off-Google environment like AI chat bot, for example, we've seen kind of Meta AI directing to Google Search results. Do you think there's actually a scenario where like AI system can create a step function change in Search volume or use cases of Google? If you can give us more color on what are you seeing right now or what are you expecting to see in that area.
And then the second question on just the comment of YouTube and Cloud exiting at $100 billion run rate. What is informing this outlook or visibility for you? If you can talk about, is it driven by any sort of Cloud demand inflection or step change in the gen AI workload demand, if you can flesh it out a little bit? On your first question, look, I said this before but to be clear, we view this moment as a positive moment for Search. And I think it allows us to evolve our product in a profound way. And Search is a unique experience. People come, be it if you want answers, if you want to explore more, if you want to get perspectives from across the web, and to be able to do it across the breadth and depth of everything they are looking for and the innovation you would need to keep that up, I think it's what we've been building on for a long time. And so I feel we are extraordinarily well set up, particularly given the innovation path we are on. And overall, I view this moment as a positive moment. So that's how I would say it.
On the second part, Ruth? Sorry, what was it? YouTube and Cloud. Yes, in terms of your comment about $100 billion exit rate for YouTube and Cloud, what's driving this visibility for you and any kind of inflection you're seeing in the Cloud demand? I would just say from Sundar's opening comments, it's just the ongoing momentum that we've seen in the business that we've been talking about, the ongoing growth and strong performance. And so what we were really getting at in that comment, what Sundar was getting at, is that we've continued to build strong businesses over time, and that just helps dimension it. We had similar comments last quarter when you talk about our subscription business. We're really proud of all the work that the teams are doing across the company, building new, strong opportunities, delivering for our users, for customers, for advertisers in profound ways. And so it was just helping to dimension what we have built over the years. Our next question comes from Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo. Two, if I may. First on GCP, you had nice acceleration in the quarter. Could you talk a little bit about the opportunities and constraints upon GCP's ability to continue to address that large addressable market and accelerate growth? Is it more sales-oriented? Is it more product sales solutions or both? And do you plan to address most of these organically? Or could a partner approach work for you?
And then the second one, just more detail on YouTube and sports rights. Could you reiterate your view on further live sports rights? There's some larger, mostly in the U.S., league rights coming up soon and will be more over the next several years. Could you just talk about your philosophy there beyond NFL Sunday Ticket? Look, on the Cloud side, obviously, it's definitely a point of inflection overall. I think the AI transformation is making everyone think about their whole stack, and we are engaged in a number of conversations. I think paid AI infrastructure, people are really looking to Vertex AI, given our depth and breadth of model choice, or using Workspace to transform productivity in your workplace, et cetera. So I think the opportunities there are all related to that, both all the work we've built up and AI being a point of inflection in terms of driving conversations. I think you'll see us do it both organically and with a strong partner program as well. So we'll do it with a combination.
And the challenges here, always, there are switching costs to Cloud and the challenges we see is how do we make it easier for people. There's a lot of interest, but there's definitely barriers in terms of people switching. And so that's an area where we are constantly investing to make it easier for our customers. And with regard to your sports rights question, look, I mean, we've had long-standing and significant partnerships with the most popular sports league here in the U.S., around the globe, federations teams, athletes, broadcasters. And obviously, these partnerships, in combination with our very vast audience of sports fans, drives investment in subscription experiences across many offerings: NFL Sunday Ticket, YouTube TV, YouTube Primetime Channels and so on. But there's nothing that we have to announce at the moment. We're obviously always looking at where we can create more value for our users, for our advertisers, for creators, but nothing specific to talk about at this moment. Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Sundar, I had a question about smartphone-based AI searches. So you guys are powering all these new AI interactions and searches on Pixel and on Samsung devices. And I think there's speculation that Gemini might be used on iOS in a future state. So the question is, as users start searching on smartphones and those searches are basically rendered on the model, on the phone, without accessing the web, how do you guys anticipate monetizing some of these smartphone-based behaviors that are kind of run on the edge? Any thoughts on that? Look, I think if you look at what users are looking for, people are looking for information and an ability to connect with things outside. So I think there will be a set of use cases which you will be able to do on device. But for a lot of what people are looking to do, I think you will need the richness of the cloud, the Web and you have to deliver it to users. So again, to my earlier comments, I think through all these moments, you saw what we have done with Samsung with Circle to Search. I think it gives a new way for people to access Search conveniently wherever they are. And so we view this as a positive way to bring our services to users in a more seamless manner. So I think it's positive from that perspective.
In terms of on-device versus cloud, there will be needs which can be done on-device and we should to help it from a privacy standpoint. But there are many, many things for which people will need to reach out to the cloud. And so I don't see that as being a big driver in the on-cloud versus off-cloud in any way. And our last question comes from Colin Sebastian with Baird. I guess first, a follow-up on some of the questions on SGE in the core Search. I guess I'm wondering, along with some of those changes in behavior, is there a way to quantify that overall engagement shift, whether that's an increase in time spent or the level of increase in queries for both sort of traditional search as well as more generative answers.
And then secondly, on the hardware road map, I assume later this year, we'll hear more about some of the products. But any areas of particular focus or that you would point out that we should keep in mind in terms of hardware launches in the back half? On the first question on Search, not much more to add to what I said, but what we have seen. And we've been in live experiments just for a few weeks in U.S. and U.K. on a slice of our queries, and all indications are positive that it improves user satisfaction. We see an increase in engagement, but I see this as something which will play out over time.
But if you were to step back at this moment, there were a lot of questions last year, and we always felt confident and comfortable that we would be able to improve the user experience. People question whether these things would be costly to serve, and we are very, very confident we can manage the cost of how to serve these queries. People worried about latency. When I look at the progress we have made in latency and efficiency, we feel comfortable. There are questions about monetization. And based on our testing so far, I'm comfortable and confident that we'll be able to manage the monetization transition here well as well. It will play out over time, but I feel we are well positioned. And more importantly, when I look at the innovation that's ahead and the way the teams are working hard on it, I am very excited about the future ahead. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any further remarks. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter 2024 call. Thank you, and have a good evening. Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's conference call.

And now I'll turn the call over to Sundar. Thank you, Jim, and hello, everyone. I'm really pleased with our results this quarter. They showed tremendous ongoing momentum in Search and great progress in cloud with our AI initiatives driving new growth. Search had another excellent quarter. And in terms of product innovation, we are seeing great progress with AI Overviews.
In Q2, cloud reached some major milestones. Quarterly revenues crossed the $10 billion mark for the first time, at the same time passed the $1 billion mark in quarterly operating profit. Year-to-date, our AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions for cloud customers have already generated billions in revenues and are being used by more than 2 million developers.
As I spoke about last quarter, we are uniquely well positioned for the AI opportunity ahead. Our research and infrastructure leadership means we can pursue an in-house strategy that enables our product teams to move quickly. Combined with our model building expertise, we are in a strong position to control our destiny as the technology continues to evolve. Importantly, we are innovating at every layer of the AI stack, from chips to agents and beyond, a huge strength.
We are committed to this leadership long term. This was underscored by the announcements we made at I/O, Cloud Next and Google Marketing Live, and we'll touch on many of them here. Today, I'll start with Search, then move to our AI momentum more generally, followed by cloud, YouTube and some closing thoughts.
Let's dive in. Over the past 25 years, we have continued to reimagine and expand Google Search across many technological shifts. With AI, we are delivering better responses on more types of search queries and introducing new ways to search. We are pleased to see the positive trends from our testing continue as we roll out AI Overviews, including increases in Search usage and increased user satisfaction with the results.
People who are looking for help with complex topics are engaging more and keep coming back for AI Overviews. And we see even higher engagement from younger users aged 18 to 24 when they use Search with AI Overviews. As we have said, we are continuing to prioritize approaches that send traffic to sites across the web. And we are seeing that ads appearing either above or below AI Overviews continue to provide valuable options for people to take action and connect with businesses.
Beyond AI Overviews, AI expands the types of queries we are able to address and opens a powerful new ways to Search. Visual search via Lens is one. Soon, you'll be able to ask questions by taking a video with Lens. And already, we have seen that AI Overviews in Lens leads to an increase in overall visual search usage. Another example is Circle to Search, which is available today on more than 100 million Android devices.
We are seeing tremendous momentum from our AI investments. More than 1.5 million developers are now using Gemini across our developer tools, and we recently unveiled new models that are more capable and efficient than ever. Gemini now comes in 4 sizes with each model designed for its own set of use cases. It's a versatile model family that runs efficiently on everything from data centers to devices.
At 2 million tokens, we offer the longest context window of any large-scale foundation model to date, which powers developer use cases that no other model can handle. Gemini is making Google's own products better. All 6 of our products with more than 2 billion monthly users now use Gemini. This means that Google is the company that's truly bringing AI to everyone. Gemini is powering incredibly helpful features in Search, Workspace, Google Messages and more. At I/O, we showed new features coming soon to Gmail and to Google Photos. Soon, you'll be able to ask Photos questions like, what did I eat at that restaurant in Paris last year?
For a glimpse of the future, I hope you saw Project Astra at I/O. It shows multimodal understanding and natural conversational capabilities. We've always wanted to build a universal agent, and it's an early look at how they can be helpful in daily life. Our AI product advances come from our long-standing foundation of research leadership as well as our global network of infrastructure.
In Q2, we announced our first data center and cloud region in Malaysia and expansion projects in Iowa, Virginia and Ohio. Our TPUs are a key bet here, too. Trillium is the sixth generation of our custom AI accelerator, and it's our best-performing and most energy-efficient TPU to date. It achieves a near 5x increase in peak compute performance per chip and a 67% more energy efficient compared to TPU v5e. And the latest NVIDIA Blackwell platform will be coming to Google Cloud in early 2025. We continue to invest in designing and building robust and efficient infrastructure to support our efforts in AI given the many opportunities we see ahead.
Of course, as we do this, we'll continue to create capacity by allocating resources towards our highest priorities. We are relentlessly driving efficiencies in our AI models. For example, over the past quarter, we have made quality improvements that include doubling the core model size for AI Overviews while at the same time improving latency and keeping cost per AI Overviews served flat. And we are focused on matching the right model size to the complexity of the query in order to minimize impact on cost and latency.
Separately on our real estate investments, we are taking a measured approach to match the current and future needs of our hybrid workforce as well as our local communities.
Next, Google Cloud. We continue to see strong customer interest, winning leading brands like Hitachi, Motorola Mobility and KPMG. Our deep partnership with Oracle significantly expanded our joint offerings to their large customer base. Our momentum begins with our AI infrastructure, which provides AI start-ups like Essential AI with leading cost performance for models and high-performance computing applications.
We continue to drive fundamental differentiation with new advances since Cloud Next. This includes Trillium, which I mentioned earlier, an A3 Mega powered by NVIDIA H100 GPUs, which doubles the networking bandwidth of A3.
Our enterprise AI platform, Vertex, helps customers such as Deutsche Bank, Kingfisher and the U.S. Air Force build powerful AI agents. Last month, we announced a number of new advances. Uber and WPP are using Gemini Pro 1.5 and Gemini Flash 1.5 in areas like customer experience and marketing. We broadened support for third-party models including Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet and open-source models like Gemma 2, Llama and Mistral. We are the only cloud provider to offer grounding with Google Search, and we are expanding grounding capabilities with Moody's, MSCI, ZoomInfo and more.
Our AI-powered applications portfolio is helping us win new customers and drive upsell. For example, our conversational AI platform is helping customers like Best Buy and Gordon Food Service. Gemini for Workspace helps Click Therapeutics analyze patient feedback as they build targeted digital treatments. Our AI-powered agents are also helping customers develop better-quality software, find insights from their data and protect their organization against cybersecurity threats using Gemini. Software engineers at Wipro are using Gemini Code Assist to develop, test and document software faster. And data analysts at Mercado Libre are using BigQuery and Looker to optimize capacity planning and fulfill shipments faster.
Cybersecurity risks continue to accelerate, and the number of breaches continue to grow, something we all see in the news every day and that our Mandiant teams help manage. Our strong track record of uptime, quality control and reliability make Google Cloud the trusted security choice for organizations like Fiserv and Marriott International. In Q2, we infused AI throughout our security portfolio, helping TELUS strengthen its proactive security posture.
Turning next to YouTube. YouTube is focused on a clear strategy, connecting creators with a massive audience and enabling them to build successful businesses through ads and subscriptions while helping advertisers reach their desired audience. We had a great brand cast this quarter, and Philipp will say more. I'm pleased with the progress here. YouTube has remained #1 in the U.S. streaming watch time according to Nielsen. Views of YouTube Shorts and Connected TVs more than doubled last year, and we are making it easier for creators to add captions and turn regular videos into Shorts.
Next, on Android and Pixel. We joined Samsung for their Galaxy Unpacked event a few weeks ago, and we shared that Samsung's new devices will include the latest AI-powered Google updates on Android. It was a great event. I'm looking forward to our Made by Google event happening in August. We'll have lots to share around Android and the Pixel portfolio of devices. Our Pixel line is doing well. We recently introduced a new Pixel 8a powered by our latest Google Tensor G3 chip. It provides beautiful AI experiences like Circle to Search, Best Take and a Gemini-powered AI assistant.
In Other Bets, I'm really pleased with the progress  Waymo is making, a real leader in space and getting rave reviews from users. Waymo served more than 2 million trips to date and driven more than 20 million fully autonomous miles on public roads. Waymo is now delivering well over 50,000 weekly paid public rides, primarily in San Francisco and Phoenix. And in June, we removed the wait list in San Francisco, so anyone can take a ride. Fully autonomous testing is underway in other Bay Area locations without a human in the driver seat.
Before I close, I want to acknowledge that today is Ruth's final earnings call. Let me take a moment to thank her for all she has done for Google and Alphabet as our longest-serving CFO. I'm excited to continue to work with her in her new role. And I look forward to welcoming our newly appointed CFO, Anat Ashkenazi. She starts next week, and you'll hear from her on our call next quarter.
Thanks, as always, to our employees and partners everywhere for a great Q2. With that, over to you, Philipp. Thanks, Sundar, and hello, everyone. Starting with performance, Google Services delivered revenues of $73.9 billion for the quarter, up 12% year-on-year. Search and other revenues grew 14% year-on-year, led by growth in the retail vertical followed by financial services. YouTube ads revenues were up 13% year-on-year, driven by growth in brand as well as direct response. Network revenues declined 5% year-on-year. In subscriptions, platforms and devices, year-on-year revenues increased 14%, driven again by strong growth in YouTube subscriptions.
For the rest of my remarks, I want to double-click on 2 topics: first, how we are applying AI across the marketing process to deliver an even stronger ads experience; second, YouTube's position as the leading multiformat platform. So let me start by sharing some of the ways we're applying AI to bring more performance benefits to even more businesses.
Q2 brought several major opportunities to meet and learn from users, developers, creators and customers. From I/O to Brandcast, Google Marketing Live and [ Cannes ], a growing number of our customers and partners are looking to understand how to successfully incorporate AI into their businesses. This quarter, we announced over 30 new ads features and products to help advertisers leverage AI and keep pace with the evolving expectations of customers and users. Across Search, PMax, Demand Gen and retail, we're applying AI to streamline workflows, enhance creative asset production and provide more engaging experiences for consumers.
Listening to our customers, retailers in particular have welcomed AI-powered features to help scale the depth and breadth of their assets. For example, as part of the new and easier-to-use Merchant Center, we've expanded Product Studio with tools that bring the power of Google AI to every business owner. You can upload a product image from the AI with something like feature this product with Paris skyline in the background, and Product Studio will generate campaign-ready assets.
I also hear great feedback from our customers on many of our other new AI-powered features. We're beta testing virtual try-on and shopping ads and plan to roll it out widely later this year. Feedback shows this feature gets 60% more high-quality views than other images and higher click out to retailer sites. Retailers love it because it drives purchasing decisions and fewer returns.
Our AI-driven profit optimization tools have been expanded to Performance Max and standard shopping campaigns. Advertisers who use profit optimization and Smart Bidding see a 15% uplift in profit on average compared to revenue-only bidding.
Lastly, Demand Gen is rolling out to Display & Video 360 and Search Ads 360 in the coming months with new generative image tools that create stunning, high-quality image assets for social marketers. As we said at GML, when paired with Search or PMax, Demand Gen delivers an average of 14% more conversions.
The use cases we're seeing across the industry show the incredible potential of these AI-enabled products to improve performance. Let me briefly share 2 examples with you. Luxury jewelry retailer Tiffany leveraged Demand Gen during the holiday season and saw a 2.5% brand lift in consideration and actions such as adding items to carts and booking appointments. The campaign drove a 5.6x more efficient cost per click compared to social media benchmarks. Our own Google marketing team used Demand Gen to create nearly 4,500 ad variations for Pixel 8 campaign shown across YouTube, Discover and Gmail, delivering twice the clicks per rate at nearly 1/4 of the cost.
In addition to strengthening our ads products for customers, we continue to evolve our existing systems and products with improved models delivering further performance gains. In just 6 months, AI-driven improvements to quality, relevance and language understanding have improved broad match performance by 10% for advertisers using Smart Bidding. Also, advertisers who adopt PMax to broad match and Smart Bidding in their Search campaigns see an average increase of over 25% more conversions of value at a similar cost.
We'll continue to listen to our customers and use their feedback to drive innovation across our products. And as you can hear, I continue to be excited about the AI era for ads.
Now let's turn to YouTube. I've talked before about our approach to making YouTube the best place to create, watch and monetize. First, the best place to create. What sets YouTube apart from every other platform are the creators and the connection they have with their fans. Audience is tuning in to watch their favorite creators continue to grow. For example, 2 weeks ago, MrBeast's channel hit more than 300 million subscribers.
Next, the best place to watch. Our long-term investment in CTV continues to deliver. Views on CTV have increased more than 130% in the last 3 years. According to Nielsen, YouTube is the #1 most watched streaming platform on TV screens in the U.S. for the 17th consecutive month. Zooming out, when you look not just at streaming but at all media companies and their combined TV viewership, YouTube is the second most watched after Disney. And this growth is happening in multiple verticals, including sports, which has seen CTV watch time on YouTube grow 30% year-over-year.
Lastly, the best place to monetize. CTV on YouTube is continuing to benefit from a combination of strong watch time growth, viewer and advertiser innovation and a shift in brand advertising budgets from linear TV to YouTube. Our largest advertisers across verticals, including retail, entertainment, telco and home and personal care, are partnering with creators on ads and organic integrations.
Verizon, for example, worked with a YouTube creator and Verizon customer to show the many ways that plans and offerings can be customized to fit people's lives. Using AI-powered formats, they created sketches in multiple lengths and orientations to serve the right creative to the right viewer and drive people to their site. Verizon's creator ads had a 15% lower CPA and a 38% higher conversion rate versus other ads.
Turning to Shorts. Last quarter, I shared that in the U.S., the monetization rate of YouTube Shorts relative to in-stream viewing is showing a healthy rate of growth. Again, this quarter, we continue to see an improvement in Shorts monetization, particularly in the U.S. We're also seeing a very encouraging contribution from brand advertising on Shorts, which we launched on the product in Q4 last year.
Lastly, a few words on Shopping. Last year, viewers watched 30 billion hours of Shopping-related videos, and we saw a 25% increase in watch time for videos that help people shop. While it's early days, Shopping remains a key area of investment. At GML, we rolled out several product updates to YouTube Shopping, helping creators sell products to their viewers. These updates included product tagging where creators can tag products in their videos for viewers to discover and purchase, product collections and a new affiliate hub, a one-stop shop for creators to find deals and promotional offers from brands and track their affiliate earnings.
With that, I'll finish by saying a huge thank you to Googlers everywhere for their extraordinary commitment and to our customers and partners for their continued collaboration and trust. And Ruth, thanks for your amazing leadership and partnership over all these years.
Now for one last time, it's over to you. Thank you, Philipp, and thanks, Sundar, for those kind words. We had another strong quarter, driven in particular by performance in Search and Cloud as well as the ongoing efforts to durably reengineer our cost base. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook.
For the second quarter, our consolidated revenues were $84.7 billion, up 14% or up 15% in constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth. In terms of expenses, total cost of revenues was $35.5 billion, up 11%. Other cost of revenues was $22.1 billion, up 14%, with the increase driven primarily by content acquisition costs, followed by depreciation as well as the impact of the Canadian Digital Services Tax, which was applied retroactively.
Operating expenses were $21.8 billion, up 5%, primarily reflecting an increase in R&D partially offset by a decline in G&A with sales and marketing essentially flat to the second quarter last year. The increase in R&D was driven primarily by compensation, which was affected by lapping a reduction in valuation-based compensation liabilities in certain Other Bets in the second quarter last year followed by depreciation. The largest single factor in the year-on-year decline in G&A expenses was lower charges related to legal matters.
Operating income was $27.4 billion, up 26%, and our operating margin was 32%. Net income was $23.6 billion and EPS was $1.89. We delivered free cash flow of $13.5 billion in the second quarter and $60.8 billion for the trailing 12 months. As a reminder, last year, we had a timing benefit in the second and third quarters from a $10.5 billion deferred cash tax payment made in the fourth quarter, which depressed reported free cash flow growth this quarter and will do so again next quarter. We ended the quarter with $101 billion in cash and marketable securities.
Turning to segment results. Within Google Services, revenues were $73.9 billion, up 12%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $48.5 billion in the quarter were up 14%, led again by growth in retail followed by the financial services vertical. YouTube advertising revenues of $8.7 billion were up 13%, driven by brand followed by direct response advertising. Network advertising revenues of $7.4 billion were down 5%. Subscription platforms and devices revenues were $9.3 billion, up 14%, primarily reflecting growth in YouTube subscription revenues. TAC was $13.4 billion, up 7%. Google Services operating income was $29.7 billion, up 27%, and the operating margin was 40%.
Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $10.3 billion for the quarter, up 29%, reflecting, first, significant growth in GCP, which was above growth for Cloud overall and includes an increasing contribution from AI; and second, strong Google Workspace growth, primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat. Google Cloud delivered operating income of $1.2 billion and an operating margin of 11%. As to our Other Bets for the second quarter, revenues were $365 million and the operating loss was $1.1 billion.
Turning to our outlook for the business. With respect to Google Services, first, within advertising. The strong performance of Search was broad based across verticals. In YouTube, we are pleased with the growth in the quarter. We had healthy watch time growth, continued to close the monetization gap in Shorts and had continued momentum in Connected TV with brand benefiting in part from an ongoing shift in budgets from linear television to digital. As we look forward to the third quarter, we will be lapping the increasing strength in advertising revenues in the second half of 2023, in part from APAC-based retailers.
Turning to subscriptions, platforms and devices. First, we continue to have significant growth in our subscriptions business, which drives the majority of revenue growth in this line. However, there was a sequential decline in the year-on-year growth rate as we anniversaried the impact of a price increase for YouTube TV in the second quarter last year. The impact will persist through the balance of the year. Second, with regard to platforms, we are pleased with the performance in Play driven by an increase in buyers. Finally, with respect to devices, the most important point as we look forward is that our Made by Google launches have been pulled forward into the third quarter from the fourth quarter last year, benefiting revenues in Q3 this year.
Turning to Cloud, which continued to deliver very strong results. For the first time, Cloud crossed $10 billion in quarterly revenues and $1 billion in quarterly operating profit. As Sundar noted, year-to-date, our AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions for cloud customers have already generated billions in revenues and are being used by more than 2 million developers. We're particularly encouraged that the majority of our top 100 customers are already using our generative AI solutions. We continue to invest aggressively in the business.
Turning to margins. The margin expansion in Q2 versus last year reflects our ongoing efforts to durably reengineer our cost base as well as revenue strength. Our leadership team remains focused on our efforts to moderate the pace of expense growth in order to create capacity for the increases in depreciation and expenses associated with the higher levels of investment in our technical infrastructure.
Once again, headcount declined quarter-on-quarter, which reflects both actions we have taken in the first half of the year and a much slower pace of hiring. Looking ahead, we expect a slight increase in headcount in the third quarter as we bring on new graduates. As we have discussed previously, we are continuing to invest in top engineering and technical talent, particularly in cloud and technical infrastructure.
Looking forward, we continue to expect to deliver full year 2024 Alphabet operating margin expansion relative to 2023. However, in the third quarter, operating margins will reflect the impact of both the increases in depreciation and expenses associated with the higher levels of investment in our technical infrastructure as well as the increase in cost of revenues due to the pull forward of hardware launches into Q3.
With respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the second quarter was $13 billion, once again, driven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure with the largest component for servers followed by data centers. Looking ahead, we continue to expect quarterly CapEx throughout the year to be roughly at or above the Q1 CapEx of $12 billion, keeping in mind that the timing of cash payments can cause variability in quarterly reported CapEx.
With regard to Other Bets, we continue to focus on improving overall efficiencies as we invest for long-term returns. Waymo is an important example of this with its technical leadership coupled with progress on operational performance. As you will see in the 10-Q, we have chosen to commit to a new multiyear investment of $5 billion. This new round of funding, which is consistent with recent annual investment levels, will enable Waymo to continue to build the world's leading autonomous driving technology company.
To close, this is my 56th and last earnings call, 37 of them at Alphabet. So I have a few closing thoughts of gratitude. I've been so proud to be at Google and Alphabet as CFO and to work with some of the smartest people in the world every day. I think we have accomplished a lot in the last 9-plus years, and I am confident that progress will continue. Of course, I'm not going far, and I'm honored to have my new role, which I've been slowly working my way into during the past 11 months. And I look forward to continuing to work with Sundar and our great team.
Being CFO of one of the most important companies in the world has been the opportunity and responsibility of a lifetime. Google's mission of advancing technology and bringing information to people throughout the world is as relevant today as it was when I worked on its IPO. Technology has been a catalyst for economic growth throughout human history. The people on this call know that if a technological advancement is not the focus of every business and government, they will be left behind. Underpinning this is the need for sound and responsible investment. That has never been more important than today, and certainly, that is Google and Alphabet's focus.
I want to end by thanking Googlers around the world for the innovation and commitment that has enabled us to deliver such extraordinary products and services globally. I also want to thank our investors and analysts for your long-term support and your feedback. Thank you.
Sundar, Philipp and I will now take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. First, thank you, Ruth, for all the help and significant impact over the past decade. The first one, it's a little bit of a jump, I guess, for Sundar, Philipp or Ruth. I guess we're sort of 18 months, this fever pitch around a gen AI focus in the world. Maybe from any of your perspective, can you just sort of talk to us about areas where you've seen faster-than-expected traction or testing adoption of some of the AI, generative AI capabilities versus slower-than-expected traction and testing from a Google perspective? And then, Ruth, I appreciate all the comments about structurally reengineering the OpEx base. Are there any more tangible examples of areas you can talk to us about where you still see further ways to drive more efficiency across the company? Brian, thanks. I'll take the first part. I think it's a good question. Obviously, I think there is a time curve in terms of taking the underlying technology and translating it into meaningful solutions across the board, both on the consumer and the enterprise side. Definitely, on the consumer side, I'm pleased, as I said in my comments earlier, in terms of how for a product like Search, which is used at that scale over many decades, how we've been able to introduce it in a way that it's additive and enhances overall experience and this positively contributing there.
I think across our consumer products, we've been able -- I think we are seeing progress on the organic side. Obviously, monetization is something that we would have to earn on top of it. The enterprise side, I think we are at a stage where definitely there are a lot of models. I think roughly, the models are all kind of converging towards a set of base capabilities. But I think where the next wave is working to build solutions on top of it. And I think there are pockets, be it coding, be it in customer service, et cetera, where we are seeing some of those use cases are seeing traction, but I still think there is hard work there to completely unlock those. And on your second question -- first, thank you for your comments. Look, the reason we've consistently used the term, the phrase that we're focused on durably reengineering our cost base is because these are deep work streams. They're not tactical fixes, and we continue to build on them. And so the main areas that we've talked about are around product and process prioritization, around organizational efficiency and structure. Both of those are reflected in the headcount and the fact that headcount is down year-on-year. And across all of those -- as I said, across our entire leadership team, we remain focused on continuing to execute against them.
So in terms of the most recent examples, as we talked about last quarter with the combination of the devices and services product area with the platforms and ecosystems product area. We announced that back in April. And what we discussed last quarter and what we're seeing is that unifying teams across these organizations helps with product execution, and what we're really focused on is really adding to velocity and efficiency. So kind of the gift that keeps giving.
And then more broadly, all of the work streams that we've talked to you about before, we continue to remain focused on. A big one, very important one, is all of the efficiency efforts, the work streams around technical infrastructure and improving efficiency there. We're also working on the use of AI across Alphabet. We're working on continuing to build on what we've done with our centralized procurement organization. We're continuing to optimize our real estate portfolio. And so again, this is across our leadership team. These are efforts that all build to this phrase, durably reengineering our cost base. And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. One for Ruth and one for Sundar. Ruth, you've now had Google Services operating margins roughly 40% for the past 2 quarters. Just as you create more capacity to help offset the future investments, is it reasonable to think that you could sustain at those kind of levels going forward? And then, Sundar, just as it relates to AI Overviews, you talked about the positive trends there. Can you just help us understand where you are, how far along in rolling out AI Overviews and then any more color around kind of click-through rates and monetization levels relative to your traditional searches? So in terms of the Google Services operating margin, it did reflect all the work that we're doing on durably reengineering the cost base. It also reflected the benefit of strong revenue performance in Search. And so what I tried to lay out in the comments as we look forward to the third quarter is operating margins will reflect the increases in depreciation and expenses associated with higher levels of our investment in technical infrastructure. It will also reflect higher expenses associated with the Pixel launch due to the pull forward. So those are important factors. I would say overall, company-wide, it's important to note that we do expect to continue to deliver full year '24 Alphabet operating margin expansion relative to 2023, but I did want to highlight those important points as we look forward to Q3. And Doug, thanks. On the AI Overviews, we are -- we have rolled it out in the U.S. And we are -- will be, through the course of the year, definitely scaling it up, both to more countries. And also, we have taken a conservative start, focused on quality, making sure the metrics are healthy and so on. But you will see us expand the use cases around it, and we'll touch definitely more queries. All the feedbacks we have seen are positive. And on the monetization side, I think Philipp has touched upon it. Maybe, Philipp, anything more you want to add there? Yes. Yes. Look, innovation and improvements to the user experience on Search have historically opened up new opportunities for advertisers. We talked about this before. We saw this when we navigated from desktop to mobile, for example. And we can see gen AI obviously expand the types of questions we can help people with, as Sundar mentioned. And as we said before, people are finding ads, either above or below AI Overviews, helpful. We have a solid baseline here from which we can innovate. And as you have probably noticed at GML, we announced that soon we'll actually start testing search and shopping ads in AI Overviews for users in the U.S., and they will have the opportunity to actually appear within the AI Overview in a section clearly labeled as sponsored when they're relevant to both the quarry and the information in the AI Overview, really giving us the ability to innovate here and take this to the next level. Thank you. Best of luck, Ruth, in your new role. Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson with Moffett. I have 2, one for Sundar and one for Philipp. Sundar, on decision this week to not deprecate cookies. I know it's been a long journey. Can you talk a bit about what we should expect in terms of your experience in Chrome and why the company makes a decision not to go down the path on deprecating cookies. And then Philipp, I know it's only 1 quarter. It's interesting that Search is growing faster than YouTube, which surprised some of us. But can you talk about what factors you think are behind differences in growth rates between these markets? And is there anything on the AI front that you could see maybe reaccelerating YouTube growth as you've seen happen with Search? Michael, on cookies, look, I think, obviously, we are super committed to improving privacy for users in Chrome. And there was the whole focus around Privacy Sandbox, and we remain committed on the journey. But on third-party cookies, given the implications across the ecosystems and considerations and feedback across so many stakeholders, we now believe user choice is the best path forward there. And we'll both improve privacy by giving users choice, and we'll continue our investments in privacy-enhancing technologies. But it's obviously an area we will be taking feedback from the players in the ecosystem, and we are committed to being privacy first as well. Philipp? And on the second part of your question, maybe, Ruth, you want to jump in first? And then I take the rest, if needed. Absolutely. So Look, as we both noted, Search revenues really reflected broad-based growth across verticals. That was led by retail followed by financial services. I think your question really goes to the heart of the year-on-year growth comparison. And as both Philipp and I noted, we're really pleased with YouTube, the YouTube team, all that was done. It was driven by brand followed by direct response. And they have very strong ongoing operating metrics, which Philipp will comment on.
I think the important point to note, and I tried to tease out in opening comments, was that the deceleration in this year-on-year revenue growth for the second quarter versus the first quarter, primarily reflected the tougher comparison versus the first quarter because at that point, as you probably recall, YouTube was lapping negative year-on-year growth in Q1 last year. And then also Q1 benefited from the extra from leap year. And so what you're also seeing here is with YouTube, we were anniversary-ing the ramp in APAC-based retailers that began in the second quarter last year and foreign exchange headwinds as well that we noted. And so it's -- there are some timing issues going on. And what we're trying to highlight is the underlying operating strength. Back to you, Philipp. Yes, that was very comprehensive. Nothing really to add from my side here. The only thing I would say, adding to Brian's first question on areas where things are maybe taking longer. I think, look, we are all building multimodal models. At least Gemini has been natively multimodal from the ground up. But most of the use cases today that have been unlocked have been around the tech side. So in terms of getting real generative audio, video experience is working well. I think there is still -- it's going to take some time. But over time, obviously, it will be deeply relevant to YouTube. And so it's an area I'm excited about in the future. Your next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. I'll echo the thanks for Ruth for all the insights and partnership over the years on these earnings calls. Sundar, maybe first for you. In terms of Cloud and bringing AI to the enterprise, I wanted to know if you go a little bit deeper in terms of how you're seeing AI actually get adopted implemented, what it potentially could mean for the strategic positioning of the Cloud business and the potential for AI workloads to be a stimulant to revenue growth for Cloud first. And then following up the last set of questions on YouTube or really about the macro or the ad environment. What do you guys, as a team, continue to learn about the subscription side of YouTube and the appetite for consumers to engage with a broader array of media products at the subscription layer? Thanks, Eric. Look, on the Cloud and AI stuff, obviously, it's something which I think will end up being a big driver over time. I mentioned in my opening remarks, already, if you take a look at our AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions for cloud across everything we do, be it compute on the AI side, the products we have through Vertex AI, Gemini for Workspace and Gemini for Google Cloud, et cetera, we definitely are seeing traction. People are deeply engaging with the Gemini models across Vertex and AI studio. We now have over 2 million developers playing around with these things, and you are definitely seeing early use cases.
But I think we are in this phase where we have to deeply work and make sure on these use cases, on these workflows, we are driving deeper progress on unlocking value, which I'm very bullish will happen. But these things take time. So -- but if I were to take a longer-term outlook, I definitely see a big opportunity here. And I think particularly for us, given the extent to which we are investing in AI, our research infrastructure leadership, all of that translates directly. And so I'm pretty excited about the opportunity space ahead. And then on your second question with respect to subscriptions, implicit in your question, how strong is it. As I noted in opening comments, that overall line subscriptions platforms and devices delivered healthy growth, and that was led by subscriptions. And as we've said on many calls here in a row, the subscription revenue growth continued to be quite strong. It was driven by subscriber growth in both YouTube TV and YouTube Music Premium. And then the other component within that line is Google One that also delivered strong subscriber and revenue growth.
But I think the heart of your question is really around YouTube, and that is the heart of the revenues in that line. So it continues to be very strong. We see a lot of take-up in it, strong subscriber growth, really pleased with it. We did note that growth on that line decelerated due to anniversary-ing this YouTube TV price increase. But at the heart of it are people interested in the subscription offerings and [ is to take significant ]. We're really pleased with it. Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Just 2 questions on the AI CapEx. So it looks like from the outside at least, the hyperscaler industry is going from kind of an underbuilt situation this time last year to better meeting the demand with capacity right now to potentially being overbuilt next year if these CapEx growth rates keep up. So do you think that's a fair characterization? And how are we thinking about the return on invested capital with this AI CapEx cycle? And then related to that, do you think that the AI industry is close to or far away from hitting some kind of wall on foundation model improvement in AI training based on like lack of availability of new data to train on? Just your thoughts on that would be great. I think great questions. Look, I -- obviously, we are at an early stage of what I view as a very transformative area and in technology, when you're going through these transitions, aggressively investing upfront in a defining category, particularly in an area in which in a leveraged way cuts across all our core areas or products, including Search, YouTube and other services as well as fuels growth in Cloud and supports the innovative long-term bets and Other Bets is definitely something for us makes sense to lean in.
I think the one way I think about it is when we go through a curve like this, the risk of under-investing is dramatically greater than the risk of over-investing for us here, even in scenarios where if it turns out that we are over-investing, we clearly -- these are infrastructure which are widely useful for us. They have long useful lives, and we can apply it across, and we can work through that. But I think not investing to be at the front here, I think, definitely has much more significant downside.
Having said that, we obsess around every dollar we put in. Our teams are -- work super hard. I'm proud of the efficiency work, be it optimization of hardware, software, model deployment across our fleet. All of that is something we spend a lot of time on, and that's how we think about it.
To your second question on whether -- how do the scaling laws hold? Are we hitting on some kind of wall or something? Look, I think we are all pushing very hard, and there's going to be a few efforts which will scale up on the compute side and push the boundaries of these models. What I would tell is regardless of how that plays out, I still think there is enough optimizations we are all doing, which is driving constant progress in terms of the capabilities of the models. And more importantly, taking them and translating into real use cases across the consumer and enterprise side, I think on that frontier, I think there's still a lot of progress to be had. And so we are pretty focused on that as well. Our next question comes from Stephen Ju with UBS. Okay. So Sundar, I guess to ask the AI question a different way, as we talk to some of the model builders out there, it looks like the initial use cases are more on the cost savings or efficiency side. But when do we -- when do you think we'll start thinking about products that can help revenue generation for the Fortune 500, Fortune 1000 companies, which is probably something that can hopefully create greater value over time versus just cutting costs? And Philipp, listening to what will be, I guess, Ruth's final comments on YouTube on these public calls -- and thank you, by the way, Ruth, for all the help. I couldn't help but notice that the bigger factors were brand followed by direct response. And if we continue to think that the one you bring up first is the larger factor and tying this into your prior commentary about shopping being an important consideration, when do you think we'll start talking about direct response being a much bigger contributor to YouTube's growth versus brand? On the first part of the question, look, I think the technology's horizontal enough, it can apply on both sides. If you take a use case like improving the customer service experience, it is part of it, which is driving efficiencies. And you can look at it from a cost standpoint, but you could also be overall improving the experience, improving conversion, driving the funnel better, and so increasing basket size if you're a retail e-commerce player, et cetera. So we are seeing people experiment across both sides. And so I think you will see it play out across both sides. Philipp, on the second one? Yes. On the second one, look, on the direct response side, as you know, it's about driving and converting commercial intent and customers are obviously benefiting from including video in their AI-powered campaigns. It could be PMax. It could be Demand Gen and obviously using our automated tools to enhance and create video creatives. And we're very, very optimistic about this path. On average, advertisers who run both image and video ads with Demand Gen campaigns see 6% more conversions per dollar than those running image-only ads and discovery. And this is just one little example of how this can obviously boost your performance business. So that's a big part.
The brand side, as you know, Google AI continues to make it easier for brands to show up next to the content where viewers are obviously the most engaged. And they're finding it, as you can see from the numbers, a very effective way to drive awareness and consideration. And we're also quite excited about some of the recent launches on YouTube Shopping side, if you want to put that into the direct response bucket. And our last question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America. Great. I'll ask a couple of areas. First, on the cloud acceleration, would you characterize that as new AI demand helping drive that year-to-date? Or is that more of a rebound in just general compute and other demand? Or is AI really moving this forward and helping drive acceleration? And then I wanted to ask about your internal cost savings, which has been really strong. How are you using AI internally to help cut costs? Are you seeing better efficiencies with your engineers? And just would love to hear about how you're applying AI to cut your own costs. Great. Thank you for that. So overall, we're -- as both Sundar and I said, we're very pleased with the results in Cloud. And there is clearly a benefit as the Cloud team is engaging broadly with customers around the globe with AI-related solutions, AI infrastructure solutions and generative AI solutions. I think we noted that we're particularly encouraged that the majority of our top 100 customers are already using our generative AI solution. So it is clearly adding to the strength of the business on top of all that they're doing. And just to be really clear, the results for GCP, the growth rate for GCP is above the growth for Cloud overall.
And then I'll turn it to Sundar on the cost saving point, but just one point. We're really pleased as well that Cloud's margin improved as it did. And in part, that reflects the revenue strength that they delivered and all of the efficiency efforts that I've already spoken about. But looking ahead in Q3, we do expect the same seasonal pattern that you saw last year with respect to margin, and we are continuing to invest in the business. Look, I think specifically, if the question is about engineers and coding, et cetera, we definitely want to be on the cutting edge there. I think we are making these tools available to some of the most productive engineers and demanding engineers out there, and they are definitely kicking the tires hard. But I would say it's still all in very early stages, I think, particularly when it comes to writing high-quality secure code. But I think all the learnings, what we are gaining here will translate into our models and products, and that's the virtuous cycle which I'm excited by. So there's a lot more to come. Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any further remarks. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter 2024 call. Thank you, and have a good evening. Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release . the conference call is based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties . this quarter's results showed tremendous momentum in Search and great progress in cloud with our AI initiatives driving new growth .,0.0
