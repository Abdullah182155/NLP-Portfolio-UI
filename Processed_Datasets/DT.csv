After the speakers remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.

With me on the call today are John Van Siclen, Chief Executive Officer; and Kevin Burns, Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we will open up the call for a question-and-answer session.

With that, I’d like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, John Van Siclen. John? Thanks Michael. And I like to start by thanking all of you for joining us today on our first conference call as a public company. We are excited to have completed our successful IPO on August 1. This represented an important milestone for Dynatrace and one that further enhances our brand awareness and ability to execute the company’s long-term growth strategy.
We are also very pleased with the first quarter financial results, where we achieved 43% ARR growth to $438 million, and strong total revenue growth, driven by subscription and services revenue, which increased 36% year-over-year. We continue to focus on building a balanced business with strong growth and cash flow for greater durability over time.
As this is our first quarter as a public company, I wanted to provide a brief overview of Dynatrace’s transformation, a value proposition, and our market opportunity in addition to providing details on key drivers behind our recent performance. Dynatrace is a market leading software intelligence company, purpose built for the enterprise cloud. Every company and every industry is transforming into a software business.
While they interact with their customers, assure quality experiences, optimize existing revenue streams and create new ones, success or failure comes down to the software supporting these efforts. Dynatrace Software Intelligence sits at the core of these digital transformations to assure that run the business software always works perfectly for every interaction, every transaction, and every user journey.
Let’s step back a moment and talk about how we got here. Dynatrace is now 14 years old. We spent the first nine years building a category leader in APM, application performance monitoring. In 2014, after sending a dozen of our top product minds of to determine how monitoring would work in the future, we made a bold decision to reinvent our platform from the ground up, and in so doing, refresh our entire business model. This team realizes that the cloud would disrupt the entire icon world.
Everything would change. And if we seize the opportunity, we could redefine the market. Although we were already widely recognized as the APM leader, we decided to disrupt ourselves. And in so doing, disrupt the market. The result was a 2016 launch of Dynatrace, an all in one full-stack Cloud monitoring platform, with a powerful AI engine at the core. With the complexity, scope, and frequency of change these modern cloud ecosystems would experience we chose to put answers first versus simply pumping more data on glass and hoping IT teams could keep up.
This answers first approach brings highly differentiated value to our platform used cases of APM, cloud infrastructure monitoring, digital experience management, and [AI ops]. This new platform has been driving the company's growth ever since. At the end of our June quarter, the new Dynatrace platform comprise 75% of our total ARR, up from 70% at the end of our March quarter, and up from 39% a year ago.
The remaining 25% of ARR relates to our Classic products, which continues actively transition to our Dynatrace platform. We are now five quarters into what we believe is a 10 to 12 quarter transition, and our Classic Customer Dynatrace conversion program continues to run ahead of expectations. After launching the new platform, our go-to-market motion has also evolved.
We believe our customer acquisition process has become much more efficient with most customers now discovering and exploring Dynatrace through a frictionless free trial. We then further nurture our land and expand sales process through a growing number of direct enterprise sales of resources, value-added resellers, and system integrators.
With the platform that instruments and baselines, the entire cloud stack automatically, implementation is dramatically streamlined, and we are seeing a growing number of customers expanding beyond the traditional 5% barrier that continues to hinder our data gen 2 approaches.
At the end of our fiscal Q1, we had 1,578 Dynatrace platform customers, an increase from 1,364 at the end of the prior quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, the majority of these new customers to Dynatrace were net new logos to the business, with the balance converting to Dynatrace from our Classic days.
Once again, our net expansion rate across all Dynatrace customers was over 120%, consistent now for the past five quarters on increasingly larger customer cohorts. Given our innovative AI powered platform and streamlined go-to-market strategy, we believe we can capture a meaningful share of $18 billion and growing TAM, we estimate this in front of us.
With about 10% of forward target 15,000 global enterprise accounts having adopted the Dynatrace platform, and where Gartner estimates to be only 5% of applications instrumented from an industry perspective versus what we believe is a longer-term target that ranges between 30% and 50%.
There is plenty in growth potential to build the very large company over time. And when you add it to this, both ongoing cloud and application expansion, and our ability to add additional platform used cases, we believe there is significant opportunity to further expand our TAM as time goes on.
Now, let me provide some insights in the several new and expansion customers to illustrate our value differentiation along with the power of our land and expand approach. First, one of our new logos in Q1 was a large U.S. government agency that’s moving to a hybrid multi-cloud environment as part of an overall IT modernization program to improve access to benefits and services for hundreds of thousands of policyholders.
As with many Dynatrace customers, the move to the Cloud brings with it an exponential rise in complexity for resource strapped IT organizations. The advanced automation of Dynatrace and the answers first approach leveraging data, our AI engine has allowed this agency to dramatically reduce performance issues, improve operational efficiency, and accelerate their cloud migration and modernization efforts. As a side note, the U.S. Federal market is a relatively new market for us for which we see tremendous opportunity over time.
The next example I would like to share is an expansion customer. A major European auto manufacturer that has been moving to a hybrid multi-cloud environment standing across their own data centers plus AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. They have been using the competitors Gen 2 APM product and found it inadequate for their new stack environment. It was proving too cumbersome, too manual and with limited cloud naïve observability.
Although this customer started with a small taste of Dynatrace toward initial set of workloads several months ago, after experiencing the advanced automation of Dynatrace, their IT team was able to roll-out an additional 2,000 hosts and dozens of applications in just a few weeks after acquiring additional licenses.
With the continuous intelligent monitoring of data’s, their development and operations teams now focus on building value for their company versus wasting time to using a dashboard flowing through loss or searching for answers to problems that may or may not be impacting users.
Bottom line, these auto manufacturers gain greater efficiency, which translate into greater speed for innovation and their digital transformation. The final example I would like to share is a customer who converted from our classic products to the new Dynatrace platform. This is a company in the business of managing and running a large core operation option marketplace.
With our Dynatrace offering, they saw an opportunity to modernize their own application and infrastructure environment and shift to Azure. As we did a proof of concept with Dynatrace as part of our conversion process, a number of application teams that we had never been able to access previously became interested.
Before the cloud, these teams were separate, but with their new enterprise Cloud, these teams were sharing cloud resources and software services. As a result, with the conversion came an upsell to extend expand coverage to more than two times of workloads and there is potential for more. This conversion from Classic to Dynatrace took only six weeks from start to finish and that includes the planning and change management process time. This is very common.
The time and effort to convert it short, while the value realized from doing so is very compelling. Switching to the product front for a minute, we continue to innovate organically. In Q1, we announced expanded support for Kubernetes, a dynamic [indiscernible] environment we have automatically instrumented and monitored for some time now.
In the quarter, we extended our automatic analysis of Kubernetes performance now delivering full stack analysis of the Kubernetes clusters, their containers and the application workloads within in a single solution fully leveraging our AI engine data’s. In addition, we introduced first stage support for Red Hat OpenShift 4 environments, adding to our Google, AWS, and Azure coverage for Kubernetes making it easier than ever to continuously observe and manage an enterprise multi-cloud environment.
In addition, we experienced our observability coverage for hybrid clouds with the announcement of one agent support for CICS and IMS workloads on IBM mainframes, along with their associated integration and middleware frameworks.
Now, Dynatrace customers can maintain their end-to-end visibility from mobile or IoT device through mainframe regions and back. This unique deep application and infrastructure observability allows our mainframe customers to understand the impact cloud application workloads on expensive mainframe resources and optimize the behavior to better leverage these critical compute resources.
For 25 major releases per year and hundreds of minor releases to assure cloud ecosystem currency and compatibility, we continue to increase the capabilities and scope of our market-leading software intelligence platform for our enterprise customers.
As we look forward, fiscal 2020 is shaping up to be a very exciting year, and we couldn't be more excited about our future. We have reinvented our business on a fresh new technology stack, ideally suited for today's dynamic multi clouds. Our shift to subscription is essentially complete, the conversion of our classic customer base is approaching the halfway mark, and the efficiency of our new platform affords us is evident in our strong profitability profile.
There is a massive opportunity ahead of us. We plan to capture with continued commercial investments in sales and marketing and ongoing innovation in R&D. We're excited to know the operating as a public company, as we focus on building long-term success for our customers, long-term value for our shareholders and a great place to work for our employees.
With that, let me turn the call over to Kevin Burns, our CFO. Kevin? Thanks, John. It is great to connect with both existing and prospective shareholders in our first call as a public company. I'm pleased that we have strong financial results to share, which were even better than the ranges we shared in our S-1.
Before discussing our results in detail, as well as our guidance for the second quarter and fiscal 2020, I want to first review the important aspects of our business and revenue model considering that some of you may be new to the Dynatrace story.
As outlined in our S-1, and as we discussed during our roadshow, our focus and the long-term future of the company is the Dynatrace platform. All revenue associated with a Dynatrace platform is recognized on a rentable basis and reported as subscription revenue.
With respect to our classic offering, maintenance and SaaS revenues are recognized rapidly and run through the subscription revenue. Perpetual and term licenses for our classic offerings are recognized on delivery and reported as one-time license revenue on the P&L. Classic license has declined significantly and is now down to an insignificant percent of our revenue. Overall, we believe our transition to a subscription model is substantially complete and this is becoming apparent in total revenue growth.
Now, let me turn to our first quarter fiscal 2020 results. Our key financial metric as an organization is annual recurring revenue. For the quarter, ARR was $437.6 million, an increase of 43% year-over-year. The Dynatrace platform continues to increase as a percent of total ARR and was $326.3 million at the end of June, which as John said, was 75% of our total ARR.
The remaining 25% of ARR relates to our Classic offering, and we expect the majority of Classic customer base to convert to Dynatrace over the next two years, with most of the remaining conversion activity to occur in the next four to six quarters. As a reminder, the ARR growth opportunity is not the conversion. It is getting customers on to the Dynatrace platform, because from there, we can expand our footprint in ways that simply were not possible before.
In addition, for investors new to Dynatrace, we do not charge a conversion or upgrade fee to move to the new Dynatrace platform. And as a result, all of our ARR expansion is either footprint expansion or new logos to the business. If we quickly break down these two ARR growth drivers, during the quarter, we added 214 net new Dynatrace customers ending the quarter with 1,578 Dynatrace customers.
Consistent with recent quarters, net new customers for a healthy balance of adding new logos to the franchise, as well as classic customers moving to the Dynatrace platform. In addition to a steady flow of net new customers, our dollar-based net expansion rates remain above the 120% threshold that we have experienced over the last five quarters, since we ramped our efforts on the Dynatrace offering with existing customers.
We will continue to confirm this net expansion level on a quarterly basis, and at the end of the fiscal year, we plan to share a specific net expansion rate for the year. Importantly, please keep in mind that our net expansion rate excludes the upfront expansion that occurs when Classic customers convert to a Dynatrace platform. So, our reported net expansion rate only takes into account expansion with customers after they are on the Dynatrace platform.
Turning to revenue. Total revenue was $122.6 million. This was an increase of 25% on a year-over-year basis. The acceleration in total revenue growth is being driven by the strong growth in subscription revenue, which was $108.1 million, an increase of 39% year-over-year.
For the quarter, Classic license revenue was down to $3.8 million and represented only 3% of our quarterly revenue. Please keep in mind that this will be going to zero over the next four to six quarters as we wrap up the Classic conversion program.
From a growth standpoint, we believe the best way to think about our revenue growth is the combination of subscription and services revenue, which was $118.8 million in the quarter, representing 97% of total revenue, and an increase of 36% on a year-over-year basis.
Before moving to our profit metrics, I would like to point out that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results going forward unless otherwise stated, and that our non-GAAP measures exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles and other items as outlined in the press release.
Our non-GAAP gross margin was 82.3% for the first quarter, an improvement compared to 80.7% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Gross margins are benefiting from increasing subscription margins, due to the efficiency of the Dynatrace platform, which has one current base and over 90% of our customers are in a version released in the last 30 days.
Our non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $27.1 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 22%, up from 13% in Q1 of 2019. The increase in operating margin is largely driven by the fact that we are in the final stages of completing our transition to a subscription model, as historical revenue was negatively impacted when we moved from an upfront perpetual to a subscription model.
In addition, we had some margin overachievement in the first quarter of 2020 that was driven by a combination of revenue and the shifting of certain expenses from the first quarter to the balance of the year.
Finally, please keep in mind that our first quarter expenses do not include the cost of being a public company, which will show up in G&A going forward. Non-GAAP net income was $9.3 million and net income per share was $0.04, based on 238.6 million shares outstanding.
Turning to our balance sheet. As of June 30, we had cash and cash equivalents of $57.5 million. When looking at our leverage at the end of the first quarter, our net debt was $945 million. On a pro forma basis, taking into account the $590 million of net proceeds from the IPO, our net debt as of June 30 would have been $355 million. This represents a leverage ratio of 3.3 times, a trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA of $106.4 million.
Since the end of the first quarter, we've paid down $436 million of debt, and our current debt balance is $567 million. Going forward, the business will naturally de-lever, due to our healthy cash margins and we will steadily pay down debt over time, which we believe will create value for equity holders.
The last balance sheet metric that I want to share was our IPO, which was $614 million, up 83% over Q1 of last year. The current portion of our IPO, which we expect to recognize as revenue over the next 12 months was $354 million at the end of Q1, an increase of 62% year-over-year.
Looking at cash for Q1, our unlevered free cash flow was $45.8 million and it was $172 million on a trailing 12-month basis. To be clear, we have seasonality and we also have quarterly fluctuations in our unlevered free cash flow as we convert our customers from Classic to Dynatrace, as this may impact the timing of how and when we invoice our customers.
Before moving to guidance, I'd like to review a few items that will impact our GAAP results for the second quarter of fiscal 2020. First of all, we incurred cash fees of approximately $14 million related to the IPO and structuring that will hit the P&L or [indiscernible] in the second quarter. These are in addition to the IPO commissions that were netted against the IPO proceeds discussed previously.
Second, as a result of the spin of the [popular] mainframe business, we will also be recording a cash tax charge in the second quarter of $273 million. Please keep in mind that we received $273 million from the mainframe business pre-IPO, and that these funds will be used to pay the federal and state taxes and majority of which will be paid in the second quarter fiscal 2020 and the balance in early calendar year 2020. Overall, this is a neutral cash item to Dynatrace.
Finally, as disclosed in our S-1 and based on our IPO value, we're recording a one-time mark-to-market.com charge in the second quarter of $145 million.
Now, let me turn to guidance. For the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect total revenue to be in a range of $123 million to $124 million, representing year-over-year growth of 21% to 22%. We expect our non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $24 million and $25 million and non-GAAP net income of $0.04 per share. This assumes, approximately 270 million shares outstanding.
For the full fiscal year, we expect ARR to be in a range of $545 million to $550 million, representing year-over-year growth of 35% to 36%. Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $521 million to $524 million, representing year-over-year growth of 21% to 22%.
We expect our non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $112 million to $115 million and our non-GAAP net income in the range of $0.20 to $0.22 per share. This assumes approximately 278 million shares outstanding for the fiscal year.
In summary, we're very pleased with our performance in the first quarter and look forward to building a track record of success as we operate as a public company. We believe Dynatrace’s financial profile is unique, including its out scale, growth and cash flow. With a large hand in front of us in a market-leading position, we believe the company is very well positioned for the long-term.
With that, we will open the call up for questions. Operator? [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. Wonder if you can peel back the onion a little bit and just update us on where you are or where you finished the quarter in terms of the legacy conversions? What's left in front of us? And what kind of experience you're seeing in terms of the pace of those conversions? Hi, Sterling, how are you? So, as we said, the conversions are nearly halfway through at this point. 75% of ARR is now on Dynatrace, but the conversion process is about halfway through now after five quarters. We believe as we've talked about that it's a two-and-a-half to three-year conversion process, majority of those converting over the first two years or so, and we're very pleased with where we are right now. We're a little ahead of our internal plans and goals. Alright, great. And then the one follow-up is, as you think about the three areas of monitoring, APM, infrastructure and logging, can you give just – can you give me some kind of qualitative color in terms of the momentum that you're seeing in each one of those buckets on the new platform? Well, as you know, and maybe some of those who are listening in, so our platform, since day one, has always assumed complete full stack observability. So, whether if you're in the APM, an APM full stack customer, you get cloud infrastructure with it and the [AI ops] pieces as well, log comes with it, et cetera. So, from that standpoint, and most of our opportunities we enter through APM, since that's our sort of been our legacy and that's what customers know us for and the market knows us for best. That has plenty of momentum, as you can see in the numbers.
As far as cloud infrastructure-only environments, that's an expansion for us, and we're seeing good traction in that expansion. I mean, one of the unique characteristics of our platform is that our AI engine is at the core. And therefore, when someone adds a component, a new module, like infrastructure-only to extend the view, they also get the AI engine that stitches everything together, along with their full stack hosts.
So, that's that – and that – that's the same with digital experience management as well. You add that to the portfolio or to the platform and the AI engine also absorbs that view into the full stack, AI powered answers first of you. So, from that standpoint, we're seeing good traction on all those additional modules, but we do think about it, and the way we present ourselves to the market is much more of a platform than a set of piece parts. That makes sense. Thank you. Your next question comes from Matt Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Thanks. This is actually Matt Swanson on for Matt. You guys have had a very well-established international presence. Could you just talk a little about what you're seeing from a demand environment? And just from some of the recent earnings, we've heard some uneasiness in certain regions, so just what you're seeing out there? Yes. So, I appreciate the question. And you're right, we do have a pretty mature footprint, 40% to 45% of our business comes from outside North America. We haven't seen a real shift in demand, sort of negatively in any region. Part of that may be that we focus exclusively on the more modern cloud environments, the dynamic multi-cloud environments and those are sort of central to everyone's digital transformation around the world. So that, that may be part of the difference of what's keeping us at least at this point more resilient. Thanks. That's really helpful. And that's really interesting here you talk about the U.S. federal opportunity. Could you just expand a little bit more, I know, you said it's early days, but maybe how you look at that vertical and maybe what investments are in technology or go-to-market you think you might need to make to capitalize on that in the future? Sure. The U.S. Federal market is a very different market than the commercial market, those who've ever been close to it, or watch those or talk to others about it. It requires a longer-term investment horizon. And so, we hesitated to put that longer-term investment in place until we had a quality team and a quality sales leader who really understood that market space. And so, the last couple years, we started the investment, we're starting to see the payoff begin. But as I said, and you reiterated, it's early days, but promising.
One of the things that is important in this environment is make sure you get a [ramp] certification, which we’re in the process off, and that's also an important component to help build momentum – your long-term momentum in the federal space. Thank you. Your next question is from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Great, thank you. I just had two questions. Was one, wondering if you could share with us any trends that you’re seeing in the AI Ops marketplace and the AI Ops integration that you're offering? And then secondly, wanted to ask a little bit about the competitive environment. There was a competitor of yours who, I think, it was early August talks about kind of changing landscape from a competitive standpoint. But just wondering if you could kind of walk us through what you've been seeing? Thank you. So, from an AI Ops standpoint, we're seeing and I sort of reiterated some stories they're just a moment ago about customers, both new and existing and even converting customers. The – having AI at a core of our platform and really shifting from data on glass who answers first, approach where the answers come automatically in a very precise fashion.
So that it's extremely actionable. And the answers come within seconds of degradations and anomalies, ranked by user impact, that’s serving us extremely well from a differentiation standpoint, and more and more customers are CIOs and CTOs have it on their shortlist of additional automation for their IT organizations, because they know they're resource strapped [ph].
So, that's going extremely well. And as far as folks actually utilizing some of our new sort of old APIs to bring new data sources into the Dynatrace AI environment, that's been going well also. It's fairly early days. It's been six months since we've had those APIs available. But we're – with some of the used cases around service now integration F5, low balance kind of integrations, a number of things that are more out of the box now, it's accelerating. So, we're very pleased there.
As far as a competitive landscape in general, it – definitely the observability space is getting a lot of interest these days. We view observability as obviously a really important component, or modern cloud environments. But we also see it as just the first step, that the real value comes in the advanced automation and advanced analytics that come on top of the observability. And that's where we see the AI Ops investment that we made when we reinvented the platform really paying off. Great, thank you. Your next question is from Jennifer Lowe of UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Hi, thanks. This is Rakesh Kumar sitting in for Jennifer Lowe. So, you just bought a 40% ARR growth, plus ARR growth, which is totally impressive. I was wondering if you could talk about how you think of levers of ARR growth as it relates to net new logos versus conversions and expansion on conversion? I’ll pass it to Kevin. Yes, sure. This is Kevin. So, yes, as I'm sure you can see over the last couple of quarters, our ARR growth has been over 40%. And as we discussed during our road show and in our S-1, it really is a great combination of new logos to the business, as John mentioned earlier, majority of the additions in the quarter were new logos for the Dynatrace franchise. And then the other nice thing we're seeing is a really healthy in that expansion rate.
So, not disclosing the total number at this point, but it was north of 120% for the last three quarters, when we talked about that on a road show, it was in the high-130% range. So, really is a combination of getting new logos to the franchise, and then once they're on the Dynatrace platform, they're expanding very nicely. Got it. And then I have a follow-up. I was wondering if you could talk about sales productivity trends and how long is it taking for reps to ramp and hiring plans that you have for the year? So, we're not disclosing sort of our – all the hiring pieces and sales and et cetera, et cetera. But what I will say is that, we're in a better position than we've been in for two or three years now, from a hiring standpoint. Part of it is the momentum in the business, of course, attracts talent. But also, I think some of the positives online job site reviews relative to the company is also helping. So, from our standpoint, we're doing extremely well meeting our hiring goals, attracting talent and retaining talent. Thank you. Your next question is from Bhavan Suri of William Blair. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Hi, gentlemen, thanks, and congratulations there a nice job out of the quarter out of the gate there. I guess, maybe I just want to touch first on the DM attach rate, obviously, you sell that as a separate skew there. I'd love to understand a little bit more about what you've seen there in terms of adoption and the attach rates and how that’s trended in the recent quarters? Thank you. So, the digital experience management area, which is sort of the user experience components has been, we – we've had that module in our Classic product set for a while, it was just detached, sort of a separate product set. Right. In the Dynatrace platform it is an integrated module, where the AI engine pulls everything together into a single stitch together view from every tap click, swipe all the way through, all the infrastructure components of the back-end in a full stack view. So, we are seeing continued momentum in the attach rate. It’s interesting that the cloud, as we move to the cloud, a lot of interest went to just building the foundation for what we’re starting to see now is an acceleration, in fact, to the numbers that we had three, four years ago in our Classic world from an attach rate standpoint.
I don't have the exact stats to the attach rate. We're talking about how we want to bring that forward and present to the market and investment community. But it's been healthy and – in any place where there's users attached e-commerce, home banking, go down the list, those are perfect opportunities for solid attach rate for the [dem module]. No, John, that's helpful. I guess, maybe a more strategic question and maybe I should have asked this one first. But as you think about sort of the automatic instrumentation, the automation features of the new Dynatrace platform, it feels like it should make – it makes it easier for you to achieve greater penetration within customers, because it's much easier to deploy and manage.
I guess, is that the way to think about it? Because if you think about historically, maybe talk about a little bit, the average percentage of applications monitored by Classic customers and what's that look like historically? And sort of does that become meaningfully higher with Dynatrace platform because of the automatic instrumentation detection, the way the platform lights up, [indiscernible] the trends you've seen as customers, which sort of what that – you're seeing an expansion rate, obviously, but love to know, sort of number of applications or sort of – and is that the way to think about sort of that shift? Yes, sorry, if I misunderstood the first question, I thought you meant the digital experience. management piece. I did. I was – this is more strategic as you did. Thanks. You answered. Yes. Fair enough. But you're spot on that the automatic nature and I mentioned it in the expansion, customer that I was talking about just a few minutes ago, that people start with a taste, try a few modules, is this really work as advertise, say my people really wield the weapon in other words, and the minute they get the hang of how easy it is, the expansion is quite rapid. It's been more – much more rapid than the – than our Classic product set and continues to show up in the net expansion rate.
So, yes, the bulk of the net expansion today is additional applications. Going forward, we believe it'll be a nice consistent mix between additional applications and additional cross-selling of modules. Got it. Got it, helpful. Thank you, guys. I appreciate you taking my questions. Okay. Thank you. Your next question is from Richard Davis of Canaccord. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Hi, thanks very much. One of the areas that we've seen some of our companies try to pivot into is kind of government and things like that. Have you – to what extent do you feel that that's an opportunity and you know some companies – I can’t recall if you have said ramp or not, but that is one of the check marks and things like that. To what extent do you see that as an opportunity over the long run? Thanks. Yes, I was saying it is a huge opportunity. I mean I don't know where the U.S. government falls as far as a consumer technology these days used to be like one of the top Number 6, 5 or 6 countries worth spend. So, it is definitely a good size market space, but we are early days in it, mainly because it requires an ongoing investment for a while before you see the uptake, which we now starting to see beginning with. From a standpoint of [indiscernible] that’s something that’s in process, an important pieces of the project, but I think that just we are excited about that opportunity going forward, I thought the example, customer example as pertinent and I look forward to a lot more stories and success in that part of the market. Thank you very much. Your next question comes from [indiscernible] of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Thank you. My question goes back to the ARR question, so Kevin as you point grew 43% this quarter that’s three consecutive quarters, the ARR growth in the 40s, which accelerated from low 30s prior to that, and we all know that ARR is a pre-allude to future revenue. I guess my question is, how sustainable is that accelerated growth and doesn’t that stay in the 40s, but those are pretty impressive numbers, and I'm just trying to understand like because we get a question a lot from clients like okay, when the classic ARR goes away because you pointed out I think Kevin, that hey listen, when we convert we see much broader adoption and with the new Dynatrace platform, but you're also seeing the net retention that’s really high too. So, just trying to understand like has something changed out there in the market to like, that maybe that’s a second question, but related, how should we be thinking about that ARR growth going forward? Yes. I think, I’ll jump in and then maybe John can add to this as well, but I think there is couple of things that are behind us right now working in our favor. First of all, we’ve been ramping our sales organization over the last 12 to 24 months, and we expect to continue to do that, so you know that will increase some bookings. So, that’s one growth driver.
Second growth driver John mentioned is ease of use and implementation and the ability to scale out the Dynatrace, platform for existing customers is much more rapid and automatic compared to second generation monitoring. So, that’s driving higher net expansion rate. So, I think the combination [indiscernible] and as we are adding new logos and the core focus to the company over the last 12 months as well, you know that has tremendous opportunity. Our averaging ARR and the Dynatrace platform for customer today is north of $200,000, you know we think each one of those customers can be a million-dollar ARR opportunity for us over time. So, a lot of opportunity to continue to expand ARR brought new logos and in our updates. Okay. Has there anything, maybe John, is there something else in the market too, because APM as you guys know especially from your experience back with the Classic, it’s always made a lot of sense and there was a lot of promise, and even in the early 2000s and a lot of companies went after the opportunity Compuware/Dynatrace [indiscernible] and then all the others. And – but it never really became or never really fulfilled this promise, but we are seeing something today in Dynatrace, and also in others. And there is a lot of questions, competition is something that wasn’t asked a lot about right now on your call, but it will be, right, because there was other companies doing well too. I’m just trying to get a sense of, is there enough room for other to continue to do well? Has something changed in the market, that’s also helping you? I think there is a big disruptive shift that’s going around the cloud, you know we talked about it before. This isn't just applications going for the cloud and everything else [status quo]. This is the shift to the data centers to hybrid multi-clouds. And that’s requiring an entirely new set of tooling. So, think about 20, 30 years’ worth of tooling that’s been out there. All having to change over the next, 5 years to 10 years. That’s accelerating a shift to a modern set of platforms, and I say the platforms because in the cloud, you can’t go after it in the old way with the bag of tools. You have to think about it in much more holistic way because the entire stack is software.
So, with that disrupted shift and that class of what we’re traditional icon used cases, you really have a dramatic shifting moment. We saw that five years ago, we came to market four years ago with an initial sort of offering to get our feet wet. We took at enterprise three years ago starting in 2016 and we haven’t looked back. So, we're really pleased with the competitive position. I mean, the four sites we have is paying off, and this disruptive moment is only beginning, it’s on the innings for sure. And I think that’s what we’re seeing and that’s why the TAM expansion is so great and so rapid. Great. Thanks John, thanks Kevin. Your next question comes from Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Please go ahead, your line is open. Hi guys, this is [indiscernible] for Raimo. Thanks for taking my question and congrats again on the first quarter update, so my question is on the product roadmap, so if you could shed more light on, across if you look at obviously it is the unified platform, but if you look at the different used cases I guess across APM logs and infrastructure monitoring along with the AI Ops, I'm just wondering if you can give us a sense of the product priorities that you have like are those more focused in some of those areas or is it more consistent across the board? And I have a follow-up question to that. Good question and thank you for your kind words. Our investment is consistent across all of them really. They are all monetizable modules, and when you have something that is monetizable then you are going to put some effort into it. So, we have team on every one of those, but we think of as key used cases. The, we’re extremely strong in APM as you would expect, that’s, that we believe is the high ground.
It’s very difficult to do well at scale, and at the same time it’s essential for the way CIOs and CTOs and even CEOs now think about their digital transformations, but we do have significant investments in cloud infrastructure monitoring in the AI Ops space and in the digital experience space, which we also feel as a very strategic high ground for us as well.
So, in order to cover the Cloud, we’ve had to do all of these pieces because we do think of it as a full stack. And so, what we're doing now is sort of breaking out different pieces of the puzzle in the standalone sort of components for extensibility and reach beyond just the fall stack view that we started with, if that makes sense to you. That’s helpful guys. Follow-up to that is, the other part of the question is the pricing model. So, I mean, I'm just wondering if you can give us some more color on what you're seeing in the pricing environment because some of your competitors are sort of like talking about some new pricing models, maybe from our personal conversations you are hearing the same, so just wondering if you can give us more color on the pricing environment that you're seeing? Thank you. From a pricing standpoint, we have been, I would say, we listened to customers. I mean I really don't believe that the, you need to make sure that your customers are happy that you are easy to do business with and the rest, and I think we're being smart with how we manage our pricing and our licensing models. We have a fair amount of flexibility. We have a direct sales organization, 90% of our sellers are outbound in the market. We sell to enterprise customers who expect some flexibility, and we are pretty good at adapting license strategies that fit customers and help them expand our product set widely within their organizations. And I think you see that with the net expansion rates. I mean, if we’re really difficult and challenging you just wouldn't see that. So, I'm happy with how we're pricing. I'm happy with our flexibility in our licensing models, and I can only speak for ourselves, but that’s where we sit today. No need to change. Thanks guys. Your next question comes from Erik Suppiger of JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Hi, this is Joe Goodwin on for Erik. Thank you for taking our questions. I was hoping you guys could give us some color on what portion of customers are using Dynatrace for applications running on containers and then anything around how fast the containers business is actually growing? So, I don't have the exact numbers on Dynatrace customers running on containers, but what I can tell you is that nearly 100% of the Dynatrace customers are cloud-based customers. And the container world has been around for a little while now, whether they started with darker or what have you, but what we have seen in the last 18 months of the rapid shift toward Kubernetes has really been interesting to watch as people look for portability platform across sort of the multi-cloud strategy. And whether that’s 15% to 20% of our customers or whether it’s more than that today, I'm not sure, but what we do here from customers and surveys and so on what we've done is that cloud native workloads and contain or orchestrated environments are going to sleep through our enterprise customers to the tune of 80% to 90% over the next couple of years. Understood I should probably add on that, you know it’s actually a great situation for us because we purposely built for dynamic containerized environments. So, it’s great from our standpoint to see the rapid rise of this kind of dynamic orchestrated environments. Understood. And then just a quick follow-up, can you provide any insight and how much of a drag on gross margins was the cause of supporting the Classic product during the quarter? So, this is Kevin here, so we – as you know, we have a superefficient Dynatrace back [indiscernible] customers all of our customers are [indiscernible] when their data is in the cloud or behind the firewall. So, it’s superefficient there. The Classic product is winding down and you will see the margin expansion over time from a gross margin standpoint. So, we are not really breaking down how many dollars are going to be pulled out of that business, and we will continue to see as we have seen gross margin expansion going forward. I think the point is that the classic products that is not as efficient as Dynatrace, and you can sort of expect that from a totally new stack, four years five years versus some of the classic products that go back 12 to 15 years, if they are technology stack. Great. Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call over to John Van Siclen for closing remarks. Yes, thank you. I like to thank all of the investors and analysts for your time today, as well as I'd like to thank many customers we have, partners and employees who’ve helped us build a very strong company, you know we’re excited about the path we’re on, we’re excited about the opportunity ahead and we look forward to updating all of you in about 60 days from now. Thank you very much. Good evening. This concludes today's conference call.

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Michael Bowen, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you, operator.
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today to review Dynatrace's second quarter fiscal 2020 financial results.
With me on the call today are John Van Siclen, Chief Executive Officer; and Kevin Burns, Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we will open up the call for a question-and-answer session.
Before we start, I'd like to draw your attention to the safe harbor statement included in today's press release. During this call, we'll make statements related to our business that may be considered forward-looking within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21-E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements, including statements regarding management's expectations of future financial and operational performance and operational expenditures; expected growth and business outlook, including our financial guidance for the third fiscal quarter and full year 2020.
Forward-looking statements reflect our views only as of today. And except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements. Please refer to the cautionary language in today's press release and to our Form 10-Q, which was filed with the SEC on September 5, 2019; and our other SEC filings for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations.
During the course of today's call, we'll refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by Regulation G.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer; John Van Siclen. John? Thanks, Michael.
And I'd like to start by thanking all of you for joining us today. We are very pleased with the company's performance in the second quarter, which resulted in financial results and were better than our top line and bottom line guidance. I'm especially pleased that ARR increased by a robust 44% year-on-year to $471 million, with our new Dynatrace platform now making up 80% of total ARR, up from 75% a quarter ago.
Fueled by continued strong growth in ARR, our subscription plus services revenue that we see as the best measure of growth on our P&L, increased by 37% year-over-year, up from 36% last quarter. As we look ahead, we remain optimistic about the business outlook as our new Dynatrace platform continues to be adopted by a growing number of new enterprise customers, and each quarter, we are proving our ability to expand rapidly within our growing customer base. This optimism is reflected in the increased top line guidance that Kevin will detail in a few minutes.
We're also proud that our rapid growth is complemented by strong operating margins. Not only did our top line results exceed our Q2 guidance, our bottom line delivered stronger-than-expected results as well. We run a very efficient business with gross margin at 83% and EBITDA at 25%. We continue to be cash flow positive on an operating basis while investing across the board in growth.
As we've said before, we believe in running a balanced business, a unique combination of growth and profitability at scale. We believe this balance, combined with our focus on investing aggressively in commercial expansion and continuous innovation, provides Dynatrace with attractive durability over the long term.
Let me now turn to 4 major advancements made in our fiscal Q2. New logo expansion; customer net expansion once they are on our new Dynatrace platform; continued progress moving Classic customers to Dynatrace; and finally, innovation and highlights around platform and TAM expansion. I'll take each of these in order, starting with business from new customers.
Once again, during the quarter, over 200 new customers have joined the Dynatrace platform family. We are now left to 1,828 customers on the new platform, an increase of 250 from a quarter ago, and more than double from a year ago. Consistent with prior quarters, a majority of these customers continue to be net new logos to our business. Nearly every new customer win is precipitated by the realization that their cloud program is disrupting their ability to keep up with the accelerating complexity of the ecosystem supporting their digital transformation. More and more running the business applications are being deployed into the enterprise cloud while visibility and situational awareness are declining. To regain control and bridge the complexity gap, more and more enterprises are finding us through word-of-mouth or via our frictionless free trial.
For example, a major insurer in the U.K. has been in the process of digital transformation. They are leveraging a multi-cloud environment that includes new go-to-market customer applications. After looking at a number of cloud monitoring solutions, the insurer selected Dynatrace as they've determined that it was the only platform that could show them the cost of outages in the context of application performance and how degradations and performance impacted their call center operations.
During their proof of concept, something we do with all new customers to demonstrate the Dynatrace difference, they discovered the power of Dynatrace's explainable AI engine, Davis, which continually learns what normal performance is, processing billions of dependencies in real time to serve up precise answers that were beyond their team's ability to quickly identify. Davis' ability to provide precise root cause problem identification for faster decision-making, greater optimization of IT resources and better business outcomes led to the selection of the Dynatrace software intelligence platform.
Once customers are on the new Dynatrace platform, we continue to see rapid expansion, which is evidenced by the rapid growth in our ARR that I referenced earlier. Once again, in Q2, our net expansion rate comfortably exceeded 120%. This is the sixth straight quarter we've exceeded this mark.
As we are still in the early innings of Dynatrace adoption, most of our expansion is driven by customers deploying our platform into new application stacks. The automatic continuous discovery and instrumentation, the automatic self-adjusting baselines, the automatic problem determination prioritized by business impact all contribute to rapid rollout and high value for low-effort economics our customers enjoy. This is something that we expect to continue benefiting from in the foreseeable future as we've barely scratched the surface of cloud application expansion.
In addition, we're also beginning to see increased adoption of additional platform modules as customers recognize the power of our broader platform capabilities.
Let me share an example of one of the many meaningful customer expansions during the quarter. A large U.S.-based consumer products company that completed a 7-figure expansion just 5 months after their initial land purchase of the Dynatrace platform. After a bad experience with their previous supplier, a gen 2 player who missed the market transition to the enterprise cloud, the company acquired its initial licenses for Dynatrace in the second quarter of this calendar year for an initial set of applications running in Azure. This first purchase was to prove the value they saw in Dynatrace in the proof of concept and to test our digital experience module for mobile and web use in production. Five months later, after a very successful initial rollout, the customer completed a 7-figure deal for our broader set of Tier 1 applications that included expanded use of our DEM module. Based on cloud optimization savings alone, the company calculated a payback for their Dynatrace investment of less than 6 months.
On the conversion front, the movement of our Classic APM customer base to the broader Dynatrace software intelligence platform, conversions continued to accelerate. Classic ARR has now declined to $94 million down $17 million from a quarter ago and now only represents 20% of total company ARR. As we've discussed, we started this conversion program in earnest 6 quarters ago with approximately $200 million in ARR to convert. We've been successful in moving our Classic customer base to the new Dynatrace platform because virtually every company has new enterprise cloud initiatives.
We are not simply upgrading from one product set to a new version. Our conversions typically involve a shift from legacy stacks to new stack cloud environments and a move from perpetual licensing to more predictable subscriptions. While it takes more time to find new stack buyers and transition licensing models, it yields a much more valuable customer in the strategic go-forward growth segment of their business, their enterprise cloud. We believe the added sales time and effort we've been spending on a near-term perspective is well worth it over the long term as we have transitioned our own business to drive sustainable growth and predictability.
As an example of a converting customer, this past quarter, a Fortune 100 brick-and-mortar retailer and customer of our Classic product set signed a mid-6-figure contract to convert to the Dynatrace software intelligence platform with plenty of opportunity to grow in the multiple 7 figures over time as they expand their cloud initiative.
Previously, the customer had a low urgency to change as our Classic offering was serving their needs well for current enterprise applications. But when new management came on board and prioritized digital transformation, their needs and urgency quickly changed. The company rapidly transitioned from third-party-developed applications run in a traditional data center to in-house-developed applications run in a new enterprise cloud. Dynatrace not only fit the new stack requirements perfectly, it proved invaluable to the company in getting up and running quickly and successfully across a very large hybrid e-commerce cloud environment at all layers of the stack: network, infrastructure, applications and user experience.
The Dynatrace platform's automatic install, self-learning baselining and in-product chat enabled the company to meet a tight time frame for implementation for its new applications and underlying enterprise cloud. This story and many more like it illustrate that as every company becomes a software company and transitions from old stack to new stack, the demand for Dynatrace to enable this transformation continues to grow.
We are very pleased that we are over halfway through the conversion process and believe we will substantially complete this process over the next 4 quarters.  This is particularly exciting for us for 2 reasons. First, we've proven our ability to expand rapidly with customers once they are on the broader Dynatrace platform. And second, we believe the completion of this process will further improve the productivity of our sales organization as the conversion distractions end and they can refocus on landing new customers and extending them across more applications and more use cases.
Let me finish by highlighting the expansion of our Dynatrace platform itself, which we believe will further improve our ability to win new customers, expand with existing customers and incent Classic customers to convert to Dynatrace.
Earlier this month, we announced an important new purpose-built module to the Dynatrace all-in-one platform, Digital Business Analytics. Monitoring cloud infrastructure and applications is not simply about metrics, logs and traces. It's about assuring better business outcomes by adopting measure by user experience, conversion rates, increased revenue or enhanced brand loyalty. With Digital Business Analytics, Dynatrace now connects best-in-class cloud infrastructure and application observability with key business analytic data such as conversion rates, revenue by product and geography, segmentation by channel, abandonment rates by page or path and more.
And with our powerful AI engine, Davis, at the core of our platform Dynatrace Digital Business Analytics instantly surfaces answers to degradations and anomalies with precise problem determination across the entire delivery chain so that human action can be taken rapidly to resolve issues before users and revenue are impacted.
A number of our early-adopter customers are using this functionality today, including fashion retailer outlets. They have publicly shared how they've been able to get real-time insights, and how business outcomes such as product in-cart, checkout review, and shipping and billing are impacted by application performance. Dynatrace provides answers to the underlying issues affecting user journeys, enabling them to optimize user experience and improve conversion rates. Don Hall, Talbots' manager of e-commerce support, summarized the outcome as, ""This has changed how we work, with our operations team now working closer with the merchandising team and other parts of the business to drive improved business outcomes.""
While others are still working to pull together full-stack observability, we delivered full-stack observability at enterprise scale 4 years ago and are moving ahead to higher levels of business value as we extend the capabilities of our software intelligence platform. We're excited about the initial reception to and adoption of this new business analytic module, and we plan to further build out a complete set of analytics and integrations with adjacent business analytics players over the next several quarters. Over time, we believe Digital Business Analytics will extend our total addressable market by several billion dollars as we enter the $24 billion analytics and business intelligence market as defined by Gartner.
In addition to adding new modules to the Dynatrace platform, we continue to extend existing platform capabilities as well. One of the most powerful brought to market in Q2 was a doubling of capacity of a Dynatrace cluster, which now scales to 50,000 hosts per cluster. And we also added support for the clustering of clusters, including cross-cluster distributed tracing or scalability without limits. Web-scale environments, which were a novelty just a couple of years ago, are becoming commonplace as enterprises shift from static on-premise data centers to dynamic multi-cloud architectures with highly distributed microservices workloads.
A number of our largest customers from financial services, health care, e-commerce and technology are enjoying rapidly scaling Dynatrace environments without compromising high-fidelity observability, smart automation and real-time intelligence. It really is a tribute to our world-class engineering led by Bernd Greifeneder, our CTO and Founder, and the next-generation architecture he and his key architects reimagined 5 years ago. And we continue to raise the bar for software intelligence at scale.
So in summary, our execution across our key performance indicators remain strong. We are consistently winning new cloud business against all competitors. We continue to build on our track record of rapidly expanding with customers once they are on the Dynatrace platform. We continue to run ahead of plan on moving Classic customers on to the Dynatrace platform. And as I just described, our innovation engine continues to deliver highly differentiated product value for our growing enterprise customer base.
Before I conclude, let me say that it's more than just great product and a rapidly-growing market that makes a sustainable world-class company. It's also the team you assemble around you. We've been blessed with the exceptional stewardship from Thoma Bravo. Your counsel, guidance and support have been invaluable to our success.
As we go forward, the role of outside counsel, guidance and governance will shift to independent board members. At time of IPO, we added 2 outside Board members, and Steve Lifshatz, CFO of Lytx, and prior to that, Fleetmatics; and Mike Capone, CEO of Qlik, both accomplished businessmen and directors. We also recently added Jill Ward to our Board. She serves on the board of HubSpot and served as a Director of Carbon Black and Adaptive Insights, among others.
I look forward to their ongoing contributions as we drive value and success for our customers, our shareholders and our employees.
With that, let me turn the call over to Kevin Burns for a review of our financials. Kevin? Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone.
I'll start by providing a more detailed review of our second quarter performance, and then I will finish with our outlook for the third quarter and increased full year guidance. Following my remarks, we will open the call for questions.
Our key financial metric focused on business momentum is annual recurring revenue. For the second quarter, ARR was $470.9 million, an increase of 44% year-over-year. The Dynatrace platform continues to increase as a percent of total ARR and was $376.8 million at the end of September, which was 80% of our total ARR. The remaining 20% of our ARR relates to our Classic offering. We continue to track very well here and expect to be substantially complete with moving our customers to our new platform in the next 4 quarters.
As you may recall, we started the conversion program with our sales organization 6 quarters ago, and to date, we have converted more than 50% of the Classic base. And we are actively working with the remaining customers on conversion programs and time lines. Overall, we have had a very good line of sight to completion, and we are very pleased with the success of the program and the benefits that have been realized by our customers once on the new platform.
Circling back to total ARR. There are 2 ARR growth drivers in our business. The first is new logo customers, and the second is our Dynatrace net expansion rate. If we quickly break down these 2 ARR growth drivers, during the quarter, we added 250 net new Dynatrace customers, ending the quarter with 1,828 Dynatrace customers. Consistent with recent quarters, net new customers were a healthy balance of adding new logos to the franchise as well as Classic customers moving to the Dynatrace platform. Over the last 12 months, 58% of our Dynatrace customer growth has been the result of new logos to the company.
In addition to a steady flow of net new customers, our Dynatrace dollar-based net expansion rate remained above the 120% threshold for the sixth consecutive quarter. We will continue to confirm this net expansion rate on a quarterly basis, and we plan to share this actual net extension value at the end of the fiscal year.
As a quick reminder, our ARR expansion is not a result of our customer base converting from Classic products with the Dynatrace platform as we do not charge a fee. Our ARR expansion is solely the result of footprint and product expansion in our customer base. We have been very focused on moving our customers to the Dynatrace platform because from there our customers can expand their use cases and footprint in ways that were not possible with our Classic products. As a result, all of our ARR expansion is either product expansion or adding new logos to the business.
Our current Dynatrace ARR per customer is north of $200,000, and we continue to believe that there's a large opportunity for further expansion in our existing customer base. Considering the fact that the majority of applications at our customers still lack instrumentation, we continue to expand our value proposition and use cases, as John discussed earlier, and our enterprise customers continue to expand their portfolio of cloud-based applications as they digitally transform their business.
Turning to revenue. Total revenue was $129.4 million, $5 million above the high end of our guidance and an increase of 27% on a year-over-year basis. This represented an increase from 25% growth last quarter and 17% growth in the previous quarter. The acceleration in total revenue growth is being driven by the strong growth in subscription revenue, which was $115.8 million in the second quarter, an increase of 41% year-over-year. For the quarter, as expected, Classic license revenue was down to $2.7 million and represented only 2% of our quarterly revenue as we wind these products down.
As John indicated, we believe the best measure and reflection of our ongoing revenue growth profile is the combination of subscription and services revenue which was $126.6 million in the quarter, representing 98% of total revenue and an increase of 37% on a year-over-year basis.
Before moving to our profit metrics, I would like to point out that I will be discussing non-GAAP results going forward, unless otherwise stated, and that our non-GAAP measures exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles and other items as outlined in the tables and in the press release.
Our non-GAAP gross margin was 82.5% for the second quarter, an improvement compared to 80.5% in the second quarter of fiscal '19. We are seeing a nice step-up in subscription gross margin percent where we are realizing the benefits of winding down the Classic stack and, more importantly, the benefits of the Dynatrace platform, which has 1 code base and over 90% of our customers on a version released within the last 30 days, an extremely efficient product. As a result of these changes, total gross margins have increased, as I just mentioned.
Our non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $29.4 million, above the high end of our guidance of $25 million, primarily related to the revenue and gross margin upside during the quarter. We also realized a modest upward expense leverage in the second quarter, and therefore, non-GAAP operating margin was 23%, up from 17% in the second quarter of '19. With that said, we remain focused on investing for long-term growth and plan to reinvest some of the revenue upside we expect for the full year back into the business which is reflected in our guidance.
Non-GAAP net income was $17.3 million and $0.06 per share. This was above our guidance of $0.04 per share. For the quarter, we had 270 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding.
Turning to our balance sheet. As of September 30, we had cash and cash equivalents of $211.7 million, and our long-term debt was $569.8 million. Our leverage ratio was 3.1x. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of $117.4 million. Since the end of the second quarter, we paid down $30 million of debt, and our current debt balance is $540 million. Going forward, the business will continue to naturally delever due to our healthy cash margins, and we expect to steadily pay down debt over time which we believe will continue to create value for our shareholders.
The last financial measure that I would like to discuss is remaining performance obligation, which at the end of the quarter was $653 million, an increase of 83% over Q2 of last year. The current portion of RPO, which we expect to recognize as revenue over the next 12 months, was $380.5 million, an increase of 70% year-over-year. Our healthy RPO expansion has benefited from our move to a subscription-based news combined with an increase in the duration of our new subscription agreement.
Finally, unlevered free cash flow for Q2 was $27.2 million, and it was $174.7 million on a trailing 12-month basis. As we've discussed, quarterly cash flows can vary due to seasonality, combined with the fact as we convert our customers from Classic to Dynatrace, can impact the timing of when we invoice our customers.
Before moving to guidance, I'd like to review a few items that impacted our GAAP results for the second quarter as previewed in our Q1 call. First of all, we incurred onetime fees of approximately $14.9 million primarily related to the IPO and mainframe spend as well as the minimal restructuring that hit the P&L in the second quarter.
Second, as a result of the spinoff of the mainframe business, we recorded a spin tax charge of approximately $256 million. In the second quarter, we paid approximately $254 million for federal and estate taxes, and we currently expect to pay the remaining spin tax obligation by early calendar '20.
Please keep in mind that we received $265 million from the mainframe business pre-IPO and that these funds are being used to pay the federal and state taxes related to the spin. As a result, we have removed the impact of the spin tax from our non-GAAP net income and unlevered free cash flow calculations.
Finally, we recorded stock comp expense in the quarter of $155 million, of which $145 million was a onetime mark-to-market stock comp charge related to the conversion of our preexisting equity awards at IPO.
Now let me turn to our guidance, which has been increased due to the strength of our second quarter results, combined with our continued positive outlook and the momentum of our business.
For the fiscal year, we are increasing ARR guidance to a range of $550 million to $555 million, representing year-over-year growth of 36% to 38%. Total revenue is now expected to be in a range of $533 million to $535 million, an increase from our prior guidance of $521 million to $524 million. We expect our non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $119 million to $121 million, up from our prior guidance of $112 million to $115 million. Non-GAAP net income per share is now expected to be in the range of $0.23 to $0.24 per share, assuming approximately 275 million weighted average diluted shares for the year.
For the third quarter, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $137 million to $138 million, representing year-over-year growth of 19% to 20%. It is worth pointing out that we expect the combination of subscription and services to grow over 30% in the third quarter. We expect third quarter non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $30 million to $31 million and non-GAAP EPS of $0.06 to $0.07 per share. This assumes approximately 282 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the third quarter.
In summary, we are very pleased with our second quarter performance and remain focused on building a strong track record as a public company. We believe Dynatrace's financial profile is highly unique, including meaningful scale, strong growth, healthy profitability and cash flow. With a large TAM in front of us and a market-leading position, we believe the company continues to be very well positioned.
With that, we will open the call for questions. Operator? [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. This is Matt on for Sterling. Congrats on the quarter. So the first question is just wanted to kind of get a sense of the traction that you're getting from customers that are buying those 3 main solutions of the APM infrastructure and logging. And the follow-up is just in regards to pricing structure in logging, how do you guys feel about that given where Datadog is and also, the changes being made at Splunk? Sure, Matt. So from a competitive landscape perspective, we haven't seen much change, honestly, since we last talked. The -- what we see in our world, as you know, we land with APM sort of as a core strength, the application, user experience segments. That serves us well. The market is in need of our kind of platform for dynamic web-scale workloads. And where we're seeing more and more customers hit what we call the microservices wall as we go forward where they have just classic tooling that just can't keep up with the scale or dynamism of those environments.
So our competitive position continues to be very strong. We continue to win against all competition in that area and as evidenced with the new logo growth as we go forward.
The other modules are what we've talked about is expand plays and the cross-selling into the infrastructure-only hosts, which we consider also part of logs going to that offering for us. That is starting to expand well. But most of our expansion, as I've said before, continues to come from just more Dynatrace into more application workloads -- cloud application workloads because they're so underpenetrated, it's a very straightforward expansion opportunity for us. So that continues to be the strongest.
Maybe the last thing I ought to say in the competitive landscape front is we really don't overlap, certainly not yet, with some of these other competitors coming out of the infrastructure space. They're still trying to bring together their observability solutions, something we've had for the last 4 years. And we continue to increase the value of our platform, driving better business outcomes with things like user experience capabilities, and as I noted in my comments earlier, Digital Business Analytics. And our next question will come from the line of Matt Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Congrats on the quarter. Certainly, seeing ARR accelerate at scale is impressive, and I think in your prepared remarks, you're clearly having success converting Classic customers. But I guess on the new customer front, can you talk about what percentage of those are greenfield wins versus competitive displacements? Sure. The -- in general, the greenfield is about 1/3 of what we see. We see more competitive displacements, whether that's actual head-to-head sort of bake-off with someone or we're replacing sort of a combination of tools in more of a do-it-yourself kind of set-up. So it's -- and that's been consistent for us over the last year, couple of years. That's great. And then seeing the net expansion north of 120% is great. And I guess I think on the roadshow, you guys talked about maybe 5% of the industries is currently monitoring their apps. Kind of I guess I'm wondering, when you look at some of your more sophisticated customers, do you have a sense for sort of what percentage of their apps are being monitored? Our best estimates are even at the high end, they're in the 20% to 30% range with the Dynatrace, but they all want to get to 50-plus. So there's plenty of headroom. And those at the very top end, most customers are really are in that 5%, probably on average, a growing number getting up to 10% because the expansion of our new platform is so easy. But still early days, and there's still a lot of headroom just on that application side before you even get to the cross-sell into additional ITOM use cases. Our next question will come from the line of Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. This is Caroline on for Heather. I was just curious about the retention rates of the customers that have been converting over to the new Dynatrace platform. Curious as to how that has been trending. And then also, are you seeing those customers add additional workloads as they convert over? So from a conversion standpoint, the new platform is extremely sticky. The use cases are wider. The value is quicker to realize. The connective tissue between sort of the infrastructure and application monitoring with driving better business outcomes is more clear and straightforward. So that's been -- it's been a great advantage to us as we move people across on to the Dynatrace platform.
The second part of the question? Second part is just in terms of the renewal rate, and I'll take it, Caroline. So if you look at where we've been, we've moved about $100 million off of the Classic stack over last 6 quarters of the member sales organization. That's translated at time of conversion to about $123 million on to the Dynatrace platform. So we're seeing those customers, when they move off of Classic, expand on to the Dynatrace platform. That's true foot for an expansion. Included in that math is churn -- is a little bit of churn. And I'd say, we're in line with sort of industry-standard churn rates. Your next question will come from the line of Jennifer Lowe of UBS. I wanted to go back to some of the earlier conversation in the prepared remarks about big digital transformation project as an opportunity for Dynatrace to come in and really help customers execute on their vision with moving applications into the cloud and then having the sophistication to manage and monitor those applications. And given that there's a lot of players usually involved in those types of digital transformation projects, be it SIs or hyperscalers or other platform solutions, I'd just be curious where in the process Dynatrace comes into those types of transactions. And are there any relationships that help you get in the door to discover where those opportunities exist? Sure. No -- good question. The -- sometimes, we do come in with system integrators. They are responsible sort of as the general contractor for a lot of the larger projects, and they look for the variety of pieces that they need in order to do a proper migration and then scale out of these enterprise clouds. So we have some very good relationships with the global SI base as well as regional cloud integrators that have sprung up around what is OpenShift or Cloud Foundry, AWS, Azure, et cetera. So that is an important part of our go-to-market portfolio, but we still find the majority of our opportunities through our direct sales organization.
And we -- as we talked about before, we target the global 15,000 enterprises. We're -- we now have about 1,800 of them penetrated, so a little over 10%. But still a lot of headroom to go. But it's the direct sales organization that finds the cloud architects and application architects coming in through, whether that's DevOps or the operations side of the business, and brings Dynatrace in usually at the time of scale-out of an enterprise cloud. Not when the first applications go into AWS or Azure, but when the company actually has a strategic initiative to build out a much -- a broader multi-cloud strategy. Your next question will come from the line of Bhavan Suri of William Blair. I wanted to touch first on the infrastructure monitoring SKU. Obviously, the end-to-end value proposition of the platform is obviously compelling, but there are some organizations that may want to start out using the infrastructure-only. You offer a separate SKU there, obviously. Can you talk about what level of interest you're seeing and uptake in the infrastructure-only SKU? And then I guess, in cases where you sold it, how successful have you been in migrating those guys up to the full platform? So Bhavan, the -- we rarely land with infrastructure-only. We use that to expand. The reason a customer -- first, the reason integrators or sales folks land, they will land in the application side -- full stack application side where folks have sort of a high pain. We have the industry-leading solution there. So it's pretty obvious that they're going to focus there first.
The reason people come to us for the infrastructure-only host extension is because once they get the hang of the value of our integrated AI engine, Davis, they realize that to see that live topology all at once and have it all sort of monitor 24x7 by an intelligent assistant, it makes their life so much easier across a much wider landscape.
So that's how we go-to-market today. Maybe that will change in the future, but I don't think that's dissimilar to some of our competitors, land in a position of strength and expand from there. Got it. That's helpful. Maybe touching on one other product, the DEM, obviously. You talked about the digital experience, seeing attach rates ticking up. I think we talked about it last quarter. I guess as you think about that, just an update on what you're seeing there as people have come back sort of out of DMPs, especially their transition to the cloud. So just trying to get some of the color on what you're seeing there, too. That's an interesting one as well. A couple of years ago, there was a low demand for digital experience as everybody were just standing up their clouds and they were spending more time just trying to figure out how to make the infrastructure itself work and try to get it in shape for business critical workloads. But now we see the workloads starting to hit the cloud platforms at an accelerated rate. And with this, the appreciation of understanding user experience has climbed dramatically. Our attach rate's up considerably over a year ago and the scale-out of the digital experience module continues to get great traction in our customer base.
I gave an example just a few minutes ago of 1 customer, but pretty much anyone who has some kind of an e-commerce or some kind of an important customer-facing application is a great candidate for extended DEM use from Dynatrace. That was really helpful. If I could squeeze one more product one in. You obviously announced a new product. I'm focusing on product just today, as you can tell, but the new Digital Business Analytics module obviously sounds really interesting. You've obviously had AI, but just, a, can you just talk a little bit about module, who you sell it to; and the pricing and interest from customers. Sure. So the -- currently, the folks -- the landing zone is really with the operations folks who want to connect with the digital business owners and provide more value and service to that group. Over time, as we build out the analytics and some of the integrations with some of the other business analytics tooling that the business folks use, we're hoping to actually break into the business budgets as well. And that's a key part of driving full TAM expansion in this area for us as we go forward.
The way we're pricing this module initially is through data ingestion. But over time, we'll expand that monetization opportunity, as I said, some additional analytics become available and some other pieces that we have on the road map to extend our functionality in this area to fit the business user needs.
As we just said -- let me just add real quick that this is a product extensionary that we've been eyeing for a while. We're really excited about it. Customers are excited about it because it gives them a direct connection between some of these sort of metrics and problem determination, items under the hood directly with business outcome metrics. And that connective tissue to be that tight is something that every customer looks for as they try to drive their digital business initiatives forward. Especially in real-time, yes, yes. Yes. Especially in real time, exactly. Our next question will come from the line of Richard Davis of Canaccord. Clearly, the analytics AI engine will sell because it has a name Davis, so we'll just leave it at that. I appreciate that part. So in any case, I've been talking to a bunch of investors lately. So one of the things that they get confused on is that sometimes they think Dynatrace and other firms like Google are kind of like an either/or decision. And in our field checks, at least what we found and I think you guys have said the same thing, is that this is not the case. And so could you kind of flesh out how like a Google Analytics and a Dynatrace are complementary not competitive? I'm just trying to help people understand the difference on that. Sure. Well, our business analytics are directly connected with performance, user experience, and connected all the way down into infrastructure and virtual network elements that may or may not be affecting performance issues. So what we do is we surface and connect this digital business data with that entire full-stack footprint. And nobody does that. Everybody sort of sits on the surface and sort of bubbles along, Google, Adobe, et cetera.
What I was alluding to as far as integrations with some of these other solutions that the business side of the house utilize day to day, I'm alluding to the sort of tighter integration with some of these other tools like a Google, where they're complementary with each other and brought together and connected, they can be a lot more powerful than each one sort of separate on their own. So that's still for us to do. But as you pointed out, we see them extremely complementary. No head-to-head overlaps there. Our next question will come from the line of Walter Pritchard of Citi. Wondering if you could help sort of quantify the order of magnitude increase when you're selling Business Analytics into a customer. Maybe not initial sale, but how do you see that opportunity progressing relative to what those customers who bought it, either DEM or ACM plus subscription on logging. Well, today, I would say that from the sort of -- if you're asking what's the order of magnitude of the monetization, I'd say that it's in the sort of a 10% of sort of host unit, maybe probably not $1 per $1 with DEM. DEM is sort of more pervasive and -- at the moment. But over time, it should be equivalent to what the DEM module brings, which is -- think of it as maybe $0.50 on the dollar of host units. So that's the way we think about it.
That's what we believe we can achieve as we build out the functionality in this area. The value is certainly extremely high when you can bring business metrics tied with performance and user experience together in real-time for digital business owners. So that's the way we see it today, and that's why I say over time, it's going to continue to scale out in monetization as we add additional value to the solution or to the module. Got it. Okay. And then let me just touch more kind of a question on -- you saw a nice uptick in new customers in the quarter versus last quarter and well above where you were in 4Q. Wondering if that incremental customer count was more attributable to the brand-new customers or the conversions. I think you mentioned pretty healthy new customer activity, but just curious if you can quantify that and especially in the context of the acceleration in customer adds. Yes. Well, so new customers, net new logos to the business continue to be the majority of the Dynatrace growth, quarter-over-quarter growth. And the stat that I think Kevin gave you, which is 58% -- over trailing 12 months, 58% of the new customers added to the Dynatrace platform, somewhere a little over 900 customers there, 58% have been new logos to the business.
So we have a healthy sort of new logo expansion going on in the company, and that's even with a little bit of distraction in our sales organization on the conversions, which we figure is taking about maybe 20% of their time right now until that's behind us. So healthy new logos, as you point out, and room to increase that rate as we free up the sales organization in 4 short quarters here. Your next question will come from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. This is Parthiv on for Brent. Just to follow-up on to Walter's question, the new platform customer uptake for the quarter, maybe -- is that maybe a new marketing motion or some sort of new initiative that maybe is yielding early results? Maybe a little bit more color there will be helpful. No. I don't think it's that. I think what we're seeing is -- are a couple of things. Obviously, we have an expanding sales organization, so that certainly helps. But what we're also seeing is that the gen 1 and gen 2 monitoring solutions are not just working okay in the dynamic clouds that are now sort of scaling out in production at enterprise level, they actually just don't work. And so customers are in a scramble. And I think it's what's creating the buzz around this concept of observability.
And we've been talking about the fact that the cloud will disrupt everything, and that's why we reinvented our platform for this moment. And we're starting to see it play out in growing scale. And it's -- we're sort of lining up with the scale on Kubernetes in some ways because of this. That's why we call it the microservices wall because that's what customers hit. So as that continues and that trend continues, I do think our new logo expansion to the franchise will continue to be robust. Okay, got it. And then good to see a strong net expansion, but I wanted to ask about the initial land motion. Maybe what are you seeing in terms of the number of APM hosts deployed on that initial land in the recent cohort of customers relative to what you saw in the past. The initial land is very consistent with where it's been, in the 90,000 to 100,000 initial land. I mean it's healthy versus a lot of competitors out there that land in very small mid-market footprints. But for us, and you start thinking into enterprise-class customer, that's a pretty modest bite to start with.
The exciting thing is that the -- while the land is nice, it's the expansion that has accelerated for us versus our Classic product world. And we're seeing that in the net expansion rates being healthy, and I believe we'll continue to see that over time as we get more comfortable and sort of the cross-selling of some of these other modules into the customer base. Your next question will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Congrats from me as well. A quick one. If you -- John, if you've -- like a lot of the questions on the call were obviously around like product and how -- observability because you have so many different players. But then you guys are just offering something that is very unique in the market because none of the other APM guys have really rewritten, and you guys are solving one of the most complex issues out there.
Where is -- the question is now like where are their customers in terms of understanding that in terms of like the microservices wall that you're talking about and that eventually a lot more stuff has to come to you. Are we still in the early innings of that, and hence, your confidence about just kind of growing the customer base coming your way? We are in the early innings. And it's as fast as we can get out there and have customers to suspend disbelief just long enough to believe that something else, something out there could actually do all this. And it's why we do a proof-of-concept with every customer. It's to show them, not just the Dynatrace advantage, but show them that it actually is true. So -- but it's a key part of our sales motion.
The other thing I just wanted to sort of point out here before the call is over is I know there's this talk about how suddenly competitive this space seems to be. I got to tell you that the monitoring space has had dozens and dozens of companies in it for decades now. It's always been a competitive space. It's just that you've sort of forgotten about the fact that they all got swallowed up a handful of big players and turned into sort of suites of tooling. But Dynatrace has competed in a noisy, competitive market for over a decade quite successfully and built a category leader because we think and build product differently. We don't just try to put more metrics out than somebody else. What we try to do is actually solve customer problems and help them drive better business outcomes.
So I think that you're right. We're in a good competitive position. We don't just do observability, we actually do automation and intelligence, which drive greater business value. And I'm really excited about where we are in a competitive position at the right time in the market as this transition to enterprise cloud and the dynamism of these orchestrated workloads -- microservices workloads really hit production at a high level. There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters. Yes. Well, thank you very much for your time this evening. I appreciate it, and I look forward to catching up in 90 days.
Thank you, everyone. Cheers. And this concludes today's conference call.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, John Van Siclen. John? Thanks, Michael. And I'd like to start by thanking all of you for joining us today. Once again we are very pleased with the company's quarterly performance, which resulted in third quarter financial results that were better than both our top line and bottom line guidance. I'm especially pleased that ARR once again increased by 44% year-on-year to $534 million, with our new Dynatrace platform now making up 87% of total ARR, up from 61% from a year ago.
Fuelled by the continued growth in ARR, our subscription plus services revenue what we see as the best measure of revenue growth on our P&L, increased by 36% year-over-year. As we look ahead, we remain optimistic about the business as our new Dynatrace platform continues to be adopted by a growing number of new enterprise cloud customers, and each quarter, we are proving our ability to expand rapidly within this growing customer base. Our optimism is reflected in the increased top line guidance that Kevin will detail in a few minutes.
We're also proud that our solid growth is complemented by strong operating margins. We run an efficient business with gross margin at 84% and a non-GAAP operating margin of 26% for the third quarter. We continue to be cash flow positive on an operating basis while investing across the board in growth.
As we've said before, we believe in running a balanced business, a powerful combination of growth and profitability at scale. We believe this balance, combined with our focus on investing aggressively in commercial expansion and continuous innovation provides Dynatrace with attractive durability over the long term.
Now let me turn to four major advancements made in our fiscal Q3. New logo expansion; customer net expansion once they are on our new Dynatrace platform; continued progress moving Classic customers to Dynatrace; and finally, innovation highlights around platform expansion and differentiation. I'll take each of these in order, starting with business from new customers.
This past quarter, we saw a sizeable uptick with new customers on the Dynatrace platform. 380 new customers joined the Dynatrace platform family in Q3, bringing our total Dynatrace platform customer account to 2208, nearly double from a year ago.
Q3 was a strong conversion quarter for us with twice as many customers converting as we converted a year ago. And even with this strong conversion uptick, half of the customer growth added to our Dynatrace platform came from customers that are new logos to the franchise. Nearly every new customer win whether net new or converted is participated by the realization that their cloud program is disrupting their ability to keep up with the accelerating complexity of the ecosystem supporting their digital transformation.
More and more run the business applications are being deployed into their enterprise cloud, while visibility and situational awareness are declining. To regain control and bridge the complexity gap, more and more enterprises are turning to Dynatrace.
For example, a large U.S. bank recently became a Dynatrace customer after concluding that its current APM solution could not keep up with the dynamic nature and scale of its micros services-based environment. Prior to Dynatrace, the bank experience successive service disruptions in applications running in their AWS Cloud which negatively impacted the bank's business and put their brand loyalty at risk.
Like most of our customers, the bank ran a trial Dynatrace to prove ease of use, scalability, and the value of our advanced automation. The bank was immediately impressed by the Davis AI engine at the core of our platform and its ability to automatically map the entire full stack topology of the hybrid cloud, and precisely identify problems and the root cause in real time right out of the box.
At the conclusion of their trial, the bank became a seven figure ARR customer with plenty of room for expansion over time. I should also mention that shortly after starting with Dynatrace the bank began to use our digital business analytics module announced in October to understand and reverse its drop-in conversion rates for bringing new customers to the bank.
This is a great example of the power of our all in one approach with intent to observe ability from user experience through infrastructure, putting business context to drive better digital business outcomes.
As we said, once customers are on the new Dynatrace platform, we see rapid expansion, which is evidenced by the solid growth in our ARR that I referenced earlier. Once again in Q3, our net expansion rate exceeded 120%. This is the seventh straight quarter we've exceeded this mark. As we are still in the early innings of Dynatrace adoption, most of our expansion is driven by customers deploying our platform into new applications stacks. The automatic continuous discovery and instrumentation, the self-adjusting baselines, the automatic problem determination prioritized by business impact, all contribute to rapid rollout and the high value for low effort economics our customers enjoy.
In addition, we are also beginning to see increased adoption of additional platform modules as customers recognize the power of our broader platform capabilities. Let me share an example of one of the many meaningful customer expansions during the quarter.
A U.S. based SaaS company to standardize on the Dynatrace platform and within two quarters completely replace their previous gen 2 supplier who missed the market transition to the enterprise cloud. Earlier this year, the SaaS company was struggling to effectively manage their four different data centres with their previous solution, and foresaw even greater issues with their evolution to [Indiscernible] orchestrated cloud.
After a successful trial last summer, the company decided to start by switching to Dynatrace in one of their data centers. Based on the rapid deployment of Dynatrace and success they achieved as a result of gaining real time answers and insights into performance degradations and anomalies, thanks to Davis. They decided to expand their Dynatrace footprint and make Dynatrace the company standard for both the remaining data center migrations as well as their upcoming move to a dynamic web scale cloud. This expansion came after only two quarters, from the initial land deal with Dynatrace.
Turning it to our continued progress on the conversion front, which is the movement of our Classic APM customer base to the broader Dynatrace software intelligence platform, Classic ARR has now declined to $69 million, that's down $25 million from a quarter ago, and now represents only 13% of total company ARR.
As we've discussed, we started this conversion program and then earned [Ph] seven quarters ago with approximately 200 million in ARR to convert. We've been successful in moving our Classic customer base to the new Dynatrace platform because virtually every company has new enterprise cloud initiatives. We're not simply upgrading from one product set to a new version. Our conversions typically involve a shift from legacy stacks, the new stack cloud environments.
While it takes more time to find new stack buyers, yields are much more valuable customer in the strategic go-forward growth segment of their business, their enterprise cloud. As an example of a converting customer this past quarter, a large U.S. based airline converted from our Classic tooling to the Dynatrace software intelligence platform. As the airline transformed from legacy systems to a modern multi cloud architecture, they realized that the disparate monitoring tools, both commercial and open source that they had acquired over the years were costing them precious time, money and resource. This led to excessive manual configuration, the need to stitch together data from multiple sources, and operating more rooms to get the answers they needed.
As part of an initiative to gain observability into their entire environment, including all airport terminal kiosks. The airline began a trial of the all-in-one Dynatrace software intelligence platform. Again, it was advanced automation and full stack observability at scale across a wide array of IaaS, tasks and container technologies they were the key factors in the successful displacement of competing tools.
Our all-in-one platform provides the airline both the modern observability it requires and the real time precise answers required to address degradations in performance, in business impacting anomalies.
After a successful trial, the airline converted from our Classic tooling to the new Dynatrace platform in the larger footprint led to an expanded seven figure ARR contract. We are excited to be well along the way with the conversion process and look forward to wrapping this up over the next few quarters.
As I've said before, this is particularly exciting for us for two reasons; First, we've proven our ability to expand rapidly with customers once they are on the broader Dynatrace platform. And second, we believe the completion of this process will further improve the productivity of our sales organization as a conversion distraction ends and they focus 100% of their efforts on landing new customers and expanding them across more applications and modules.
Let me finish by highlighting several of the innovations we announced recently, which we believe will further improve our ability to win new customers, expand with existing customers, and incent [ph] remaining Classic customers to convert to Dynatrace.
In early December, we announced the extension of our software intelligence platform to support AWS hybrid clouds provide seamless support across all AWS public regions and outposts. Due to regulatory or data security requirements, many enterprise customers want flexibility with regard to where their observability data resides.
With a flexible deployment model, Dynatrace offers a single platform built on cloud native architecture that seamlessly supports any configuration of AWS hybrid cloud environment, including both VMware Cloud on AWS Outposts and the AWS native variant of Outposts. Dynatrace AWS customers benefit from regular, automatic updates and automated administration of the Dynatrace platform while still meeting the strict governance, security and latency requirements of on-premises workloads.
This reduces the complexity, costs and risk associated with alternative cloud observability approaches that do not support the flexible deployment modes of AWS and the other major IAS [ph] and pass providers. During Q3, we also announced Keptn, an open source pluggable control plane to advance the industry's movement toward autonomous clouds. Keptn is an outcome of the knowledge and expertise gained as Dynatrace adopted a NoOps environment itself internally.
In talking with CIOs and CTOs of many of our enterprise customers, it's become clear that advanced levels of automation intelligence are required to bridge the growing gap between limited IT resources and the exponential increase in scale and complexity of dynamic enterprise clouds, and the growing cloud native workloads now being deployed.
We purpose built our new Dynatrace platform with a powerful explainable AI engine at the core to identify anomalies and degradations with precise root cause to trigger automatic self-healing actions. But what’s been missing has been a simple repeatable way to harness this potential and leverage it for a true NoOps approach.
Keptn provides the automation and orchestration of the processes and tools needed for continuous delivery and automated operations for cloud native environments. And we have a growing number of customers now engaged in leveraging Keptn and Dynatrace expertise to advance NoOps within their enterprise cloud environments.
Finally, just two to three weeks ago, we announced that we’d been collaborating with Google, Microsoft and other industry leaders on the open telemetry project to shape the future of open standard base observability. Having been a leader in distributed transaction tracing at scale for years, Dynatrace is contributing knowhow and manpower in this area to the project, as OpenTelemetry gains momentum open tell data will serve as an additional data source that further extends the breadth of our cloud observed ability, which in turn feeds Davis our AI-engine providing our customers with richer insights and automatic actions, across a wider landscape as dynamic multi clouds continue to evolve in scale. We see this open-source standard as a benefit to the market and another potential accelerant to the adoption and expansion of Dynatrace.
In summary, our innovation engine continues to differentiate our solutions and expand our market opportunity. Our Dynatrace customer base continues to increase as dynamic multi clouds and workloads expand and scale. New logos are being added, and existing customers are converting and expanding on the new platform, both at a healthy pace. And our execution across our key performance indicators remain strong.
With that, let me turn the call over to Kevin Burns for a deeper review of our financials. Kevin? Thank you, John and good morning everyone. I'll start by providing a more detailed review of our third quarter performance and I will finish with our outlook for the fourth quarter, and our increased full year guidance. Following my remarks, we will open the call for questions.
Our key financial metric focused on business momentum is annual recurring revenue. As John said, ARR was $534.5 million at the end of the third quarter, an increase of 44% or $162 million compared to the year ago period.
Of the 44% growth year-over-year 5 percentage points of the annual growth was due to customer expansion at the time our customers converted from our Classic product to Dynatrace and the balance of 39 percentage points of growth came from new logos and expansion in our customer base on the Dynatrace platform.
As a reference point, this compares to 44% growth last quarter on a year-over-year basis of which six percentage points of growth was due to expansion at the time of conversion and 38 percentage points from new logo and Dynatrace platform expansion.
The Dynatrace platform continues to increase as a percent of total ARR and was approximately $466 million at the end of December or 87% of our total ARR. The remaining 13% of our ARR relates to our Classic offerings.
This compares to a mix of 80% Dynatrace and 20% Classic at the end of the last quarter. We continue to track the plan on conversions and expect to be substantially complete with moving our customers to our new platform over the next three quarters.
As you may recall, we started the conversion program with our sales organisation seven quarters ago, and todate we have converted nearly two-thirds of the Classic base. We are actively working with the remaining customers on conversion time lines and continue to have a very good line of sight to completion.
We are very pleased with the success of the program and the benefits that have been realized by our customers once they are on our new platform. By the end of our fiscal Q4, we expect Classic ARR will be below 10% of total ARR marking a major milestone for the company.
Circling back to total ARR. There are two ARR growth drivers in our business. The first is new logo customers, and the second is our Dynatrace net expansion rate. If we quickly break down these two growth drivers, during the quarter, we added 380 net new Dynatrace customers, ending the quarter with a little over 2200 Dynatrace customers. Consistent with recent quarters, new customers were a healthy balance of adding new logos to the franchise as well as Classic customers moving to the Dynatrace platform.
Over the last 12 months, 54% of our Dynatrace customer account growth has been the result of new logos to the company. In addition to a steady flow of net new customers, our Dynatrace net expansion rate remained at or above the 120% threshold for the seventh consecutive quarter.
As a quick reminder, our ARR growth is not a result of our customer base converting from Classic products to the Dynatrace platform as we do not charge a conversion fee. Our ARR expansion is driven primarily by footprint and product expansion in our customer base. We have been very focused on moving our customers to the Dynatrace platform because from there our customers can expand their use cases and footprint in ways that were not possible with our Classic products.
As noted earlier, only 5 percentage points of our 44% ARR growth occurred at the time of conversion and in our view even those 5 percentage points are through customer expansion.
Our current Dynatrace ARR per customer remains north of $200,000 for the fourth consecutive quarter and we continue to believe that there's a large opportunity for further expansion in our existing customer base.
The majority of our applications that our customers still lack instrumentation, we continue to expand our value proposition and use cases, and our enterprise customers continue to expand their portfolio of cloud-based applications as they digitally transform their business.
Let’s now turn to revenue. Total revenue was $143.3 million, $5.3 million above the high end of our guidance and an increase of 25% on a year-over-year basis. Total revenue growth was driven by strong growth in subscription revenue, which was $128.5 million in the third quarter, an increase of 40% year-over-year.
For the quarter, Classic license revenue was $3.9 million down from $12.1 million in the year ago period.
As John indicated from a P&L perspective, we believe the best measure and reflection of our ongoing revenue growth profile is the combination of subscription and services revenue, which was $139.4 million in the quarter, representing 97% of total revenue and an increase of 36% on a year-over-year basis.
Before moving to our profitability metrics. I would like to point out that I will be discussing non-GAAP results going forward as outlined in the tables in the earnings press release. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 84% for the third quarter, an increase from 82% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. We continue to see a healthy increase in our subscription gross margin percentage as we realize the benefits of winding down the Classic product stack, and more importantly, the benefits of the Dynatrace platform, which has one code base in over 90% of our customers on a version released within the last 30 days, an extremely efficient product.
Our non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter was $37.5 million well above the high end of our guidance of $31 million due to a combination of revenue and associated gross margin upside, and to a much the smaller extent some investments that moved to the fourth quarter.
This led to a non-GAAP operating margin of 26%, up from 21% in the third quarter of 2019. We are very pleased with the strong profitability performance for the quarter. However, as discussed before, we remain focused on investing for long-term growth and plan to reinvest some of the upside we realize during the quarter back into the business, which is reflected in our Q4 and full year guidance.
Non-GAAP net income was $26.7 million or $0.10 per share. This with about our guidance is $0.6 to $0.07 per share. For the quarter, we had $280.2 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding.
Turning to the balance sheet, as of December 31 we had cash and cash equivalents of $189 million and our long-term debt was $549 after taking into account a $30 million principal payment in Q3.
Our leverage ratio was 2.7 times, our trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA of $139, this is down from a leverage ratio of 8.9 times at quarter end prior to our IPO. Keeping in line with our program to consistently reduce debt, we made another debt payment of $30 million in January and our gross debt is now approximately $510 million.
While on the debt topic, I would like to let you know that later today we plan to launch a repricing of our debt facility. We anticipate that there will be some modest cost in the fourth quarter and our guidance excludes any potential impact.
During fiscal 2021, we expect to realize a modest benefit related to reducing our interest expense. But it is not material to our overall results and we will provide more color on next quarter's call.
Moving back for key metrics, unlevered free cash flow for Q3 was $13.3 million and it was $161.9 million or 32% of revenue on a trailing 12-month basis. As we've discussed quarterly cash flows can vary due to seasonality combined with the fact that as we convert our customers from Classic to Dynatrace, that can impact the timing of when we invoice our customers.
The last financial measure that I would like to discuss is our remaining performance obligation, which at the end of the quarter was $800 million, an increase of 74% over Q3 of last year. The current portion of RPO which we expect to recognize as revenue over the next 12 months was $456 million, an increase of 66% year-over-year.
Our healthy RPO expansion has benefited from our move toward subscription business combined with an increase in the duration of our new subscription agreements. We have consistently stated that we do not view calculated billings as a meaningful business metric in the near-term, mainly due to variability created by the timing of our customer conversions and our ongoing shift from perpetual license to a subscription offering.
We are very pleased with the success that we've had in moving our business to a subscription model. This shift has no impact on ARR and it actually has a positive impact of the long-term given its a renewable source.
Keep in mind however, that the shift subscription has and will continue to put pressure on our long-term deferred revenue balance as annual invoicing for subscription is lower than the upfront invoicing for perpetual licenses that are recognized over three years.
Moreover, the shift subscription has happened even faster than expected this year which we believe is a great thing for our business. Its for these reasons that we are focused on our ARR from the time of our IPO as we believe it is the most relevant leading indicator of our business momentum and will continue to be the case until we complete our revenue model transition.
Now, let me cover our guidance which has increased due to the strength of our third quarter results combined with our continued positive outlook and the momentum of our business.
For the fiscal year we are increasing ARR guidance to a range of $563 to $566 million representing year-over-year growth of 40%, an increase from our prior guidance of $550 to $555 million.
Total revenue is now expected to be in a range of $542.2 million to $543.2 million, an increase from our prior guidance of $533 million to $535 million. We expect our non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $127.5 million to $128.5 million, up from our prior guidance of $119 million to $121 million, representing the non-GAAP operating margin of 24% at the midpoint of the range.
Non-GAAP net income per share is now expected to be $0.28 per share assuming approximately 272 million weighted average diluted shares for the year. For the fourth quarter, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $147 million to $148 million representing year-over-year growth of 27%.
It is worth pointing now that we expect combination of subscription and services to once again grow over 30% in the fourth quarter. We expect fourth quarter non-GAAP op income to be in the range of $33.5 million to $34.5 million and non-GAAP EPS of $0.08 per share assuming $284 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the fourth quarter.
In summary, we are very pleased with our third quarter performance and our optimism about the future is reflected in our increased guidance for the year. With a large and growing TAM in front of us and a market-leading position, we believe that Dynatrace is well-positioned for the long-term.
Most important for shareholders is that we continued to show a financial profile that we believe is highly unique including meaningful scale, strong growth, healthy profitability and cash flow.
With that, we will open up the call for questions. Operator? [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Hey, guys. This is Matt on Sterling. Thanks for taking my question. So looking at the significant upside in ARR versus what you did in subscription revenue. Wondering, if you could comment on the linearity in bookings during the quarter? Thanks. Hi, Matt. Thanks for the question. So we obviously attract linearity on a monthly basis. What I will say is for our December calendar year-end quarter, we typically see a moderate percentage of our bookings come in that month three. So yes, it is little bit higher in this quarter, but it consistent sort of with the last few years in terms of linearity. So no real outliers in terms of the flow of the [Indiscernible]. Great. Thanks guys. Your next question comes from the line Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Great quarter. In addition to the 44% ARR growth, new customer adds, it was really impressive to us. And I think you added 130 more than you did in the year-ago quarter as well as last quarter. Can you talk in a bit more detail of why new customer adds were so strong? Has something changed competitively? Perhaps could there be some acceleration in competitive replacements? Hey, Matt. So couple of things. First of all, it was a big conversion quarter. And we've said that we been stimulating the base now for a while and we're seven quarters into the program. And the end of the year its always a forcing function for many things, and this just happened to be a big quarter for moving the base over to Dynatrace. So that's a big part of it. But even with that about half of that growth is still net new logos to the franchise. And that's really coming because the market is now moving much more aggressively to multi cloud environment sort of web scale environment including the modern workloads, microservice base workloads and Kubernetes orchestrated environment and really leave the gen 1 and gen 2 tooling behind. And so our reinvention five or six years ago is now really playing well in the market and so there is a competitive tailwind for us as well. That's great. And then maybe when you look at your customer base, John, can you estimate what percentage of say an average customers are monitoring cloud based app or infrastructure versus say an on-premise app or infrastructure? And how do you think that differs versus in sort of the broader competitive landscape? So, from our standpoint, I mean, we've done a little bit of work working back into it and its about -- its in that 70% to 75% range our modern cloud workloads and modern cloud environments that the new platform is monitoring. And the way we go to market is we look for those modern cloud teams and stacks. And then as they get hang and how Dynatrace works in the automation and intelligence build in creating much greater efficiency for their sort of limited IT resources, they start bringing it back, further get back into their sort of legacy of Classic environments.
But its actually and that's a pretty high ratio and I'd say, obviously, relative to a Gen 1 or Gen 2 kind of tooling out there, it's much more into the modern cloud environments. So we think it’s a good spot to be. I think over time we'll see that percentage continue to climb because we are uniquely positioned in those environments. Great color. Well done guys. Thanks you. Your next question comes from the line Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Great. Thank you very much. I mean, obviously you guys are doing a great job converting the installed base. And I know you mentioned that you look to be done with the conversion over the next couple of quarters. And you've had some very good success on new customer lands. But can give us a sense -- you made a comment on the call that, I mean, getting the sales people, not focused on conversions and focusing on new land will help improve productivity. Are there any changes to be incentives that you're paying the sales force as you move towards the next fiscal year and the conversions become even smaller?
And I guess the second part would be when you're going after new customers, how do the size of those initial lands compared to the size of the initial conversion deal? I know you don't change for the conversion, but kind of what you're getting from those when they convert in terms of the uplift. So sorry for complicated question, but any thoughts would be very helpful? Yes. So, first of all, we haven't set our sales plan for the following year. That's in discussion now. Our approach has been to try to move as much of the base across the line, convert it by the end of this fiscal year, so that we can free up sales and rework the sales incentive plan, so that they focus 100% of their time on new logo opportunities and expansion of the base, especially cross-selling some of the new modules. It’s the base. So that's still our program. We still have to work through some of the details, but those are our thoughts at this time.
Relative to a land versus expand the deal, the land deals have been very consistent in 95K kind of range. I think if you look, we've been talking about 92K to 100K sort of in that or 92K to 97K sort of in that range for the last three quarters. So that's very consistent. And the expansion deals, they vary a little bit by time of year. Q3 happens to be a very strong expansion quarter and so does Q4. So that those times of the year, the expansion deals can be track a little bit larger on an ASP basis and then they come down to a little more of a run rate range in Q1 and Q2 for in the fiscal year. Overall, there is not a huge difference between the two. We're a transaction-oriented business. We're not a big deal oriented business. And I think that that helps us to manage a more effective business over the long term. Great. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please go ahead. Hi. Thanks for the question. For John, and one for Kevin. For John just looking at the expansion that you've seen, I'm curious product wise, getting into things like digital experience, monitoring infrastructure, monitoring versus just app expansion into new apps. What's been -- has there been a trend there in terms of product versus sort of footprint expansion as you've continue to put up that ARR [ph] number? So, we're still -- I feel like we're still in the early innings of cross-selling. Most of that expansion still comes from more applications being instrumented, mainly because we have such a highly automated way of instrumentation sort of a self discovery, very automatic products and about a 5% of that at range. We are well over that with the majority of our customers. But we are seeing an uptick in the cross-sell as we start to focus on a little bit more. Digital experience is one that we're pretty used to positioning. So that one right now runs a little bit ahead. But we're seeing a nice uptick in the infrastructure side as well.
I think that that's really driven by the fact that folks have realized that all that old tooling really falls away when you get to dynamic enterprise cloud. So with those we have a lot of optimism in our ability to scale that out as we go into next year. And that's one of the things we're going to focus on as we sort of wind down conversions and wind up cross-selling as we go into our fiscal 2021. And Kevin, can you just talked about on the investment side, especially as we look into 2021 sort of where in Q4 in particular you're investing in the business? And then how that pertains to -- how you're thinking about investing in 2021? Yes. I think that its status quo. When I say status quo, it's continued focus on innovation, right, building out on our R&D organization so we can maintain our lead from a competitive product standpoint. We've maintained that very well over last couple of years. And that's one area of investment that we will continue. And the second big area of investment will -- again, will be continued investments in commercial expansion a lot as well as some marketing programs. So these are two things that we've been doing very well over the last couple of quarters really the last year. And you'll see a little bit more of that here in Q4 and that trend should continue as we try to continue to grow this business at a really nice fit. Great. Thanks for the color. Your next question comes from the line of Bhavan Suri with William Blair & Company. Please go ahead. Hey, good morning. This David Griffin on for Bhavan. Thanks for taking the questions. Two if I could. First, just so last quarter you called out pretty encouraging early interest in the new digital business analytics module. I was wondering if you could just give us an update on the level of interest that you're seeing from customers there? And maybe just talk a little bit about how the early partnership conversations with the traditional BI vendors are progressing? Sure. Well, it's still early. It takes a sales organization, direct sales organization a while to pick up sort of new capabilities and introduce them to their accounts, the accounts trial and then start to adopt. But I did talk about one of the customers in my prepared remarks about one that sort of picked it up right away. They were having conversion challenges with some of the new applications and bringing new customers online at the bank and it fell right in place for them. It was timely announcement, it was something they needed and dropped right in.
So those kinds of examples sort of find their way through the sales organization. I expect over time that the business analytics are going to become a really key piece of our go forward dialog with customers and opportunity in the market. So I'm pleased with where we are right now, but it is early innings of course. As far as how this works with some of the other analytics players in the market mainly those that focus on digital business teams as opposed to the operations teams. We're seeing that the relationships really are driving the opportunity. But the fact that we complement those other analytic tools are out there like let's say in Adobe Analytics, and be able to light up the entire tech stack underneath some of these environments.
So it's not just about what's happening with conversion rates, what's happening with revenue. Why is there a drop off or why can't we -- what do we need to do to optimize? We provide the visibility back into the stack as to exactly what to do, to attack some of these things. So it's a great addition for the folks that use those kinds of analytics tools to be able to team with the development teams and their operation teams much more effectively to optimize their digital go-to-market. Got it. That's helpful. And then, I want to talk about one other recent announcement. So in December you announced new autonomous cloud enablement practice that I guess, the goal is to provide things like best practices, hands on expertise and automation services to help customers, kind of make the transition of autonomous cloud operations which certainly sounds interesting in an area of need. Can you talk in a little bit more detail just about the practice kind of how that's different from what you've been doing on the services side previously? And then maybe whether there are any margin implications associated with that? Sure. The focus of our service organization is always making sure that customers get the most out of our software platform. As a -- customers will tell you and I believe as well, nobody really wants to buy software. They're trying to solve the problem or they're trying to get sort of some kind of a lead in the market. And our services organization has been fantastic in helping customers drive adoption, explore new cases et cetera. With this new announcement and this new practice, what we want to do is be sort of a little bit more proactive and help customers do what we've done ourselves, which has moved their sort of reactive I.T. organizations, reactive to issues knowing to a proactive highly automatic or automated state.
And so this practice is led by a team that's been very close to some of the work we've done with our open source control plane, Captain, and the thinking behind that. And they're now taking that to a number of customers who been asking us for more and more best practices and expertise in this area. And so rather than just try to coach them along the way, we're actually building out program to help them and then help enable them and help do some of the work for them to make sure that they can accelerate their directions and their drive towards cloud which is really an inevitable place for every customer building webscale clouds.
Nobody really wants to have lots of humans running around, trying to manage them and deal with them and optimize them and deal with the issues of them. So, we're just at the front end -- front edge of the spear on that one for the marketplace. Its a great place for us to be. And we have a great platform to enable it. Great. That's helpful. Thank you for taking the questions and congrats on a solid quarter. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Richard Davis with Canaccord. Please go ahead. Hey guys. This is Luke on for Richard. So, we've been talking with the number of interesting vendors in the DevOps space. And it seems like they've finally gained some mainstream momentum. Our question for you guys would be, how do you guys think about the space? And do you envision extending into that ecosystem presumably on the op side of things? Thanks. Sure. Well, we already are in the DevOps world. We've always in a thought of performance and cloud application, optimization and something that needs to go upstream, continuous development -- sorry, continuous deployment all the way back into continuous integration. So we already do this. And that's the value we provide in those environments are fairly straightforward. People have lots of capabilities to drive new function, but very few capabilities to make sure that they have their architectures maintained and the ability to scale is built into the continuous integration, continuous deployment models.
And as we see more and more from a dev standpoint wanting to understand what their new code is doing in production. So visibility actually into sort of the early production releases whether they're canary releases or A/B testing and that kind of thing. We see even a broader opportunity to be able to help those DevOps teams optimize code, drive better quality in those early stages prior to when things get out into production.
The last thing I'll say about it our autonomous cloud program actually starts with something we call unbreakable pipelines. And we start there because it's more straightforward with the devs to put all this together with the open source pluggable back plan that we built in Captain. And so we'll be bringing even more sort to focus to the DevOps side of things know as we go forward. That's very helpful. Thanks. Your next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe with UBS. Please go ahead. Great. Good morning. First question for me. So, the commentary around the improvement in conversion was I thought particularly interesting. And I wanted to pass through that a little bit more. Can you talk about how much of that was a function of market i.e. as companies move to seize more complex environments, it's just a more pressing issue to modernize our APM and observability practices versus things that maybe you were doing differently from a sales process perspective versus anything you're seeing differently from a competitive perspective where maybe your win rates are a bit better in the quarter than they've been. If you could just sort of give a little more granularity that be awesome? So, I don't think it's anything that we're doing differently. It's just a culmination of a lot of work we've done over the last six, seven quarters. It takes customers a little while to digest something that's new. We're not doing a like-for-like this product for that product kind of a thing we're actually taking multiple tools and we're now providing a platform. And multiple tools are all targeted into ATM for old stack environments or sort of classic stack environments, and the new platform is targeted at new stack cloud environments, which means sort of a new buyer.
So, it takes a while. It's a sales process. As I've said, we believe that it's worth all the effort. It's going to pay off because we're now in the mainstream go forward part of all these customers businesses, their enterprise clouds. And this just happened to be a quarter that sort of culminated into a lot of things happening at once, which is great. I think it's a peak quarter for us. The next three quarters will be strong, but not as not as large as this past one. But I think it's just a culmination of a number of things that we've been doing well. And customers as you said, started realizing that the enterprise cloud is a growing part of their portfolios and will become the lion share of their IP portfolios here over the next 12 to 24 months. Okay. And maybe just to follow-up on that. So if we look at pipelines versus conversions, is it reasonable to think that the pipeline trajectory has been more steady and now the delta is really just converting on that pipeline more effectively or you seeing pipelines expand as well? We're seeing both pipelines expand as well as conversions remaining strong across the board. So that said, both bode well. Plus, as Kevin's pointed out a couple of times, we've been expanding our sales organization as well. So we're on track for that 25% increase in our sales rep capacity this year and look forward to as they ramp in, they're having some impact and they'll have greater impact as they mature. Great. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO. Please go ahead. Hi. Thank you very much. I had two questions as well. The first is relates to an earlier question. But as you look out and you see your conversion of legacy being zero or close to zero, does that help hurt or neutral to your ARR growth? It's a great question and as a sort of you need a perfect crystal ball to answer it. So three quarters from now we'll be able to have that a little bit of hindsight. But the way we look at it is this. It's great that we're shifting a customer base across. But it's taking a fair amount of sales bandwidth to do it. Because as I said, it's really like a new sale, because we don't just talk to the team that had our old tooling. We have to find a whole new team on the other side and make sure that they find the value of Dynatrace for their cloud programs.
So we estimate that's anywhere from 20% to sales effort maybe a little bit higher given various quarters like this past quarter. But going forward when the conversions run off and we have 100% sales focus and the full capacity of the sales organization focused on new logos and expansion that should give us sort of a tailwind from a productivity standpoint in that regard. So how neutral does that -- do those two sides of the equation work? Time will tell. But we think it will be relatively neutral. And one other comment, just to add on that. If you look at our ARR growth over the last twelve months, as we mentioned, it grew 44%, five percentage points of that growth came at the time of a customers is converting. So time of conversion they're expanding their footprint. Now that -- if you look at that on a net expansion rate, that is below 120% net expansion rate for that customer base when they're moving. So, we always talk about Dynatrace as being north of 20%. So you can argue or think that once they are on that new platform we do believe that they will expand in a much more rapid pace on Dynatrace. Okay. Thank you for that. My follow-up question relates to as your expansion capabilities or I shouldn't say, your expansion, your portfolio within the context of APM continues to improve. So the pipeline as you mentioned is getting richer. Your conversion rates are good. But are you seeing any different changes in attach rates to the infrastructure side? From a standpoint of cross-selling and what we consider expansion. As we've said before we land from a position of strength as you would expect in our swim lane, which is the application performance monitoring focused on the cloud workloads. The expansion is increasing, the attach rate of infrastructure, as well as digital experience are increasing. It's not something that we disclose at the moment. But what does that look like as far as portfolio of emerging products relative to the APM module itself. But going forward, we're looking at when and how we do that. Maybe at the end of our fiscal year beginning of the coming fiscal year. Right. Many thanks. That's it for me. Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please go ahead. Hey. Thanks for taking my question. More on the bigger picture one. Can you talk about like OpenTelemetry, is that kind of coursed out, more and more vendors are doing it, but then some of the Gen 2 guys are not kind of very openly around that. How does that help you in terms of being out in the market with a more modern solution? It's a great question. You know, OpenTelemetry is a great standard. It's why we've gotten involved in it with Google, Microsoft and some of the other industry leaders. Because we've always thought that gathering data is not really where the differentiation or values going to come in. This is why when we built, rebuilt our platform, we thought about it with advanced automation and an AI engine at the core, because that's where we really see the advancements and the opportunity to drive value.
That's where it's more about what you do with the data. And it is about gathering it. OpenTel allows us to gather data over a much wider sets of environments, server-less environments, mesh environments, a number of different areas that are just very hard to figure out how you might instrument or self-discover that. And so it enables a big footprint, means, that you're going to need a highly scalable engine that can process and analyze lots of data to make sense of it to allow sort of the IT teams, the limited IT teams to do more and more as these environments get much larger and more complex. So we see it as a great opportunity to sort of shine the light on our automation and intelligence differentiation, and we think it's going to be a great sort of tailwind for us as we go forward in the business. Okay. Thank you. Then one quick one for Kevin. Can you just remind us on kind of you'd mentioned the debt situation on the prepared remarks? What's the ultimate -- what's your long-term target around debt leverage et cetera? Thank you. And well done. Yes. As I mentioned on the call, the net leverage trailing 12 is 2.7 times EBITDA. The way we're trying to manage this is, we're trying to maintain cash around $150 million to $200 million mark, which means we're going to be paying down on a quarterly basis any excess cash or using excess cash to make that payment. So in January we paid down $30 million. Obviously given our cash generating capabilities, we can reduce this $500 million of debt over the next couple of years very nicely. So we're going to continue to pay down consistently on a quarterly basis going forward as we have done over the last three quarters as a public company. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Hey guys. Thanks. This is Parthiv on for Brent. Just a follow-up on the net new adds this quarter. The half of net adds that were new to the franchise. Anything you'd call it from a vertical or geo perspective relative to past quarters? So nothing unusual on any of those fronts really. The digital transformation is really across all industries. So there's really no, nothing I could point to that says this industry is all of a sudden accelerating and this one is decelerating or there's some shift. And the same thing from a geographic basis. I mean even the world sort of flattened these days, it used to be -- in Asia Pacific you might think of as two years behind the U.S. or something. It's a much more level now. So there's no real shifts in geographic mix. I wouldn't say there's any shift in industries. It just more a mass movement of digital transformation and the realization that it's going to be cloud first. And that the clouds are no longer sort of static or exploratory. They really are enterprise class, multi-cloud, dynamic workloads. I mean where we're hitting that, a sophistication level and scale level that we anticipated five or six years ago. But it's really starting to hit the mainstream, the enterprise market now which I think again gives us a little bit of tailwind going forward. Yes. Makes sense. Okay. And as a follow-up, just when you look at the AWS integration that you guys have just done. How would you guys measure the opportunity for host expansion with that integration over time relative to what you're seeing up in the hybrid cloud versus what you've seen on traditional on-prem environments? Sure. So the AWS move to outposts. Its an interesting move, because it was a religion two, three years ago that everything was going come to public clouds. And it's a bit of a realization that hybrid environments can be around for a pretty long time. We built a unique SaaS platform that allows us to run the same software cluster technology whether it's in the cloud or whether it's behind people's firewalls. That's same code basis, as Kevin has pointed out a number of times, but we're able to use that exact same software to handle sort of both workload environments or both at the same time for hybrid cloud customers.
The fact that AWS is now distributed their cloud, so that you can actually run Outpost behind the firewall, aligns with the model we've had for the last four years in enterprise sort of volume production. So it's perfect for us and it's very hard for somebody when the SaaS only platform to be able to cover all the workloads because of regulatory issues, because the data sovereignty or data security issues. And so, when we look at and we think of our TAM as the full TAM of enterprise customers and their workloads as opposed to only the ones that allow for telemetry data to go into a cloud.
So we think the move from -- with AWS is actually can accelerate sort of our penetration into the AWS enterprise portfolio. It's early days, but we think it's a great move and we're well positioned to take advantage of that like whether it's AWS variant or whether its the VMware variant. Got it. That's helpful. Thanks guys and congrats. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Sarah Hindlian with Macquarie. Please go ahead. Yes. Hi. Congratulations of the great quarter. Just a quick question for you following up actually on a few of my peers. The international opportunity as you discussed, it sounds like there's still plenty of room for you guys to go there. So, my first question is really how are you thinking about expanding in the international especially with the growth in headcount you just mentioned? So, we've always had a very strong international presence in our businesses is 60% -- 55% to 60% North America and the balance, international. And we've had that footprint for quite a while. So one of the advantages for us is we don't have to build out that sales support, marketing infrastructure on a global basis. We already have it. So when we talk about sales rep expansion, we think about it as pretty much. Although there's a little bit more in North America since that's the front end of the enterprise cloud. But in general, you can think about it as when we say 25%, we mean, 25% pretty much in each of the four major geographies we think about. We think about North America. We think about EMEA, okay, which is Europe, Middle East and Africa. We think of Latin America and then we think of Asia-Pac. So, from that standpoint think about that as we expand them all sort of relatively similarly. And they all have a fantastic opportunity for us, and we're doing well in almost two geographic sectors. Okay. Thank you very much. That was really helpful. And as a follow-up I was wondering, if maybe you're seeing a shift, I mean, you're seeing a lot more protection of cloud native as you're moving along. But is there any way you can help us to kind of think about the magnitude of shifts you're seeing from on-premise to protecting cloud applications of any kind? So we don't really think about it as there's the shift from on-premise to cloud. We think about it as a shift from monolithic to cloud or cloud native environments, containerized environments, think of it that. Because these hybrid clouds will run that with our build with cloud technologies where everything is virtualized, network's virtualized, infrastructure is virtualized, apps are virtualized. And Kubernetes, which is now in about 85% of our customer base is being used to orchestrate across all these various environments. So workloads can literally run on premise or in the cloud or multiple clouds and span across all of those environments.
So this is the world that we're in which is this blurring between old on-prem and public cloud environments. So that's why we talk about in this enterprise cloud because it's sort of everything. All sort of knowledge together with an underpinning of cloud technologies and approaches. And from that standpoint, there's a gradual migration to public clouds for sure. But there's so many data sources and environments on premise that are required in order for these applications to actually work properly. I mean, just think of an insurance company, you have your risk management system and your customer system on site. You're not going to put those data sets in the cloud, but yet all the applications, all the mobile apps and some of the other touch points are all sort of maybe running in a public cloud. So that creates hybrid environment which were extremely well suited for. Sure. That makes a sense. Thank you. Congratualations on a great quarter. Thank you very much. I think just in the interest of time, we're probably going to have to cut off the questions. And I know, I'm sorry about that. Thank you all for your interest. We're thrilled with our third quarter out as a public company. And I look forward to talking with all of you again in May when we're back with the end of our fiscal year, our fiscal 2020. So thank you very much. Have a good morning and take care. We'll talk soon. This concludes today's conference call.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, John Van Siclen. John? Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us on our Q4 and year-end fiscal '20 earnings call. Since late January, when we last broadcasted a Dynatrace earnings call, the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically impacted families, communities, and businesses around the world in a way that we never thought possible. It is our hope that everyone is staying healthy and safe and that those who have become ill have a speedy recovery. And of course, our hearts go out to those who have suffered the tragic loss of loved one.
Sudden shift to remote work has caused applications and the clouds they run on to become an even more essential way to provide services, drive revenue, engage customers, and collaborate among teams. We continue to work closely with our customers to help them respond to their rapidly changing workloads and requirements enabling faster innovation, easier collaboration, and greater efficiency without wasted motion. Despite these challenging times, I believe our strong platform differentiation, balanced business model, and world class team continue to provide us with a durable growth business.
I'd like to reinforce three points this morning. First, the success with which Dynatrace has responded to COVID-19 and what we are seeing across our customer base and market at large. Second, as this marks our fourth earnings call and the end of our fiscal 2020, I'd like to update you on the tremendous progress we've made in both our customer conversion and subscription business model transitions. And third, as our platform becomes increasingly robust across all modules an automation and AI become critical success factors for dynamic multi-clouds observability, I'd like to update you on some of the platform advances we've recently made and the success of our cross selling motion of emerging products. This will be an important growth area for us as we look ahead.
First, I could not be more proud of how the Dynatrace team responded to the challenges of COVID-19. With a modern SaaS platform and agile workforce, we transitioned to work from home almost overnight and did not miss a beat. We made sure we kept running so our customers could keep running. Not only were we essential to assuring the rapid shift to work from home was successful for our customers around the world, we also provided essential situational awareness to ensure business continuity of running the business applications, services, and workloads for banks, healthcare companies, logistics companies, government portals and more.
So despite what was essentially a two-week pause during mid-March as the shock of the global pandemic took hold and many of our customers were focused on the health and safety of their employees and establishing their work-from-home programs, we closed a solid Q4 with ARR up 42% year-on-year and subscription and services revenue up 37% year-on-year. Linearity and close rates were generally in line with prior Q4s. New logos were up year-on-year and our net expansion rate was above 120% for the eighth consecutive quarter.
We believe the strength of our results is largely a reflection of this mission critical nature of our software intelligence platform. Software eating the world has been a powerful multi-year trend that is still in the early innings and the rapid move to online commerce and work from home initiatives that made the uptime and performance of the underlying software applications and infrastructure more important than ever. Dynatrace platform addresses these same points, just fast to deploy and scale with rapid time to value. We believe, and our customers share the sentiment, that this places Dynatrace near the top of the strategic IT priority list.
The strong majority of our ARR roughly 80% to 85% is outside of industries, more challenged by COVID-19. And we also have strength in surging markets such as healthcare, e-learning, communications, and government. Our customer base is highly diversified and we focus on the top 15,000 largest enterprises around the world. This said, we do estimate that approximately 15% to 20% of our ARR is with enterprise customers that we consider to be in industries that are facing headwinds due to the health pandemic such as travel, hospitality, retail and automotive.
It is prudent to expect that new demand from these industries will be impacted somewhat in the near-term. However, at the same time, within these industries we are typically working with some of the largest and financially healthy companies and our solution is near the top of their priority list. What we have seen over the past eight weeks has shown us that essential applications and transformation projects continue to move forward even within industries experiencing headwinds.
For example, we did a sizable expansion deal in Italy in late March. This energy company wanted to assure continuous high quality service throughout the country and if issues arose proactively addressed them before service was impacted. In the past reacting after a failure occurred and service was already disrupted was not unusual. You can imagine with COVID and mandatory shelter at home, high quality energy service was an imperative. Dynatrace's rapid automatic rollout and unified AIOps approach to identifying service-impacting issues at time of degradation with precise actionable answers for rapid remediation made the Dynatrace expansion decision straightforward.
Another customer example was an oil company, a new logo to Dynatrace. In the midst of maybe the greatest disruption to the oil business in history this company determined it was essential to revamp and modernize its commodity to trading applications and the technology stack it was running on a shift to cloud for agility and efficiency for a set of revenue driving applications and services. They chose Dynatrace because of simplicity, advanced automation and rapid time to value.
It's too early to tell what the specific net impact of COVID-19 will be across our overall customer base and target market. But with a solid Q4 close and fast start to our June quarter with April bookings a bit stronger than a year ago, we are encouraged that we can generate solid growth even with an assumption that we will continue to operate within a challenging macro economic backdrop.
Shifting now to our progress converting our customer base and transitioning our business model FY20 was a fantastic year. We are where we hoped ahead of schedule. We now have 92% of our ARR on the Dynatrace platform with only 8% left on our classic product set. We added over 1,000 new customers to the Dynatrace platform this past year, now over 2,300 customers with the majority continuing to be new logos.
As we said before, nearly all these customers use Dynatrace for observing and optimizing cloud workloads. These clouds may be public, they may be hybrid or what we see more and more often now, they are multi-cloud, multi public with hybrid back ends where critical systems of record and many run the business applications still reside. More often than not Kubernetes is used for container orchestration. And more and more look to multiple DevOps teams utilizing the latest cloud native techniques to rapidly build, deploy and manage applications and workloads at scale.
With this combination of complexity, dynamism and frequency of change, only an automatic AI-assisted observability platform that can handle the most complex public and hybrid environments will work. I'm very pleased our customers have chosen to modernize with us and it's exciting to know that we are now part of their current and future digital transformation initiatives.
Regarding our business transition to a more predictable subscription model in Q4, 98% of revenue was subscription or services. Our transition from a classic license business to a subscription business is virtually complete. And we've done this while increasing gross margin to 83% overall and 88% for subscription. With over 90% of our customers on a release no more than 30 days old our operations and support teams are extremely efficient giving us more time to drive adoption and success across the Dynatrace base.
With the customer conversion and subscription business transitions now behind us, we look forward to driving a more streamlined one platform SaaS business in the years ahead. We'll be even more focused, we'll drive more value and we will remain resilient and durable.
Now to our platform. Simply put, we have never been in a stronger position. As response to COVID-19 is highlighted, applications need to work perfectly at all times to drive employee productivity, ensure optimal customer interaction, guarantee business and transactional continuity and so on. Work locations may change, workloads may shift, but applications must run flawlessly. Applications are the high ground. It's where the business meets IT.
Over the past month, the industry's leading analyst firm, Gartner, simultaneously released their annual APM Magic Quadrant and APM critical capabilities guide. For the tenth consecutive year, Dynatrace is considered a leader and once again we were given the highest marks among all competition provision.
In the critical capabilities guide our platform differentiation compared to competition is even more clear with Dynatrace leading in five of six categories. To achieve the separation requires a radically different approach to the challenges of modern cloud observability. We've made the bold decisions. Reinventing APM was just a piece of the puzzle. In Q4, we announced expanded capabilities for both our infrastructure-only module and our digital experience module. Over the past year, we have gone from approximately 15% of our customers buying three or more modules from us to over 25%, and that's on a rapidly growing customer base. Our cross-selling muscles are getting stronger.
Digital experience has been a popular module extension for us for a few years now. Recently, we have seen a surge in demand for mobile monitoring. Part of this is that we have made it easier than ever to instrument native mobile applications. And we believe part of this is a renewed appreciation for needing to assure that the full stack of cloud services, a complex layering of virtual services and processes actually deliver the value to the end user that is expected.
One of our banking customers recently saw a surge in mobile traffic as their customer base went to shelter in place. They quickly added licenses to cover the surge. Another bank told me they did not expect to see their surge in mobile traffic reduce much, if any, post-COVID. They said COVID has done more to train their customer base on the power and ease of home banking than any campaign they ever ran. With higher degrees of online mobile use likely to be a major outcome of the new normal our early investments and outstanding functionality in digital experience, especially for mobile, should continue to pay off for us.
Our infrastructure-only module is newer for us. It's now maturing as we expand coverage for AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform services. Unlike alternatives and only place metrics on dashboards, our unique platform capabilities like AI-assistance and Automation of scale strengthen this module significantly. Though early in the adoption ramp, we are very encouraged by the uptake of infrastructure only now used by 29% of our customer base. And they love the flexibility to toggle up or down on their own between our deep full stack APM mode and the lighter though broader coverage of infrastructure-only mode at a lower cost.
I should point out for those who are new to our story, our full stack APM module includes both infrastructure monitoring and AIOPs fully unified. And our infrastructure-only module includes log monitoring, network monitoring, and AIOPs, also fully unified. We package differently than our competition. Rather than fragment our offering into a list of tools, we take a more holistic approach and solve by use case going after a larger problem set to drive greater simplicity, efficiency, and value for our customers.
Let me summarize. I know I've covered a lot. First, our business has performed very well in the face of unprecedented macro challenges. Though a few of our in-markets may face greater near-term headwinds, we've been very encouraged by overall business trends during April. We believe Dynatrace is well-positioned to continue generating strong growth in an uncertain economic environment due to the fact that we have a differentiated leadership position in a category that is considered near the top of the strategic IT priority list. In addition, we are now a one platform subscription business. We made tremendous progress this past year converting our base to the new Dynatrace platform and completing our transition away from our classic license business. This renewed focus streamlines our go-to-market and builds a more predictable and durable growth business for the long term.
With that, let me turn it over to Kevin for a deeper look into our financials and the guide into Q1 and our full year fiscal 2021. Kevin. Thank you, John. And good morning everyone. Before I start, I would like to express my sympathy to all those who have been impacted by this health crisis and a huge thank you to all the amazing people who have been working tirelessly to help the world deal with the crisis especially everyone on the front lines.
The pandemic requires change and adaptation and we are no exception. Our main objective during this time has been to support our employees as well as our customers and their mission critical applications. As John indicated, we seamlessly moved to working remotely and our employees have adapted nicely. From a customer standpoint, we are pleased that our net retention rate remains robust in this environment. In the fourth quarter, we were modestly impacted on the new bookings side during the second half of March, but overall the fundamentals of our business remain very solid.
We had a strong performance in Q4 and have been very pleased with the progress we had made over the last four quarters as a public company including exceeding the high end of our quarterly and annual guidance. We continue to operate the business with a healthy combination of growth and profitability, a trend we believe we can continue to deliver on for quite some time given the increasing importance of cloud software and the strength of the Dynatrace platform and the expanding addressable market we operate in. As a result, despite some headwinds associated with the current environment, we are comfortable establishing full year guidance that calls for a combination of strong growth and subscription revenue coupled with meaningful profitability and cash flow. So let me start with a quick review of the fourth quarter and fiscal year highlights and then move to fiscal 21.
Our key financial metric focus on business momentum is annual recurring revenue. As John said, ARR grew 42% year over year to $572.8 million, an increase of $169 million compared to the year ago period. This was 44% growth on a constant currency basis and throughout the year our ARR faced currency headwinds in the range of 200 basis points to 300 basis points per quarter. The Dynatrace platform continues to increase as a percent of total ARR and was approximately $528 million at the end of March or 92% of our total ARR. The remaining 8% of our ARR relates to our classic offering.
We are extremely pleased with the success of our conversion program and now that the classic base is down to a single digit percentage of total ARR and shrinking each quarter, we feel there is no longer a need to break out these components. Moving forward, we will no longer be doing so.
The two drivers of ARR growth are new logo customers in our Dynatrace net expansion rate. If we quickly break down these two growth drivers, during the quarter, we added 165 net new Dynatrace customers ending the quarter with 2,373 Dynatrace customers. Consistent with recent quarters, new customers were a healthy balance of adding new logos to the franchise as well as classic customers moving to the Dynatrace platform. Over the last 12 months about 60% of our Dynatrace customer count growth has been the result of new logos to the company. As our conversion program winds down, the volume of new customer adds to the Dynatrace platform is likely to decline on a quarterly basis while obviously the ratio of new logos will increase.
In addition to a steady flow of new logos our Dynatrace net expansion rate remained at or above the 120% threshold for the eighth consecutive quarter. As of year-end, the Dynatrace net expansion rate was 123%. In fiscal '21, we'll continue to focus on the Dynatrace net expansion rate, but we will no longer exclude the impact from expansion at the time of conversion as we do not expect it to have a significant impact now that the Dynatrace platform is over 90% of our total business and growing.
Our Dynatrace ARR per customer continues to trend up and is over $220,000. We continue to believe that there is a large opportunity for further expansion in our existing customer base. The majority of applications at our customers still lack instrumentation, we continue to expand our value proposition in these cases and our enterprise customers continue to expand their portfolio of cloud-based applications as they digitally transform their businesses.
Moving to revenue, total revenue for the fourth quarter was $150.6 million, $2.6 million above the high end of our guidance, an increase of 30% on a year-over-year basis and 31% in constant currency. The acceleration in total revenue growth is being driven by the strong growth in subscription and services revenue, which was $148.3 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 37% year-over-year and 38% in constant currency. For the quarter, classic license revenue declined to $2.3 million and represented less than 2% of our quarterly revenue.
As John said, our non-GAAP gross margin was 83% for the fourth quarter, an increase from 80% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '19. We continue to see a healthy increase in our subscription gross margin percentage now at 88% as we realize the benefits of winding down the classic product stack. These world-class margins are a result of a highly reliable platform and autonomous SaaS operation, using Dynatrace on Dynatrace is a unique advantage for us.
Our non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter was $36 million above the high end of our guidance of $34.5 million, primarily due to the combination of revenue and associate gross margin upside. This led to a non-GAAP operating margin of 24%, up from 22% in the fourth quarter of '19. Non-GAAP net income was $29.8 million or $0.11 per share and so is above our guidance of $0.08 per share.
Turning to a quick summary, the financial results for the full year, total revenue was $545.8 million, up 27% year-over-year and up 29% in constant currency. Total revenue growth is being driven by the growth in subscription revenue, which was $487.8 million, an increase of 39% year-over-year and 42% in constant currency. Classic license revenue declined by $27.7 million to $12.7 million in fiscal '20. Overall, we believe our two-year model transition to a subscription business is now virtually complete.
Non-GAAP operating income for the year was $130 million with non-GAAP operating margin of 24%, up from 18% in fiscal '19, a very healthy year-over-year improvement in line with our internal expectations.
Turning to the balance sheet, as of March 31, we had $213 million of cash and our long-term debt was $510 million after taking into account $30 million principal payment in January. In the fourth quarter, we repriced our long-term debt to LIBOR plus 225 basis points, down 50 basis points. We are not anticipating any additional debt principal payments in the near term and so we want to grow our cash balance to maintain financial flexibility. We think this is prudent given current market conditions.
During fiscal '20, we consistently decreased our leverage ratio, which ended the fiscal year at 2.1x our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of about $140 million. This is down over one turn in eight months from our post IPO leverage ratio of 3.3x EBITDA.
Unlevered free cash flow for Q4 was $63.3 million and it was $149.5 million or 27.4% of revenue for fiscal '20. We experienced two headwinds to this number. There was about one percentage point due to lower classic perpetual bookings and about two percentage points due to higher DSO in Q4 resulting from a macro-environment uncertainty. We continue to evaluate our AR position and have not made any additional provisions for collectability outside of normal parameters.
The last financial measure that I would like to discuss is our remaining performance obligation, which at the end of the quarter was approximately $860 million, an increase of 56% over Q4 of last year. The current portion of RPO, which we expect to recognize as revenue over the next twelve months, was $495 million, an increase of 52% year-over-year. Our healthy RPO expansion has benefited from the move to a subscription business combined with an increase in the duration of our new subscription agreements over the course of fiscal '20.
Now let me move to guidance. Embedded in our guidance are few underlying assumptions that I think are noteworthy so you can understand our view of the environment and our opportunity as we move forward in fiscal '21. First, our assumption is that we are going to be operating in a difficult economic environment for the full fiscal year. We expect the greatest COVID headwinds on bookings and renewals in Q1 due to a global economic shutdown, with the headwinds gradually declining over the course of the fiscal year. Second, we expect a little over two points of currency headwinds to continue throughout the year.
From a customer standpoint, as John mentioned, our exposure to highly affected verticals such as travel, automotive, and hospitality represent 15% to 20% of our ARR. However, based on the enterprise size of our base and conversations with many of these customers, they view the Dynatrace platform as a mission critical platform and, as a result, we expect only a modest negative impact on our renewal rates within this portion of our customer base. As an aside, we have closed new business with customers in some of these verticals so far in the first quarter, which is further support for our expectation of a modest negative impact.
From a profitability and cash flow perspective, there are also a few key points to highlight. First, we expect to modestly grow headcount in Q1 as we initially moderated the timing of investments as we evaluated the impact of the health crisis on our business. We have increased the pace of hiring and plan to reaccelerate our commercial and innovation investments later in the fiscal year if the demand environment is playing out as we expect or better. As a result, from a P&L standpoint you should expect to see higher operating income in the first part of the year and then normalizing out as we go into the back half.
Finally, with respect to cash and working capital, we believe it is prudent to expect that some customers may request modified billing terms, which does not impact revenue but would serve as a headwind to our unlevered free cash flow throughout the year. With that as the backdrop for the first quarter, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $148 million to $150 million representing year-over-year adjusted currency growth of 24% to 25%.
We expect first quarter non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $38 million to $40 million, 25% to 27% of revenue and non-GAAP of $0.09 or $0.10 per share. For the full year, ARR guidance is $680 million to $692 million, 19% to 21% growth. We expect total revenue to be in the range of $630 million to $643 million representing year-over-year growth of 15% to 18% and 17% to 20% growth adjusted for currency.
Looking at the components of revenue, we assume that classic license revenue declines from about $13 million in fiscal '20 to under $1 million in fiscal '21. Based on the current guidance, we expect services revenue to be down on a year-over-year basis in the 10% range given that we have moved almost all of our customers to the Dynatrace platform where the product is automated and needs less services combined with our SI partners doing more services work.
As a one-time guidance disclosure, we believe subscription revenue will be in the range of $591 million to $601 million, which is 21% to 23% growth and 23% to 25% growth on a currency-adjusted basis. I would like to also quickly highlight our fiscal 21 expectations with respect to our Dynatrace net expansion rate. As John highlighted earlier and we noted in our earnings release today, we have achieved eight quarters at or above 120%. It continues to be a strong part of our business. However, based on the current revenue guidance, we anticipate we would experience a modest decline in our net expansion rates throughout fiscal '21 resulting in a net expansion rate above 115% for the year. We feel great about the fundamentals of the business and feel confident we have a good balance between both customer net expansion and new logo growth.
Moving to the rest of the P&L non-GAAP operating income for fiscal '21 is expected to be in the range of $146 million to $156 million which is 23% to 24% of revenue, non-GAAP EPS of $0.39 to $0.42 per share. From a cash flow perspective, in addition to the AR and working capital headwind I discussed, our effective cash tax rate is expected to go from 8% of non-GAAP pre-tax income to approximately 10% resulting in incremental cash tax expenses of about $5 million. Despite the AR cash tax headwinds, we believe we can increase unlevered free cash flow as a percent of revenue from 27% last year to a range of 29% to 30% which is $180 million to $190 million. Based on the midpoint of this range, unlevered free cash flow would increase 24% on a year-over-year basis.
In summary, we are very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year performance and with a market leading position, we remain confident Dynatrace is well-positioned for the long term. Most important for our shareholders is that we continue to show our financial profile that we believe is durable and unique including meaningful scale, strong growth, healthy profitability and cash flow.
With that, we will open the call for questions. Certainly. [Operator Instructions]. Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets, your line is open. Well, hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. And glad you're well and thoughts go out to everybody as it relates to COVID. John, a lot of good commentary on how you're helping customers navigate this difficult situation really in a world post-COVID where CILs look to embrace cloud even faster than before. Do you think this ultimately accelerates the importance of cloud-based monitoring and perhaps could it help you even address your TAM faster than before? Matt, appreciate the question. We do. We also believe that not only will this new normal sort of really highlight and focus the lens on cloud, it will also focus the lens on applications themselves as the high ground for where business meets IT. So I think we're in a really strong position from that standpoint. I also feel that the automation and the AI that we've built into our platform from the ground up will also be sort of essential care-abouts for IT as they move forward because it's really going to be about how do I take my existing team, my limited resources and do more with that? How do I move faster? How do I get to more applications? How do I innovate more effectively? And these characteristics of our platform that our customers are currently enjoying, we hope many customers -- additional customers ahead will be enjoying in the future. That's great. And then the other thing that really stood out to me I think you noted 25 customers are now buying three or more products which is great. I'm wondering though, can you talk about that trend within new customers? In other words, are new customers now landing with a higher cadence of new products than say, let's say, a year ago? They are, but I don't have all the quant for that but anecdotally, yes. It's some look to add the infrastructure piece and extend the infrastructure environment along with their full stack of APM because they're thinking about laying down a broader cloud platform. Others look to the APM and extend it first with the digital experience piece because they want a complete view of the application stack from the outside in. So they need either from the edge on in through all the virtual cloud layers to make sure that the performance and capability that they're expecting to deliver is actually delivered to that mobile device, or IoT device, et cetera. So those are the two primary that will go together depending on the point of view of the customer was pretty quick to add there and go keep going from there. Sterling Auty with JPMorgan, your line is open. Hi, guys. This is Matt on for Sterling. Thanks for taking the questions. The first question was just curious to see did you guys see customers' needs shifting? I'm guessing more of the activity in terms of the uptake was more focused on the cloud versus on-prem. But I just wanted to get some more color on that front. So first, all of our customers or nearly every one of them is focused on cloud and cloud workloads. Whether they deploy our platform, have us host it or whether they host it behind their firewall, still the same SaaS platform exactly the same code. So from that standpoint, we really haven't seen that much of a shift at this point although we do expect to see a little bit more leaning to a Dynatrace hosted environment.
That said, what we have seen are that the customers are shifting -- shifted their focus to work from home for probably four weeks. Actually they're still doing little bit more here and there, but those are things where they focused on making sure that employee productivity was optimized sort of leaned in to some of our hybrid extensions like Citrix monitoring, some of our third-party cloud monitoring capability so they could assure Salesforce, Microsoft 365, Zoom, some of these other third-party clouds that they depended on actually performed as advertised to keep their workforce productive. What we're seeing now is a leaning back toward faster to the future investments back into digital transformation and we think that will characterize sort of that -- sort of the post-COVID we're all here as we enter Q2 and beyond for the year. Great. That's very helpful. And then just one follow-up maybe for Kevin. So long-term deferred declined sequentially. Was just trying to understand if that was from customers that have -- that are doing shorter contracts or if there was something else there that we should be aware of? So generally over half of our customers are signing three-year agreements with us, but please keep in mind that our payment terms are annual in advance, so that does not necessarily -- that does not impact our long-term deferred. What you're actually seeing is the burn down of the perpetual licenses that we've sold primarily sort of two years ago and a little bit last fiscal year. As you may recall, we recognized those licenses over three years and as we're bringing that down, that's going to have an impact on our long-term deferred and as you can imagine that also puts some pressure on unlevered free cash flow for this year fiscal '20 and it will put a little bit of pressure continuing pressure in 20 -- fiscal '21, and then it will alleviate thereafter primarily. So we sold perpetual licenses two to three years ago. It was pretty healthy, but that has essentially gone at zero at this point and it's just so working down at that perpetual license and long-term deferred. Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs, your line is open. Great. Thank you so much guys for taking the question and, John, really helpful opening remarks. So thank you so much for them and how detailed they were. A couple of questions. Just you mentioned that new logos are up. I was wondering if you could mention maybe how the size of the new lands may be being impacted, have you noticed anything in terms of the size of those given what's going on? And even particular what might be more helpful just in Q1, if there's any difference? And then thank you for the commentary on NER, the 123% you gave and even the color about next year. But just wondering was the 123% -- and I know this is the first time you've actually given the exact number, was that a tick down at all from what you saw in the prior quarter? And then I just have a follow-up. Sorry. Thank you. Yes. Let me start with the new logos. So we actually have seen the new logo land in -- at -- in $92,000 or $100,000 range now for quarters on end, so it's very consistent in that range. So nothing really to note plus or minus there. If anything, it's ticking up slightly, but I think that's a result of the sales organization being more effective at selling at least a second module if not three modules at once when they actually land a new customer but it's not material, but it has not dropped if that was sort of like the part of the question. And I think it's a healthy place to land. We were not really -- I know some folks out there may think we're a big deal company and everything's a multi-million dollar deal. We're actually a much higher volume transaction company where we really focus on land and expand. Where we land in 100k and then we expand gradually with our customers as they expand their footprint as they add more applications and now more than ever as they add additional modules. So where -- we like where we are, we think it's the right place to be at an enterprise -- as an enterprise-focused company focused on the global 15,000. And so I like where we are and I think we're going to maintain that going throughout the next several years. Kevin? Yes. Heather, on the Dynatrace, the net expansion rate, it was a modest decline from the prior quarter, less than 1% from prior quarter, so relatively flat Q3 to Q4. To put a little bit more color in terms of where they think where it's going in the future, based on what we view as prudent guidance on the top-line and a combination of what we think will be helping new logos, mathematically obviously that net expansion rate is dropped down from that 120% bar down to 115%.
With that said, we're optimistic. John about a lot of expansion opportunities and our customer base at the low point and hopefully throughout the course of the year we will maintain a much healthier net expansion rate.
I think one final thing is that Dynatrace net expansion rate had a couple of carve-outs in it. And if you looked at our total company expansion rate over the last four quarters, it's been higher than the Dynatrace net expansion rate because we are again backing out some expansion at the time of conversion. So overall, we're very pleased with the retention, we're very pleased with our customers expanding their footprint, an use case event as John was talking about earlier, more modules over time as well. And then one just quick follow-up to the last question that was related to long-term deferred. So based on your comments, should we expect -- I think it went from $80 million to $60 million off the top of my head, but should we expect that phase to continue, so when you look out over 12 to 18 months that should be a much smaller number than where we just ended? That's right. You want to think maybe six to eight quarters and that -- and that'll be wrapped, but most of it, Heather, in the next six quarters in terms of that long-term deferred wind down and then just wrapping up in eight quarters. So we will always have some level of long-term deferred, but that's the timeframe. Bhavan Suri with William Blair & Company, your line is open. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I'm glad everyone's doing well. Congrats on the quarter. Couple of quick questions from me. One, just on the top of the funnel. I know you've talked about the exposure to some of the affected industries and some of your expectations around sales, hiring ramp, but love to understand what you've seen on the top of the funnel. In this environment feels like the digital experience thing should be really picking up. It feels like infrastructure, multi-cloud is interesting, but that piece to me seems really interesting as well some of the AI related pieces. You said April's off to a good start, but just love to understand you're seeing at the top of funnel in terms of what's driving some of those deals coming in today? And sort of how do you think that plays out going forward, say, for the next two, three quarters, which is COVID time driven and post-COVID? Do you think logically there might be an acceleration of business? Just love trying to understand how you think about that coming out of COVID too. Yes, Bhavan. Thank you. Thanks for the question. So we're not seeing a huge shift in sort of the characteristics, we didn't see that four weeks before for we kind of shift to work from home and people leaning into different aspects of our product line for employee productivity. But the bulk of our business is really focused on run the business applications that run on -- in modern cloud environments, more and more that multi-cloud environment that I articulated, combination of multiple public cloud with hybrid back ends, and that environment continues to be more prevalent and accelerating. People are really getting sort of the hang of how to unmanage these large complex Kubernetes orchestrated environments, they understand how difficult and challenging they are. We have a very unique highly automatic solution with built-in AI to help them manage these environments and extend them more quickly than ever without the blind spots associated with sort of the do-it-yourself or bag of tools kind of approach, that's sort of the alternative that we see most often out there.
So coming out of this COVID-19 sort of situation and into a new normal, I really do believe that our automation and AI will become sort of primary drivers for differentiation rather than sort of interesting nice to have kinds of characteristics the way they might be in certain sales cycles that we've had in the past. So I like our differentiation, I like where we sit, and I think we're very well-positioned for a new normal and a faster to cloud with limited resources. Got you. Got you. Okay. And then one quick one sort of on the competitive environment and really around pricing. So you obviously talk about the land at 100 grand. But you are a premium offering when you think about it compared to say New Relic or Datadog and others. And I guess the premium offering was sort of the price point, it's not a viral sale, it's not using credit card, et cetera, well above that they have New Relic. Did that present any challenge at all in that first four weeks or have you seen any pressure from -- or changes in the price environment, competitive environment? Love to understand what, if there was any impact at all? Yes. Well, first of all, you need to understand that our sales organization for the most part works remotely anyway. They don't sit in offices, they work from home. They're all very familiar with Zoom and our platform is a SaaS platform so that anything you can do sort of on-site, you can do remotely. So whether its demonstrations, proof of concepts, helping customers sort of manage environments, making sure that they adopt the latest techniques, all done remotely. So there's no miss on the beat in a shift from office to work from home. So that's I think the first key thing.
The second thing is, as I mentioned, we package our product differently, Bhavan. It's much more around use cases or a series of use cases rather than little slices of tools. And we believe that that's a more effective, more efficient, higher value way to support customers at the enterprise level. So we include multiple things. When we talk about APM platform, we're including infrastructure monitoring, we're including AIOps. Other companies have to sell three or four products to do what we do in one. Same thing with infrastructure-only, it includes log monitoring, includes network monitoring because that's what you need to solve the full infrastructure challenge, you don't self-buy three products.
So I think that as our customers become familiar with how that works and really appreciate the fact that it's a unified offering, we're all gluing up all the pieces together already done for you rather than you have to throw bodies at that and then maintain it over time. So our customers, who get to know us and why we expand as well as we do on our base, understand that we're sort of the value leader even if they pay a little bit more for the combination of unified software we provide. [Operator Instructions]. Kash Rangan with Bank of America, your line is open. Hi. Thank you very much. Congrats on the quarter. I'm looking at your forward looking trends. Your month of April is actually stronger than the month -- year earlier. Net expansion rate continues to be very solid. Looks like the front end of the pipeline is also pretty solid from a demand generation standpoint and the sales execution also has been enabled through Zoom on virtual settings. Yet what I struggled to reconcile all that, with all the field work that we've done -- and also by the way, your RPO very strong. And when I reconcile that with your guidance, there is extreme, extreme, extreme conservatism, although it is prudent to have conservatism it is just very extreme. Just wondering if you have probably assumed even Draconian because if I just take the net expansion rate and the fact that 80%, 85% of your business is within healthy verticals, it doesn't quite add up to what you're guiding to, so I'm just trying to understand how critically conservative you've been with your guidance? Thank you so much. Yes. There are certainly a lot of positives that we've seen throughout the course of fiscal '20 and leading indicators into the first quarter of '21. And as highlighted as well, some of the things that when we think about '21 that are important, I -- we had 80% coverage on our guide number from a subscription standpoint and backlog plus RPO. So, look, with that in mind, John and I spent some time thinking about the business, and overall our approach is we want to be very prudent, we want to set the bar that we feel extremely comfortable with. And hopefully, we have a good beat and raise strategy throughout the course of the year as our program evolves. We're very optimistic about the opportunity. Sales organization is in action, they're doing well. Our renewal rates are very healthy. But little bit of the uncertainty, we just thought it'd be very prudent to set really solid foundation, Kash. Raimo Lenschow with Barclays, your line is open. Yes. Hey, thank you. Question on the infrastructure monitoring. Like, you mentioned that you're -- more comprehensive there and you can do a lot more stuff. But if you look at the adoption, at the moment a lot of people just kind of asked to go to the cloud, just needs like an early quick solution there. So how do you see that playing out, like people understanding that you can deliver a lot more so you will be kind of the secondary guy adopted as kind of people realize they actually need more? What do you see that, already like in the first phase kind of playing out, just to understand how that momentum is playing out there? Thank you. Sure. Good question. Well, we see both dynamics. We see the dynamic when we come in when workloads start hitting the cloud in volume and the customer understands that all they have is an infrastructure view, they don't have the application view and the application teams need more visibility across sort of what's happening with these workloads in a dynamically orchestrated environment and realize that nothing really provides that. Even if you're able to pull some traces off, you don't have them a distributed tracing capability that really gives you value in that application layer, which is why we talk about entering many of our opportunities through sort of an APM lens and landing and then expanding from there.
We do see customers at the time they make the decision to expand their cloud investments to actually understand that they need more than just infrastructure only monitoring and they go out and they look for the full stack observability platform. And then that -- then we enter earlier even before the volume of workloads have been placed on their cloud environment. So we do have a combination of both, but I'd say it leans right now more heavily to the -- I'm expanding the workloads on the cloud, I have lots of blind spots, I need to fix this, I can't do this with a bunch of tools, I need something more comprehensive, that's our primary, but the other one is starting to grow more and more often coming up off of sort of the good hygiene approach as customers get more familiar with the right models to expand cloud effectively. Okay. Makes sense. Hopefully that makes sense to you? Yeah. That makes sense. Hynes with Canaccord, your line is open. Hi. Thanks guys. Congrats on the results. Hey, John, just in terms of the expansion opportunity, can you just remind us where the average customer is in terms of percent of apps or staff that's being monitored and then maybe where some of your best customers are? Sure. Well, so many companies are still in that 5% to 10% of their application range. The cloud is driving the need to adopt much higher than some of the old Gartner stats that said, hey, 25% to 30% receiving customers in the 50%, 60% range where they run the business applications and associated workloads around it. We have customers in that 30% to 40% percent range who want to continue to go up, but that's the minority. The vast majority are really in that 5% to 10% range. There's a lot of room just in the up sell, let alone the cross-sell which as I said we're getting much stronger in.
When you take a look at our landing zone which is in that $90,000 to $100,000 range and then you look at our average ARR per customer which is now a little over $220,000, there's a lot of room to continue growing that average ARR per customer, toward a million-dollar ARR per customer which we believe any global 15,000 company or any billion-dollar company would be willing to invest to assure that their applications that run the business applications run flawlessly all the time.
Okay. One more question, I think. Our final question comes from a line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Your line is open. Hi. Thanks. Just a clarification on the hiring. Sounds like you did slow it, you resumed it. Can you talk about sales hiring and how we should think about sales capacity build in fiscal '21 and how's that, any slowing in hiring is impacting the growth rate you're looking for in '21, and then sort of what you're looking for specifically in sales in order to re-accelerate the hiring? Thanks. Yes. So we haven't stopped the hiring and sales folks. We did slow it down a little bit but the focus is still on the gas. And we've been re-accelerating it as we're building more and more confidence in this year and they -- that's sort of the current uncertainty becomes a little bit less uncertain. So you should expect us to bring our investments back to where they were year ago which were healthy investments in sales expansion, also R&D, the innovation expansion and customer success expansion. Those are the three key vectors for us and we're leaning into all those currently. All right. Thank you very much everyone. Appreciate the time this morning. And I hope you can tell we're bullish on the business. Good Q4. Good start to Q1. We're going to continue to run a balanced business which I know which Kevin and I stay focused on to grow profit and scale, and we're excited about the future. We look forward to this year and catching up again in 90 days and talking about how we did in our fiscal Q1. Cheers, everyone. Stay healthy.

A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP measures can be found on the Investor Relations section of our Web site. And lastly, references to growth rates will be in constant currency, unless otherwise noted.
And with that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, John Van Siclen. John? Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our Q1 fiscal '21 earnings call. Since early May when we last reported earnings, the COVID-19 pandemic has continued to impact families, communities, and businesses around the world. We don’t have to go far to find friends or family impacted by this unprecedented situation, and I truly hope that you and your loved ones have remained safe and healthy.
Despite the challenging economic backdrop resulting from the COVID pandemic, digital transformation projects continue to be prioritized as essential, as companies strive for greater agility, efficiency and speed to market, and Dynatrace continues to be considered an essential component for sustained digital transformation success.
I’m pleased to report that the solid business performance we saw in April continued throughout our fiscal Q1. For the quarter, ARR was up 39% year-on-year, and subscription revenue was up 37% year-on-year. And once again, we coupled our strong top line growth with strong bottom line results as well.
With resilient value proposition well-suited to the digital transformation macro trends we see ahead and a predictable subscription business delivering growth and profitability at scale, we continue to be optimistic about our future opportunity and the durability of our business for long-term value creation.
Based on the strength of our Q1 results and ability to grow through the difficult economic backdrop, we have increased our annual guidance for revenue and profitability, as Kevin will discuss in a few minutes. There are three areas that I’d like to highlight this morning that give us confidence in our ability to achieve our increased guidance for fiscal 2021.
First, the essential role that Dynatrace plays in the success of our customers’ digital transformations; second, with digital transformation taking place in modern dynamic multiclouds, how Dynatrace is well-positioned to continue growing ARR by adding new customers and expanding our platform across our growing base. And third, how we plan to continue investing in both commercial expansion and ongoing innovation to expand market share and take advantage of the large and rapidly growing TAM we have in front of us.
Thousands of companies have embraced digital transformation as a primary way to drive revenue, provide services, engage customers, and collaborate among teams. For these reasons, we are beginning to see an acceleration of digital transformation projects around the globe.
According to a recent May survey by Fortune magazine, 75% of CEOs anticipate accelerating their digital transformation projects. Customers tell us that they consider Dynatrace an essential element of executing a successful digital transformation as they drive towards greater agility, efficiency, and business effectiveness.
Despite the global pandemic continuing to delay some new sales cycles, customers’ confidence in Dynatrace and the intelligent observability we provide into their dynamic multicloud ecosystems underpinning these transformations is reflected in our strong first quarter results across all key operating measures.
As we discussed in early May, our approach to the pandemic was to immediately focus on our 2,400 Dynatrace customers worldwide to help them through their work-from-home transitions and shifting cloud workloads. Ensuring customer success in times of challenge helps strengthen long-term relationships, an important part of our growth strategy. This approach also helped us maintain a net expansion rate above 120% for the ninth consecutive quarter.
A great example of how digital transformation continues to fuel our expansion efforts within our base is a large brick-and-mortar retailer with an expanding digital footprint. This customer first brought Dynatrace in to bring application observability to their cloud modernization project.
During the initial deployment, the retailer experienced firsthand how Dynatrace's rapid automatic rollout and unified AIOps approach to identify service impacting issues save them time, money, and resources across more than just application use cases.
Dynatrace’s unified data model allowed them to teardown silos among teams, create more effective collaboration, accelerate innovation, simplify operations, and drive greater online and in-store success. This drove the recent decision to standardize on Dynatrace across infrastructure monitoring, log analytics, and digital experience monitoring in addition to APM.
Consolidating multiple disparate tools while gaining the power of unified observability, advanced automation, and AI-powered intelligence is a powerful combination of value as more of our customers strive to do more with less. And it’s this unified platform value that we believe will allow us to continually expand our ARR per customer over time from the $229,000 on average we see today to what we believe can be over $1 million per customer, as we did with this retailer.
While we increased focus on back-to-base selling during Q1, we are also excited to have added some fantastic new enterprise relationships around the globe with organizations like National Grid, MGM, Texas Health, and Human Services, Yale University, and Banco Sabadell. Digital transformation continues to happen across all industries, even those currently challenged by COVID.
Take the U.S. airline, a new logo for Dynatrace this past quarter. Despite the fact that travel is down dramatically on a year-over-year basis, this customer came to Dynatrace to optimize conversions from initial customer contact to booked tickets. The airline has taken a classic multitool approach to monitoring with different digital teams favoring their own tooling. This left them with silos of data and blind spots from how users were truly experiencing the revenue driving booking application.
With mobile usage increasing rapidly and the need for greater efficiency rising quickly, they knew their approach had to change. After demonstrating the power of connecting applications, infrastructure, and user experience observability with conversion funnel KPIs, the airline quickly rolled out Dynatrace into production. Within days, actionable answers about conversion, bottlenecks, and optimization opportunities allowed the airline to make high-impact improvements to maximize passenger revenue.
After experiencing the speed, efficiency, and simplicity of the Dynatrace platform compared to their previous tools, customer commented, “You guys are Usain Bolt and the other guys are simply weekend joggers.” We believe this powerful unification of cloud observability data with business value metrics will continue to drive our new logo growth as we penetrate deeper into our target global 15,000 account base.
As we enter Q2 with work-from-home disruptions largely behind us and digital transformation projects continuing to accelerate, we see the opportunity to increase the balance of our sales efforts by increasing our focus again on new logos. Our pipeline is strong and our differentiation is compelling. The resulting do much more with much less effort and cost to value proposition is powerful, especially now when IT and development organizations feel more and more pressure to move faster and accelerate their digital transformations.
Speaking of market position and opportunity, this brings me to my second point. Not only is the general macro trend of digital transformation fueling our business, so are the disruptive trends shaping modern cloud environments. As we’ve said before, nearly all our customers use Dynatrace for the intelligent observation and optimization of modern cloud workloads. These clouds may be public, they may be hybrid or what we see more and more often now, they are multicloud, multi-public with hybrid back-ends where critical systems of record and many run the business applications still reside.
More often than not, Kubernetes is used for container orchestration and more and more look to multiple DevOps teams utilizing the latest cloud native techniques to rapidly build, deploy and manage applications and workloads at upscale. With this combination of complexity, dynamism and frequency of change, only an automatic AI-assisted observability platform will work. The ongoing innovation across our platform continues to put us in a strong position to take advantage of these disruptive shifts in the cloud platform and cloud native application landscape.
Let me give you a quick example of what I’m talking about here. A SaaS solution provider for K-12 school administration serving over 12,000 educational organizations and 80,000 schools; as this organization approach their renewal date for one of their existing monitoring tools, they brought in Dynatrace and another company for a three-way bakeoff.
While skeptical at first that Dynatrace was different, three things became clear during the evaluation that made Dynatrace a clear choice. First, the automation and AI at the core of our platform showed how they could quickly, continuously and intelligently observe and understand their dynamic Kubernetes environment, something that was highly manual and left them searching for answers with their current tooling.
Second, they realized that with instant and precise answers, they could speed product delivery by automating large parts to their DevOps delivery pipeline that previously had required manual steps burning precious time, invaluable resource. And third, the power of the Dynatrace one solution became clear as the customer expanded the scope of the pilot beyond APM.
As they further investigated Dynatrace for an infrastructure monitoring initiative by leveraging our common data model and unified AIOps approach across both infrastructure and application use cases, they realized they could eliminate silos between their cloud operations and applications teams, smoothing collaboration and accelerating innovation.
With IDC, Gartner and other leading industry analysts predicting the continued expansion of dynamic multicloud environments as a platform of choice for global enterprises and the rise in AIOps as a requirement for allowing resource-strapped IT and development organizations to do much more with much less effort in cost, we believe the Dynatrace value proposition and platform differentiation will continue to serve us well both in gaining new enterprise cloud customers and in expanding ARR per customer over time.
Now let me touch on the third point, investing in growth. Given the fact that we are fortunate to be in an industry category that is well-positioned to continue thriving during a difficult economic environment and we have a highly differentiated platform well-positioned for any disruptive cloud trends ahead, I want to reiterate that we are continuing to invest aggressively in growth.
We expanded our global team by over 90 employees in Q1 with over 100 more already signed on to start throughout Q2. Sales, customer success and R&D continue to be the primary areas of investment for us, as we expand our customer base on our platform footprint.
We also recently completed our FedRAMP certification at moderate impact level, which gives us broader access to the massive digital transformation effort of the U.S. government. We've doubled our sales investment in U.S. federal government over the past year and expect to see this business segment continue to grow at an accelerated rate.
On the product front, we are committed to investing in ongoing innovation. Our largely European-based R&D organization continues to expand, including a new lab recently opened in Vienna, Austria. And we continue to expand the capabilities of all five monetizable modules as well as bring greater scale, fault tolerance and extensibility to the platform itself.
This past quarter, we extended scalability and fault tolerance for our largest customers, allowing them to extend to hybrid clusters across geographically distributed clouds with full fault tolerance in case one of their cloud operation centers should go down.
For our many Kubernetes customers, we announced extended AI-powered support for advanced observability of Kubernetes’ infrastructure, container and application workloads. Now, our customers can get a unified view across all tiers to better understand, manage, troubleshoot and optimize their growingly complex Kubernetes clusters, the cloud native applications that run on them and the backend data sources and middleware these modern cloud applications depend on to operate effectively.
And we continue to mature our infrastructure monitoring and log analytics module with greater coverage of cloud services, including all 80 of the core Azure services. I think it's important to note that when we add coverage, we don't just add a data feed for a service. We have one agent automation, unified dependency understanding across all cloud dimensions with Smartscape, and AI understanding with Davis to provide ease of ongoing operation and intelligent answers and insights for greater efficiency and lower ongoing costs.
It's gratifying when all this work, all our innovation and value is recognized by third parties, but it's especially gratifying when the feedback comes from your customers. During the quarter, G2, a leading peer review site had reviewers rank observability platform leaders across several use cases. Dynatrace came out number one, including number one rankings across cloud infrastructure monitoring, AIOps platforms, application performance monitoring, container monitoring, digital experience monitoring and session replay categories.
Our platform expansion continues to gain traction with our customer base with the number of Dynatrace customers now using three or more modules, up 44% over the past six months. We’re grateful for the support and recognition of our many customers and pleased our reputation as the modern cloud observability leader continues to grow.
So let me summarize as I’ve covered a fair amount this morning. Our opportunity is large and growing rapidly. It's fueled by powerful macro trends of digital transformation and dynamic multicloud adoption. We have proven the resilience of our value proposition in times of challenge and the power of our differentiation to both acquiring new logos as well as expand rapidly within our base.
This combination, along with the investments we continue to make in commercial expansion and ongoing innovation, put us in a strong position in a market segment that will continue to sit near the top of the strategic IT priority list for some time to come.
With that, let me turn it over to Kevin for a deeper look into our financial results and guidance. Kevin? Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As John mentioned, we had a strong start to our fiscal '21 with solid growth in ARR, revenue and earnings. There's still a fair amount of uncertainty in the global economy, but our solid first quarter results demonstrate that digital transformation is critical for business success. As we look ahead, we continue to be optimistic about our sustainable growth potential.
So, let me start with a quick review of the first quarter financial highlights and then move on to our outlook. Annual recurring revenue continues to be one of the key financial measures to understand the momentum of our business. ARR grew to $601 million. That’s up 39% year-over-year, an increase of $164 million on an as reported basis compared to the year ago period.
The two drivers of ARR growth are new logo customers and our Dynatrace net expansion rate. As we mentioned on our last call, over the last few months, we increased our sales focus to help our existing customers establish their work-from-home and digital transformation efforts. This contributed to our strong net expansion rate, which remained over 120% for the ninth consecutive quarter. ARR per Dynatrace customer also increased to $229,000, up over 10% year-over-year.
We added 85 net new customers in Q1, bringing our total Dynatrace customer count to 2,458 customers. As expected, the combination of our increased focus on our install base coupled with a more challenging business environment led to a moderation in new additions to the Dynatrace platform in the first quarter.
We have a solid pipeline of new logos for the second quarter and we believe new logo adds will be roughly 450 for the remainder of this year. This would be consistent with the new logo additions from the same period last year and ahead of our initial guidance assumption coming into the year based on the resilience of digital transformation projects and the essential role Dynatrace plays in ensuring digital transformation success.
Moving to revenue. Total revenue for the first quarter was $155.5 million, $5.5 million above the high end of our guidance and representing an increase of 30% on a year-over-year basis. The strength in total revenue growth is being driven by 37% growth in subscription revenue, partially offset by the expected decline in classic license revenue which now represents less than 1% of our quarterly revenue.
With respect to margins, we continue to see a healthy expansion in our gross margins as the subscription revenue mix increases. Total non-GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was 85%, up 2 percentage points from last quarter and up 3 percentage points from Q1 of last year. We are very pleased with our margin performance, primarily due to the efficient way we manage our platform coupled with modest cost savings related to the macro shutdown.
Our non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $50.8 million, above the high end of our guidance of $40 million due to revenue and gross margin upside expansion and lower than expected operating expenses due to prudent expense management as we evaluated the business environment over the course of the quarter. This led to a non-GAAP operating margin of 33%, up 11 percentage points from the first quarter last year.
While this performance shows the operating leverage potential inherent in our business, given the strength of our platform and the growing TAM we operate in, we do you intend to accelerate intelligent investments in innovation and commercial expansion as we move forward in fiscal '21. As a result, consistent with what we communicated last quarter, we do expect margins will come down from Q1 levels as we move throughout the fiscal year. Non-GAAP net income was $36.9 million or $0.13 per share, $0.03 above the high end of our guidance.
Turning to the balance sheet. As of June 30, we had $250 million of cash and our long-term debt was $510 million. Given the strength of our cash flow and confidence in the business, we recently reinitiated our program to further reduce our outstanding debt. As a result, we made a principal repayment of $30 million in early July, reducing our debt balance to $480 million.
Since our IPO, we have consistently improved our leverage ratio which ended the first quarter at 1.6x our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Our leverage ratio is down over 50% from our post-IPO leverage ratio of 3.3x. As a reminder, our unlevered free cash flow can be a bit lumpy on a quarterly basis with our strongest cash generation occurring in the last quarter of the fiscal year, following the seasonality of growth bookings and renewals. Therefore, we believe the best way to look at our unlevered free cash flow is in our full year or trailing 12-month basis to smooth out the effect of quarterly seasonality.
For the first quarter, unlevered free cash flow was $37 million. We were very pleased with our Q1 performance, which was nicely above our internal expectations. On a GTM basis, unlevered free cash flow was $141 million which was 24% of revenue. We continue to expect to deliver full year unlevered free cash flow margins of 29% to 30%.
The last financial measure that I would like to discuss is our remaining performance obligation, which, at the end of the quarter, was $857 million, an increase of 40% over Q1 of last year. The current portion of RPO, which we expect to recognize as revenue over the next 12 months, was $503 million, an increase of 42% year-over-year. Our healthy RPO expansion has benefited from the move to a subscription business combined with a general increase in the duration of our new subscription agreements.
Now, let’s move to guidance. As a reminder, all references to growth rates will be in constant currency, unless noted. As I mentioned earlier, after initial pausing on some expenses as we evaluated the business environment, we do plan to increase investments in the second quarter and the remainder of the fiscal year.
These will include additional hires to accelerate commercial expansion, further expansion in our labs to support innovation and ongoing investments in our customer success initiatives. As a result, we should expect to see higher operating expenses throughout the remainder of the year resulting in lower operating margins versus Q1, which ran well ahead of our expectations primarily due to the strength of our revenue.
With that as a backdrop, for the second quarter, we expect total revenue to be in a range of $159 million to $161 million, representing year-over-year growth of 25% to 26%. We expect Q2 subscription revenue to be in a range of $149 million to $150.5 million, representing year-over-year growth of 30% to 32%.
From a profit standpoint in Q2, we expect non-GAAP operating income to be in a range of $43 million to $45 million, 27% to 28% of revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $0.09 to $0.10 per share assuming 288 million to 289 million shares outstanding. We estimate a Q2 cash tax rate of approximately 30% due to the higher state cash taxes in the quarter.
For the full year, ARR guidance with $698 million to $708 million, 23% to 25% growth. We expect total revenue to be in the range of $646 million to $656 million representing the year-over-year growth of 20% to 22%. We expect our subscription revenue to be in a range of $603 million to $612 million, representing the year-over-year growth of 26% to 27%.
I would also like to highlight our fiscal '21 expectation with respect to our Dynatrace net expansion rate. As John mentioned earlier and we noted in our earnings release today, we have achieved nine quarters with a net expansion rate above 120%. This continues to be a strong part of our business.
Our current guidance assumes we’ll continue with healthy net expansion rates above 120% for the remainder of the fiscal year. This compares to our initial guidance assumption of 115%. And we are comfortable increasing this base in our Q1 performance, ongoing conversations with our customer base and the strength of our pipeline and renewals.
For the full year, we expect non-GAAP operating income to be in a range of $166 million to $175 million, non-GAAP EPS of $0.46 to $0.49 per share. This assumes a tax benefit between $6 million to $8 million in the back half of the year. We still expect our annual effective cash tax rate of approximately 11%, but will have quarterly variability.
And I mentioned this earlier, but just recollect [ph] again, we continue to expect unlevered free cash flow margins to be approximately 29% to 30%, resulting in $187 million to $195 million of unlevered free cash flow. Finally, we expect 288 million to 290 million diluted shares for fiscal '21.
We feel great about the resilience of the business and are confident that our growth will continue to be driven by healthy balance of existing customer expansion, combined with new logo growth.
We are affirming up the details of a virtual Investor Day for early September and you can expect a release with more specifics shortly. We look forward to sharing more details about our business strategy, market opportunities, product vision and continued investments and the development of new capabilities to fuel our future growth.
With that, we will take your questions. Operator? [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Hi, guys. Thanks for the time; and John and team, congrats on the strong results, very impressive. John, you talked about accelerated digital transformations post-COVID which is great to hear and really caught my attention. Can you talk about the level of monitoring at some of these customers? And I think you called out a large retailer in particular. Where were they at pre, from a monitoring perspective, and where are they at now when they certainly go all-in at Dynatrace? Thanks, Matt. I appreciate it. So, what we’re seeing just in general is sort of thesis that we had going into the quarter, but we of course guided cautiously in case there was things we didn’t see happening. But I think throughout the quarter, we saw much more resilience and the thesis of Dynatrace being essential for digital transformation really playing out. And as companies move to greater degrees of digital transformation, they are accelerating their cloud journeys because that’s what underpins digital transformation and they move their applications more rapidly from just a lift and shift model to true cloud native application designs. And as they do this, it seems great with agility and speed but the complexity, under the hood goes through the roof. And it’s that complexity that we simplify. Without instrumentation and sort of that kind of observability at scale which requires advanced degrees of automation and AIs to be able to handle that level of complexity when you’re talking about billions of dependencies with these micro services floating across multi-clouds, Dynatrace just starts to shine even brighter. And so – before COVID seemed like we can take our time and maybe we can still do it with our current investments of disparate tooling, quickly becomes there is no way we can accelerate digital transformation without making a change in our instrumentation model, in our observability model, in our automation model, and so on. And so that’s what we’re seeing is that as digital transformation accelerates, the need for a Dynatrace class solution even goes up. And that’s what we saw the beginnings of it in our fiscal Q1 and we continue to see it as we look out into Q2 and beyond with the sales cycles we’re now in. That’s great. And then Kevin, on ARR, 39% constant currency growth is super impressive, especially when you consider – I think last year you were at 43% growth. But I believe that saw a benefit from classic Dynatrace customers that this quarter didn’t see. I guess to that point, can you remind us roughly what the benefit was last year on that class of conversion? Because I think if you were to normalize for that, you might have even had similar ARR growth? That’s right. So if you look back and we maybe take the last six quarters, our average ARR growth on a constant currency basis was in the low 40%. When you break it out and you just look at new logos and expansion for our Dynatrace customers when they’re on the platform, that growth rate was about 39%, 40%. And again, this quarter on a constant currency basis, apples-to-apples, we grew 39%. So, most of the reduction in the ARR really came as a result of the fact that we’ve moved our customer base over to the Dynatrace platform and are expanding on that now. Super helpful. Well done, guys. Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe with UBS. Great. Thank you. Maybe just quickly on the ARR and continuing that train of thought, Kevin, you mentioned the assumption now is 120% of net new relative to 115% prior, but there’s also a lot of discussion on the focus on new logo acquisition and that being a big emphasis as we move through the remainder of the year. So can you just parse through, with the increase of ARR guidance, is that purely a function of the change in the assumption around net retention or are you also factoring in better new logo acquisition? What are sort of the puts and takes there because it seems like there’s few different drivers mentioned? Sure. If you sort of a take a step back, we set that 115% bar in a period of uncertainty three, four months ago. Given the strength of the business in the first quarter, be it combination of new logos, which are stronger than we had expected when we started the quarter and also a healthy net expansion rate, really our guidance – or our guidance I should say going forward is a combination of new logos. Growth rate is better than we were expecting about 90 days ago and a step up in the net expansion rate. So, we’re seeing strength from where we were 90 days ago in both segments of our business. If you look at the back three quarters, we’re expecting about 450 new logos which is fairly consistent with where we were last year. We had a healthy pipeline there and the Dynatrace net expansion rate, we’re doing a great job of cross-selling and expanding the platform in our existing customers. So a combination across the board. And maybe just one more for me on that net new logo focus and sort of the specificity on the target there. Did you introduce any changes in the sales compensation to preferentially encourage them a bit more on net new logo, or is it more just sort of strategic, hey, this is where you want you guys to be focused? Any color there would be helpful as well. And that’s it for me. Thanks. Yes, this is John. Thanks, Jennifer. There’s no real changes year-to-year on sort of new logo incentive. We do have an incentive for sales to continue to drive new logos. We’ve had such a fantastic platform for built-in expansion. And so, for the last couple of years, we’ve had that new logo incentive to sell [ph] and the balance seems to be working. And as Kevin said, based on sort of pipelines and what we see in our sales cycles, we’re quite confident in that new logo growth again this year. Great. Thank you. And your next call comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Great. Thank you so much guys for taking the question. I just got a couple. One, and I know you mentioned this in your initial comments about back to basics, but just wondering versus the start of the quarter which was obviously a period of great uncertainty, not that we’re fully out of the woods yet, but what are conversations like today? And then also from a lead-gen perspective I guess a little bit following up on kind of what Jen was asking with new logos. What have you done differently in this new environment of no travel to generate new logo demand? And kind of how have the conversations evolved, meaning are customers becoming – were they way more hesitant in the beginning of the quarter and now things are starting to progress back to where you feel like pipeline build is kind of on pace with what it was prior? I don’t know, if you can share any thoughts on those, that would be great? Thank you. Sure. Heather. So what happened at the beginning of the quarter and this is not unexpected. I think many of the folks wrote about this, maybe yourself as well, that in the disruption of everybody scrambling to work from home and the scrutiny around which projects were going to rise as essential and which ones were going to fall as non-essential, that process took several weeks out of the quarter. And so we anticipated that. We pivoted to what makes a ton of sense, of course, which is who would take care of your base. So back to the base was a key part of our – early part of Q1. It served us extremely well and we generated a number of new logos as well as a very strong new logo pipeline for the balance of the year. The conversations have really only changed in the discussion around why is this project essential, Mr. Customer, or around Dynatrace is an essential part of your digital transformation, let’s discuss how, where and how we can expand the value of the platform for you. So it’s just centered maybe a little bit differently from the standpoint of it’s not just a project, it’s an essential project for digital transformation, so more pointed if that makes sense. On the new logo front, what we’re seeing there again is a pretty clear conversation that cuts to the quick immediately which is around that sort of essential nature of the project. If it’s not essential, nobody wants to spend time on it. If it’s essential, it actually moves more effectively or sort of more predictably through the sales cycle because it had to be blessed early by the higher-up management that this program would be essential. So we’re seeing that dynamic in the new logos which is actually very helpful. And as I said before, we have that – we’re blessed with being in a category that when times get tough, people turn to their applications. They turn to their digital transformations. They turn to sort of that digital side of their business where they can get closer to customers, they can be more agile, they can save cost and they can drive new revenue streams. And we’re essential to that movement and a nice place to be. Thanks so much. Your next question comes from Sterling with JPMorgan. Thanks. Hi, guys. Actually I want to circle all the way back to Matt Hedberg’s question. One of the things that is a frequent topic of conversation with investors is the idea of that Gartner report talking about 5% of applications are currently monitored and I think investors are trying to get a handle on with the digital transformation, where does that percentage go to? And obviously based on your qualitative comments, the answer is higher. But is there any sense as you’re seeing that shift to the cloud, does that 5% of apps become 50 or 25 or just any qualitative commentary around that would be helpful? Sure, Sterling. The shift to the cloud actually has an interesting dynamic with it. In the sort of siloed world of the data center where you’ve had different applications on different stacks of hardware connected by physical networks and now it’s all moved to sort of a virtual pool of resources, there are many more applications and services that are involved in a digital business than ever before. So we’re seeing customers want to take their sort of application, monitoring and observability up into the 60% plus of applications, all Tier 1, most of Tier 2 and even into some Tier 3 zones. So it is increasing with the cloud and it’s just a dynamic of how the cloud sort of operates and how the services become interconnected in the cloud. So as companies do digitally transform, there continues to be application expansion for sure. But I also don’t want you to think that the only expansion that we’re doing is because of the application layers. We’re actually starting to get much stronger in the cross-selling across the non-application hosts and services as well as more and more sort of extensions into digital experience and digital business analytics. And those are super valuable. I gave the example of an airline. It was really the user experience and the connection with digital KPIs that drove that opportunity from just why should I replace my current monitoring systems. It’s because it wasn’t helping with digital outcomes that were critical of course over the last few months. And so it’s that sort of comprehensive platform capability across all these modules and how they work together in a unified platform on Dynatrace that really is a key to why we believe we could raise that net expansion rate back up to 120% plus and continue that for the foreseeable future. Very helpful. Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with BAML. Hi. Good morning. Congratulations. I was wondering if you could give us some metrics that would represent the monitoring side of the business versus the AMP side. And if the TAM’s really that large and obviously you have the metrics to prove that and you have net new logos that you’ve guided to be very positive, you net expansion rate is running quite high, your win rates in the monitoring space seem to be quite high, why would the company not reconsider raising its longer-term growth forecast because you’ve after all been very successful in a brand new market? That is one. And secondly, if you can give us a little more commentary on the replacement of legacy monitoring logos, what exactly is happening there and why are you winning there, that would be great? Thank you so much. Sure. Let me try to parse those questions a little bit. So the first one just regarding sort of metrics between APM and sort of the cross-sell, I think last quarter I talked about 25% of our growing customer base using three plus modules, which is really sort of those are the platform customers and ones that have really moved themselves from sort of tool thinking to platform thinking. And I just gave another stat that over the last six months, it’s actually increased 44%. So just to share with the group here, our investment community, that the cross-selling that we’ve been talking about for the last year is taking off. And so think about us maybe as a – where a year ago we might have been an 80% APM and 20% emerging products, think of us as a 70% and 30% emerging products but also remember that the base of customers is expanding rapidly as well, all right. So maybe that gives you a little bit of color and I’m going to expect that trend to of course continue as we drive to sort of more and more platform customer usage over time. So I think that that’s key. The second one as far as growth rates, we’re pretty pleased with the growth rate that we have right now. If and when that moves up, we’ll continue to guide. But you’re going to find us to be relatively conservative company from a guidance standpoint, we think that’s a proper way to automate – I’m sorry, proper way to guide and we just think that’s prudent. Okay. And who are you winning the monitoring business against, to the legacy or the modern vendors, if you have any color there, that should be --? Right, sorry about that third piece there. It’s a combination of both, okay. So it’s actually an interesting dynamic. We’re seeing more and more movement to sort of what we called in the past greenfield. It’s where you sort of have a do-it-yourself approach taking over. No real incumbent because as people move to the cloud, they realize their prior investments in Gen 1 and Gen 2 tooling no longer works in dynamic multiclouds. And so that’s then in do-it-yourself world is starting to actually show up as an observability project world, okay. So we’re starting to see that new beginnings of that trend. That’s about 40% of what we see in the market and that’s up from about 30% a year ago. We don’t see an incumbent in our base. We have been clear that we still land on the application layer. It’s where we’re best known through that APM segment of what we call our APM module, and there it’s sort of the classic Gen 2 and Gen 1 competitors that are in that space. And as time goes on, our differentiation becomes much more valuable and our win rates continue to climb against all those competitors. And as I said, 60% of the engagements we enter into these days. Thank you, John. And your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Hi. That’s a new version. Thanks. Can I stay on that subject? So if you think about it, there are kind of initiatives out from a lot of different players around this and everyone’s coming from a different angle with new product announcements, et cetera. Like if you think from your perspective, what’s the main thing that people – that you think where you kind of have to lead and should kind of continue to strive, because you see like the logs guys, the infrastructure monitoring guys, all of them coming into the middle ground [ph] of observability. Like can you talk a little bit about the complexity of what you did over the last couple of years in terms of redoing the product and bringing it altogether under one umbrella? And then I have one follow up. Sure. So let me step back just quickly because our reinvention of our platform was not simply to bring together these observability data sources plus some other ones like topology code and some other data elements. That was part of it because we knew that the cloud required a different kind of observability than just layer by layer by layer. You had to see it as sort of a homogeneous whole, a unified whole. But we also built in automation and AI and that differentiation becomes more and more essential as IT and development organizations try to move faster with fewer resources than of course they would like to have in order to accomplish all the application and digital transformation needs that they’re being tasked with. So it really is a combination of that observability plus automation and plus AI that really set us apart from a differentiation standpoint as we attack the modern cloud market. So keep that in mind. When we look out and we see sort of this world that’s collapsing [ph] use cases where that other players see as well where they might be coming off with infrastructure alone, we still believe that that application layer or that application thinking that we bring is really pretty vital, because it’s applications where IT and the business connect. The underlying plumbing of a cloud stack is interesting to make sure that cloud platform’s working properly for the applications that run on it, but the connected tissue with the business is there in that application layer. And so when we think about going forward, we think about not just that connecting the plumbing with the application, we also think about user experience, business KPIs and the rest also connecting. And so it is that complete end-to-end stack of platform value components that really make a difference for us. So I think whether you take the airline example or whether you take the retailer example or you take the K-12 example that I gave, every one of those required a much more complete set of modules in order to solve their digital transformation efforts than just observability alone. Okay, yes, makes sense. Thanks for that. And then congratulations on bringing the leverage down. So now you’re at the level that is kind of like way well into kind of the normal range. How do you think about that trajectory going forward? Because it’s a classic case, obviously software doesn’t do a lot of that. But then if you do financial science, you just kind of realize, okay, well, it’s actually a decent level to carry and it’s also kind of a decent thing. How do you think about that going forward? Sure. So first of all, we’re super pleased with the progress we’ve made since IPO and well ahead of plan of actually delevering the company. In July, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we did paydown another $30 million of debt. Our debt balance is now about $480 million and a fairly low interest rate. And given our cash generation rating capabilities, our net leverage will be below zero in the very near future. If we think about sort of cash usage outside of that, I’d probably push that conversation out to our Analyst Day when we can talk about some of the areas where we can explore that cash usage and where we can put it to work. But for now, for the next couple of quarters, it’s certainly just focused on getting that leverage ratio down a little bit more. Okay, perfect. Congrats. Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Bhavan Suri. Hi, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here at the end and congrats, a really nice set of numbers. I guess I want to touch on two quick things. One, on sales force productivity. You had a part of sales force capacity sort of shift to Dynatrace platform and John you’ve talked about productivity improving and then sort of saying, okay, now we have capacity to go drive customer expansion which again you did really well to get to north of 120. How much do you think of that capacity is available for these new logo adds and how much do you think you have to ramp higher and sort of meet the customer target this year and then obviously kind of going into next year? Let me take that in a couple of pieces here. So the first one is that the sales capacity expansion or really general commercial expansion for us continues and that hasn’t stopped. It’s one of the things that we kept our foot on the gas throughout the early COVID period even in those times of uncertainty there. So that’s continued to scale. Some of that capacity that’s freeing up from conversions as well as being added to the business is helping us drive pipeline growth and sort of momentum in the business that Kevin talked about and has shared in our guidance here. So with some headwinds of course because of economic uncertainty in certain sectors of our business, which are more heavily impacted as well as certain geographies that have also been a little more impacted, I think that capacity growth is right now going to – sort of driving our current growth trajectory and not sort of propelling it one step beyond it. But I’m still really pleased with where we are from a growth standpoint. And as I said, it’s reflected in our guidance. I think that going forward just from an investment standpoint in the business, we talked about not only commercial expansion but also continued innovation expansion and I’ve shared some of that success we’re having with cross-selling, which of course comes with maturing of some of those additional modules. But I’m really excited to be able to share some of the plans ahead when we do our Investor Day in early September and I think you’ll also see some of what’s coming when we get to that point. So stay tuned and excited to share in a couple of months. Got it. And one quick one for you or Kevin and it’s something that’s starting to come up a little bit more, but what did you guys seen in '16 around the election, because you’ve obviously put out the new logo count out there which is new for all of us as a guide, but there’s always been this concern because spending slowdown or people postpone decisions kind of going into the election or post-election a little bit depending on results. And again, you guys went public in '16, but sort of what do you see, what do you expect, what are you hearing from customers around concerns around that or no concerns or hasn’t come up? I’d love to just get some color on how you’re thinking about what plays out, again not for the next few months, but soon as we get closer to November which is actually a few months, so yes, love to get that? Thank you. Sure. Whether it’s surveys that we read, like the one that we shared from Fortune or whether it’s actually direct conversations with customers, digital transformation is a long-term trend. It definitely transcends elections and it’s not something that’s going to – we can push one way or the other. It’s on a long-term macro trend trajectory. And that’s what we’re hearing and so that’s what gives us confidence. From a government standpoint, digital transformation is a critical part. Again, it’s a long-term trend. It’s beyond election year kind of spending and so I’m excited about our Fed opportunity as well which I highlighted in this earnings call, in particular. So we don’t see a real issue with elections because this really is an exciting long-term backward trend environment as businesses rebate themselves into digital businesses. Fair enough. And congrats on the Federal opportunity too. I’ll hop off. I know we’re running late. Thank you for taking my questions, guys, and congrats again. Great. Thank you. I appreciate it. Maybe I should with that sort of -- I think we can squeeze in one more. All right, one more question. Your final question comes from the line of David Hynes with Canaccord. Hi. Thanks, guys. I’ll keep it quick. So Kevin, maybe this one’s for you. As I think about the drivers of net expansion, what’s having a more significant impact? Are the follow-on deals getting larger or are they coming more frequently? In terms of net expansion, it really is a combination of both given the different verticals that we operate in. We are seeing footprint expansion happening more rapidly than we had seen over the last couple of years. We detect a little bit in the quarter in terms of just deploying something kind of a little bit again, but actually we had a healthy net expansion rate in the quarter. Then the second piece is in terms of the new logos – I’m sorry, I missed a fair piece of your question, David. No, I was just asking, are the follow-on deals getting larger, or are they coming more frequently, nothing about new logos. I think you hit on it as a combination of both. The size of the deals are staying fairly consistent I’d say, just becoming a little bit more rapid in terms of install and expansion in our customer base. Sure. And then, John, maybe a quick follow-up for you since you mentioned – said in the response to Bhavan there. Is there a common incumbent across the Federal environment? And just how do you think about the scope of the opportunity there? It’s a good question. It’s not dissimilar to the commercial market where there’s a number of incumbents, but then those who are more advanced in their cloud transformations are already seeing them fall away. So again, there’s do-it-yourself there as well that we enter in on and provide a platform to simplify that world and eliminate the disparate tooling challenges that you run into when you take that kind of do-it-yourself approach. So it’s really not that different. It’s just that they are big project based as opposed to commercial which moves a little bit faster. That’s why we hesitated our investment in U.S. Federal until about two years ago and now we’re investing aggressively because we see the U.S. government being much more active and much more purposeful in their digital transformation efforts. Perfect. That makes sense. Okay. Thanks, guys. Congrats on the continued momentum. And thank you everybody for joining us this morning. We’re excited about the business. We had a great start to our year and we look forward to sharing more with you both at our Investor Day and then again at our next earnings call in October. Thank you very much.

And with that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, John Van Siclen. John? Thanks, Noelle. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us on our Q2 fiscal 2021 earnings call. First, let me start by sharing how extremely pleased I am with the team’s ability to continue to navigate the prolonged remote work environment.
Productivity and attitude remained strong and we continue to add talent to the team at an accelerating rate. We had another strong quarter of balanced growth and profitability driven by a combination of new logo additions to the Dynatrace platform and the continued expansion of existing customers.
ARR for the quarter was up 33% year-on-year and subscription revenue was up 35%, resulting in a non-GAAP earnings of $0.18 per share. Based on the strength of our Q2 results and visibility into the back half of our fiscal year, we are raising our top and bottomline guidance for fiscal 2021, which Kevin will provide more details on shortly.
As discussed at our Investor Day last month, there are two macro trends driving our business. The first is the acceleration of digital transformation, and the second is the dynamic multiclouds are the platform of choice for these digital transformations, especially in the global 15,000 account base we target and serve.
Digital transformation is taking place around the globe and across every industry. We recently commissioned a study of 700 CIOs primarily from $1 billion plus enterprise companies and almost 90% of them agreed digital transformation has accelerated in the last 12 months and nearly 60% felt it will continue to accelerate into the future.
These are not just the well-known technology brand names you would typically consider when talking about digital transformation, these are retailers, financial service providers, manufacturing companies, public sector agencies and others who realize digital transformation is essential to the success of their businesses moving forward.
As digital transformation accelerates, so does the scale and complexity of dynamic multiclouds underpinning these programs. In the same study, 86% of CIOs said they are using modern architectures, which include cloud native technologies and platforms such as Kubernetes, microservices and containers.
As the use of these technologies grow rapidly, customers are seeing massive increases in complexity, dynamism and frequency of change. The volume, velocity and variety of data produced by these environments is growing exponentially, and the importance of these cloud ecosystems and the applications that run on them function flawlessly has never been greater.
And interestingly, of the CIOs surveyed, 63% now say that the complexity of their clouds has surpassed a human’s ability to manage them and 70% said their team is forced to spend too much time doing manual tasks that could be automated.
These trends are rapidly expanding the size of our market. As I shared at our Investor Day, our bottoms-up TAM for our targeted global 15,000 market segment has grown from $20 billion to $32 billion in just the past 18 months and we see no reason why TAM expansion should not continue in the markets and use cases we support.
With this rapidly expanding market, fueled by long-term macro trends as a backdrop, I’d like to make three points this morning, which I believe will help illustrate the sustainable growth opportunity we see ahead. First is that our platform approach to modern cloud observability is uniquely positioned for the customer segment we target and serve, the second is our ongoing investment and advances in go-to-market and commercial expansion, and third is the pace, scale and effectiveness of our continuous innovation engine.
Let me start with our simple yet powerful all-in-one platform approach. As many now know, as modern clouds get more dynamic and complex, the old approaches to monitoring failed. This realization has led to the rise of observability, as a new approach to a modern cloud world. Though we are in the early days of this movement, we are seeing three approaches to the observability opportunity.
The first is what we call do-it-yourself. We see this in a growing number of engagements. Company realizes their old tooling will not work. They begin to cobble together multiple quote-unquote modern tools, get an open source database and dashboard and software, and throw their best engineers on it to figure out how to regain visibility and control.
This seems easy at first, but to larger companies with diverse infrastructure needs, the growing number of cloud native applications and an increasing number of DevOps teams innovating more and more frequently, scale and complexity quickly proved this manual do-it-yourself approach to be unsustainable.
Second is a suite approach from a single vendor. Separate observability tools to gather metrics logs and traces each with their own silo data structure, loosely integrated, often with not much more than a dashboard UI and a query language to quote-unquote unify them.
The fact that all the tooling comes from a single vendor checks the boxes of tool and vendor consolidation, but it holds little advantage over the do-it-yourself approach. Customers still manually configure script, baseline, analyze, troubleshoot and so on, all very time consuming, resource intensive and unproductive in advancing digital transformations.
The third approach is the one Dynatrace subscribes to, a unified platform approach in which all data, matrix, logs, traces and in our case a lot more are unified in a common data model with proper context of dependencies and relationships.
We do all this automatically and we do it at massive scale. And what’s most important to note, is a data gathering and dash boarding are just a start for us. Through advanced analytics continuously applied in real-time, we had understanding, predictability and actionability on top. It’s here where customers regain time and leap ahead in efficiency, speed, innovation and lower cost. It’s here where they transform how they work.
We believe we are currently unique in a unified platform approach with sustainable advantages in automation and intelligence to make digital transformation easier and faster for our growing customer base.
In fact last quarter, we added 133 new logos to the platform, including Quest Diagnostics, Coles, Pfizer, Universal Music and Vail Resorts. And we continue to see nearly a third of our new land deals with three or more modules. A reason our landing ARR for customer is climbing. This brings us to nearly 2,600 customers on the Dynatrace platform and we are confident we can add 300 or more new customers in the second half of our fiscal year.
Along with healthy new logo growth, we expanded hundreds of customers as well. Application workloads are expanding in the majority of our customers clouds, many applications are scaling further than ever before, mobile user experience has been exploding for a growing number of customers and the cross-sell of our infrastructure module continues to gain momentum.
Not only was our net expansion rate above 120% for the 10th consecutive quarter, our ARR per customer climbed to $234,000, up 14% from a year ago. Our platform strategy in which adding a new module leverages the power of automation, advanced analytics and AI built into the core of our platform is gaining traction within our customer base and with our growing cloud partner network.
This brings me to the second topic I’d like to discuss, our commercial expansion, including the expanding role of cloud partners and technical alliances. We have talked about growing our sales organization at 20% to 25% this year and I am pleased to say we are on track. We continue to believe that our free trial-led direct sales approach is extremely well-suited for a modern highly differentiated offering targeted the global 15,000 largest companies around the world.
This said, we also believe that there is a growing place for regional and global cloud system integrators to provide leverage and reach. As digital transformation accelerates and more companies move from early simple cloud infrastructure to dynamic multicloud environments, cloud savvy system integrators are playing a larger role across a much wider set of companies in advising them through their digital transformation journeys.
As we continue to grow in both customer base and market awareness, cloud system integrators are embracing Dynatrace as a strategic piece in their go-to-market solutions. This is a big reason why we have launched our Cloud Partner Competency program to assure the expertise of our partners and the success of mutual customers.
In addition to cloud system integrators, we continue to lean into our cloud technology alliances with the three major hyperscalers, AWS, Azure and Google Cloud Platform, as well as other key platform players such as IBM Red Hat, VMware Tanzu and ServiceNow.
Our tight and broad technical integrations with these platforms and co-selling relationships broaden our market access by making it easier for customers to find Dynatrace and by aligning our joint sales teams to co-sell to enterprise clients. In addition, AWS, Azure and IBM customers can draw down their committed cloud spend to purchase Dynatrace, removing sales friction and accelerating close cycles.
A great example of our deepening relationship with these cloud alliance partners is our recently announced relationship with ServiceNow. With hundreds of customers and a growing set of cloud system integrators in common, such as Experian, Delta and DXC, we have seen an increasing opportunity to connect our platforms for expanded customer value.
For over a year, we have worked closely with ServiceNow to coordinate our cloud entity mapping, the Dynatrace Smartscape with the ServiceNow platform CMDB through a Dynatrace ServiceGraph Connector. This allows for both smarter ServiceNow workflows and change aware AI from Dynatrace.
We both see the opportunity to lead in the industry push to autonomous clouds, and together, we plan to bring our joint customers and partners in entirely new level of intelligent automation to save time, increase efficiency, reduce risk and accelerate transformational value.
We believe that this combination of an expanded free trial-led direct sales organization, combined with increasing leverage from a growing number of cloud partners is powerful and will drive solid new logo growth and ARR per customer expansion well into the future.
This brings me to the third topic I’d like to cover this morning, the strength of our innovation engine. As many of you know, we do the vast majority of our engineering work in Europe, Austria, Poland and Spain.
As a preferred employer, we are able to attract and retain fantastic talent and we combine this talent with an advanced DevOps, NoOps development process, delivering 25 major releases and hundreds of minor releases a year.
The combination is a steady stream of innovation across all modules and platform components continually. And with a hybrid SaaS platform tethered into all our customers, where their data is maintained in the cloud or behind the customer’s firewall.
Our customers adopt this steady stream of innovations and compatibility releases rapidly. Over 90% of whom run on a release no more than 30 days old. With the pace of change in modern cloud environments this rapid ongoing innovation model is an important advantage for us.
As we have discussed before and one of our bigger focuses this year has been the maturing of our infrastructure module. This past quarter alone we added over 150 new services across AWS, Azure and a growing number of GCP services.
We now have the widest hyperscaler service coverage in the market and they are all instrumented and gathered automatically, no targeting, no configuration, no scripting, truly automatic. This best-in-class coverage is a big reason for the expansion momentum this module is gaining in our portfolio.
In addition, we continue to invest and strengthen our leading digital experience monitoring module. This past quarter we advanced Davis AI to help digital teams automatically detect and understand the source of mobile application errors to speed remediation and enable continuous optimization. This is especially important as we have seen a 300% increase in mobile traffic over the past year, which has heightened since the pandemic.
Our real user monitoring that visually complete and session replay extensions is not only allowing digital teams to better understand end-user experiences and proactively handle customer care use cases, but is expanding into DevOps feature adoption and user behavior use cases as well. With over 70% of our customers using our DIMM module, we see continued steady expansion of this module well into the future as well.
And I am pleased that our ongoing innovation continues to garner analyst recognition. This past quarter Dynatrace earned the top spot in ISG’s cloud native observability quadrant and we also earned Gartner’s peer inside customer’s choice for application performance monitoring.
We are proud of this, of course, what was even more important to me is that I consistently hear the same from our customers that our technology leadership in modern cloud markets is strong, it’s advancing and it provides significant value at a critical time in the transformation journeys.
Having covered a lot here let me summarize. We have a leadership position in a massive fast growing market, given the shift from early cloud environments to dynamic multiclouds we believe the market is moving toward us.
Our lead and unified platform automation and intelligence sets us apart in observability today and will be a sustainable advantage for us as companies continue to modernize and advance our cloud platforms.
To take advantage of this technology and value lead, we continue to invest aggressively in commercial expansion, including the cloud partner leverage opportunity we see emerging. And we continue to advance our differentiation and add to our portfolio through a highly talented, highly efficient innovation engine that’s growing rapidly as well.
We like our organic approach as it enables a tighter, more unified platform, with quicker time to value, lower cost of ownership and easier collaboration than any alternative. We have multiple pillars driving sustainable advantage and we are investing aggressively across the Board to drive growth and leadership in this exciting market category.
With that, let me turn it over to Kevin for a deeper look into our financial results and guidance. Kevin? Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Today, I plan to review our strong Q2 results and then I will review our increased full year guidance and our outlook for the third quarter. As John mentioned, we delivered a great quarter on both the top and bottomline, delivering what we believe is a best-in-class combination of growth and profitability at scale. This is consistent with our goal to continue to deliver against the Rule 50. Annual recurring revenue was $638 million at the end of the quarter. That’s up 33% year-over-year, an increase of $158 million or $167 million on an as reported basis.
The two drivers of ARR growth are new logo customers and our net expansion rate. As we expected, we accelerated new logo additions this quarter adding 133 new logo customers in Q2 to finish the second quarter with 2,594 Dynatrace customers. This puts us on track to achieve our previously shared plan of about 530 new logos by the end of this fiscal year.
We continue to invest aggressively in expanding the functionality of our platform, broadening the use cases covered by our existing modules and expanding beyond the modules we offer today. This has led to a consistent net expansion rate, which remained over 120% for the 10th consecutive quarter. ARR per Dynatrace customer also increased to $234,000, up 14% year-over-year.
Moving on to revenue, total revenue for the second quarter was $168.6 million, $7.6 million above the high end of our guidance and representing an increase of 30% on a year-over-year basis. The strength in total revenue growth is being driven by 35% growth in subscription revenue, partially offset by the expected decline in Classic license revenue.
From a topline growth perspective, we are focused on driving subscription revenue, which makes up 94% of total revenue and is reflective of our ARR growth. As I mentioned during our Investor Day, we believe subscription revenue will increase as a percent of total revenue due to the compounding nature of the model, combined with the fact that we anticipate that more services work will be done through our cloud partners. As a result, we continue to view subscription revenue growth as the most important revenue metric.
With respect to margins, we continue to see an expansion in our gross margins as the subscription revenue mix increases combined with the way we manage our platform, as well as some cost savings related to the macro environment.
Total non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter was 85%, in line with last quarter and up approximately 2 percentage points from Q2 of last year.
Our non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $53.3 million, well above the high end of our guidance of $45 million, due to the revenue upside, gross margin expansion and our overall focus on operating an efficient business. This led to non-GAAP operating margin of 32%, up 9 percentage points from the second quarter of last year.
We are very pleased with this performance as it shows the operating leverage potential inherent in our business. However, we have consistently shared that we believe in a more balanced approach to operating the business, one that delivers strong performance on both the topline and bottomline.
Last quarter, I mentioned that we would begin to put programs in place to ramp our current level spend in targeted areas to support the long-term growth of the business. Many of these initiatives were in place by September, but given the timing of the investments within the quarter, the incremental increase in spend will be more prominent in Q3 with an additional step-up in Q4. This is reflected in the guidance that I will cover in a minute.
Non-GAAP net income was $52.6 million or $0.18 per share. As you will see in our press release, there was a tax adjustment of $7.5 million in the second quarter associated with the spend and reorganization, excluding this one-time item non-GAAP net income would have been $45.1 million or $0.16 per share, $0.06 above the high end of our guidance.
Turning to the balance sheet, as of September 30th, we had $248 million of cash. As I mentioned during our Investor Day, we expect to grow our cash position over the short- to mid-term, appropriate to support the scale of the business we are building, while we continue to reduce our debt and de-lever the business.
Our long-term debt was $481 million at the end of Q2. That’s down $30 million sequentially due to the principal repayment that we made early in the quarter. Following on our commitment to reduce our outstanding debt, we made a principal repayment of $30 million during October reducing our debt to about $451 million.
On trailing 12 month basis, our unlevered free cash flow was $154 million. As we had mentioned before, our cash flow is subject to seasonal variability tied to the timing of our bookings and renewals with our strongest cash generation occurring in the last quarter of our fiscal year. We continue to expect to deliver full year unlevered free cash flow margins of 29% to 30%.
Before I move the guidance, I’d like to call out that all references to growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted. Also, please note that with our global presence and European R&D footprint, we look at our business as generally hedged from a P&L perspective.
Over the last 12 months, we have seen two points of negative impact from currency and on top-line. We expect the mix of the business to drive an FX tailwind in the second half, which will essentially neutralize currency impact and revenue for the year. Our guidance continues to reflect these changes and should pose minimal risk to our outlook.
I’d also like to give a brief update on how COVID-19 is impacting our business. The highly affected industries we outlined in previous quarters, which represent about 20% of our business and include areas such as transportation, hospitality retail and energy continue to hold up well in Q2, as renewals of existing customers remain strong. Now more than ever, customers in all industries recognize the importance of digital transformation and the automation and intelligence that Dynatrace can deliver.
One of the great things about our business model is that it is resilient and predictable. With these attributes and our visibility into the pipeline, we feel confident about executing our plans. As a result, we are raising guidance for fiscal ‘21.
We are raising our ARR guidance to $721 million to $727 million, representing 25% to 26% growth. We are raising our total revenue to $668 million to $675 million, representing year-over-year growth of 22% to 24%. And we are raising our subscription revenue to $624 million to $630 million, representing year-over-year growth of 28% to 29%. For the full year, we expect non-GAAP operating income to be in a range of $186 million to $191 million and our non-GAAP EPS of $0.55 to $0.57 per share.
As discussed on prior calls and at our Investor Day, we are a growth company with a lot of runway ahead of us. We believe we are well-positioned to deliver against our goal of building a multi-billion dollar category leader.
As such, we plan to continue to accelerate investments to support ongoing platform innovation and commercial expansion efforts. Operating margins are expected to be very healthy in the second half of the fiscal year, but lower than Q2, which ran well ahead of our expectations primarily due to the strength of our revenue.
I would also note that we anticipate tax expense to be in the range of $6 million to $8 million in the back half. Our full year guidance includes an annual effective cash tax rate of approximately 8%, compared to our previous guidance of 11%. And to reiterate, we continue to expect unlevered free cash flow margins to be approximately 29% to 30%, resulting in $192 million to $200 million of unlevered free cash flow.
Turning to the third quarter, we expect total revenue to be in a range of $171 million to $173 million, representing the year-over-year growth of 18% to 20%. We expect Q3 subscription revenue to be in a range of $160.5 million to $162 million, representing the year-over-year growth of 24% to 25%. From a profit standpoint in Q3, we expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $43 million to $45 million, 25% to 26% of revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $0.12 per share to $0.13 per share.
In summary, we are very pleased with our second quarter performance and are committed to operating the business as a Rule 50 company. We believe Dynatrace’s financial profile is highly unique, including meaningful scale, strong growth, healthy profitability and cash flow.
With a large TAM in front of us and a market leading position, we believe the company continues to be very well-positioned to achieve our goal of becoming a multi-billion dollar category leader.
With that, we will take your questions. Operator? Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Bhavan Suri with William Blair. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats for the really solid set of numbers there. I guess, I wanted to touch really quickly on two pieces. One, a little more strategic about the TAM, so you obviously talked about the TAM, John, at the Analyst Day, but I guess as you look at the complexity what every company is going through in the digital transformation that even midsized companies going through, why not go below that sort of Fortune 15,000, why not sort of maybe move not to small businesses, but to midsize businesses that may have a service that may have a website and then -- more than a website, multiple applications, multiple products, how should we think about the idea of expanding down market to sort of even further increase the TAM that you serve? Bhavan, appreciate the question. So our focus has been and will remain for some time that Global 15,000. We believe we build products extremely well for that enterprise customer base, it’s a more complex environment, digital transformation matters to their business survival and it’s also where the profitability is as well. So we are pretty happy with a $32 billion TAM at this point. I should also say that… Understood. …that that nothing precludes us from going down market. There is no product issue. There is no pricing issue. There is nothing in that range. It’s more of a focus of the business and usually when you focus you accelerate faster in my experience. And that’s what I think you are seeing in our numbers. No. That’s helpful and I appreciate that. And then, I just want to touch a little bit on something you brought up a couple of times. So the digital experience piece you talked about 7% of customers being attached to it, you talked about strength in the log piece. Just some sense on sort of as these initial customers are -- the newer customers are landing, are you seeing them land with multiple products and what is the attach rate. Is there a pattern in the attach rate for some of the newer products with the new customers? Thank you. Another good question. And yes, we are seeing the attach rate of multiple modules with new customers increasing. So I think at our Analyst Day, we talked about 30% of new logo customers landing with three or more modules.
And I think what we are seeing and it’s starting to come through in our sales cycles and sales data is that, we are starting to see a gradual shift now. It’s still early days. It’s still small. But a gradual shift from sort of being APM landing zone we have talked about for the past year to an observability landing zone.
And that observability landing zone is almost by definition a platform kind of thinking where the customers are looking for a wider footprint of value day one. And we are very well-positioned for it. We have been anticipating it and we are starting to see it happened. Again, like I said, it’s early days, but it’s beginning. No. That’s great. Thanks for the color and thanks, John, for answering my question. Appreciate it, Bhavan. And your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Hey. Congrats from me as well. John, can you talk a little bit about, you mentioned about the increasing uptake for the infrastructure module. In terms of, like, where do you see customer understanding in terms of that module being kind of crucial and being a potential starting point for you going forward? And I had a follow-up for Kevin. Yes. Sure. The -- well, the infrastructure module, as you know, we have been working on it for the last 18 months to really mature it and it’s come into its own now. And that’s allowed us to be much more aggressive in the expansion side of it, as well as landing with that module alongside the APM module and the DIMM module.
From a like wide infrastructure module and log analytics from Dynatrace versus someone else, usually there is some kind of an incumbent in place a series of tools in place to cover that, what that module covers.
But when you start to consider that, all of the data gathering across all those infrastructure services is automatic. It’s all given context into our topology map, SmartScape, which maintains that map can continually in real time.
And then an AI engine that applies knowledge and algorithms across it to understand, where anomalies are happening that impact the business and immediately surface those to folks to take immediate action to proactively handle things before users are impacted.
You realize that the value of that platform that inherent automation and AI assistance is hugely valuable as you consider most of these enterprise IT teams are pretty much resource strapped these days in time and given them back time, given them back resource for more meaningful things like innovation and driving better business outcomes is huge.
So that’s what’s driving sort of that expansion of that infrastructure module and we are still early in it. I would say from a driving ARR standpoint, but the adoption is increasing rapidly within our customer base. Okay. Perfect. Okay. Thank you. That’s pretty clear. And Kevin, for you, if you think about the investments you guys are doing and John talked about the increase in the sales capacity. How do you think about this going forward, because in a way you are kind of moving from like a 20% grower into a 30% grower? So in theory there should be like an increase in needed hiring, as well as to kind of drive that further growth, but then also you have obviously productivity gains coming out of that. So, you mentioned already like a little bit of the investments, but how do you think about that in the medium-term to long-term here? Thank you. Sure. So I think if you take a look at our business model historically and go back to fiscal ‘20, really what we are trying to work on in the next two quarters is to get back to those types of margins and investment levels.
So if you look at our operating levels, our operating incomes were in the sort of a low 20%, 23%, 24% range and we had a step-up in Q1 and Q2 as a result of COVID and some pauses in investments and travel and things like that.
But what I will say is in September we made significant progress in terms of hiring, both from an innovation standpoint and the R&D area, as well as in sales organization as well, which we never took our foot off on the gas. So we are going to get margins down to that level. We have talked about that at Analyst Day.
And when we think about over the longer term, what we are trying to do is maintain as we communicated at Analyst Day, ARR growth north of 25% and continue to grow that top line. We want to balance that with investment so as we said. So we are going to step on the gas a little bit here in Q3 and Q4, because we think the market is there and the products there and there’s a lot of opportunity. Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Congratulations. Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Hey, guys. Good morning and I will offer my congrats again. This is certainly not an easy environment. You guys are doing well. John, on the call you noted cloud system integrators are becoming more important, which is really good to hear and similar to what we have picked up in our checks. Can you remind us what percentage of deals are either partner influence or maybe even partner-led, and perhaps, where that mix might go in several years? Sure. Yeah. So partner influence is still the lion’s share, which means your direct sales organization is doing sort of the finding and the development, and then run into the partners that help us sort of moved deals along or -- and that sort of thing. And what we are working on is, more partner source opportunities, which are starting to happen.
We have had a partner program as we said at Analyst Day for years, but this move from sort of boutique resellers of APM over to cloud system integrators you think of a wider platform that really sort of driving these digital transformations for customers. That is sort of the new opportunity for us.
We are still in the 10% of opportunities so to source through partners. I would say, cloud opportunity sourced through partners. But we see that capable of growing considerably. We see it up year-on-year consistently right now. And when it becomes a sort of a big push as it is for some other billion plus companies, we will start sharing more percentages and sort of what the pace is of that.
What I wanted to share today is that we are starting to see the movement. We are leaning into it. We are getting more aggressive with it and it will become a more meaningful sort of adjunct in our augmentation to our go-to-market. That’s great. And then, I wanted to -- sorry, it didn’t come up today, but it came up at Analyst Day, but I wanted to circle back on your intent to enter the application security market. It makes a lot of sense, I think, especially given SmartScape and your Davis technology. Can you talk a bit more about this opportunity, soon customers are asking for this from you and maybe remind us again about the timing of the launch here? Sure, Matt. So I figure I’d probably ought to stick with the modules that we have today rather than sort of preannounce anything. But as we did talk about on Investor Day, we have spent the last 18 months to 24 months looking at that security market.
We know we have a phenomenal data platform for that environment, especially for the dynamic multicloud environments that are out there, security, where you can’t ring fence it. You have to build it into the applications themselves. And so, as we get ready to add that capability, that module into our portfolio, we will make sure that we keep everybody abreast as we go. It’s not far away, but it’s not ready to be announced. Got it. Thanks, guys. And your next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe and Ms. Lowe, please state your company name. Okay. Thank you. This is Jen Lowe from UBS. Great. So I wanted to ask a little bit about the demand environment, and in particular, John at the outset you talked about this growing consensus that digital transformation is necessary and only more so in the current environment. But sometimes in our fieldwork we pick up that companies are conceptually on Board, but maybe a little reluctant to commit to very big transformational projects in an uncertain time. So it’s on their roadmap, but maybe not actually happening today, it’s more next year. I am just curious in that commentary what nuance is you are hearing in terms of those projects starting today versus being on the roadmap but maybe more 2021 business for when things get a little clearer on the macro outlook? Sure, Jen. Well, from our standpoint we are not what I would consider a massive digital transformation project. Someone’s already committed the digital transformation and they are trying to figure out how can I speed it up, how can I reduce risk in the project and how can I create greater efficiency lower costs while I am doing it. And it’s that combination of gaining speed reducing risk and driving efficiency that makes this a very practical kind of choice and pay for itself within a 12-month window.
So these aren’t projects over three years, four years and maybe I will get my payback over 10 years. They are much more practical than that. And I think that’s a secret to our success actually. That return on -- that rapid return on investment is quite clear and a number of customers experienced said they talk about it with their peers. Okay. Maybe one more for me. We have seen some of the other players around the observability space adjust their pricing or announce new pricing plans or focus on plans that are really designed to make it easier to bring in data at a low price point and get away from kind of a host based model. I am curious if that’s something that you are hearing from customers that they are asking for anything you think might be on your roadmap at some point? No. What we hear is customers want? At the enterprise level, they want predictability and they want transparency. They don’t want surprises of consumption based models where they are getting hit with overages month after month after month. They don’t like the idea of, hey, come in chief and then all of a sudden they would be surprised.
So our pricing model is built around use cases, the modules, you get pretty much everything you need within those modules and the value that they look at is not just in collecting data, they are actually with Dynatrace getting the understanding of the data. They are getting the predictability of where bottlenecks and issues are arising, so they can take action and they are getting a system with precision enough for them to actually build auto-remediations off them.
So it’s a different kind of value proposition than the, hey, I am just gathering data kind of value propositions and I think that our pricing model, which we adjust all the time by the way, as the market moves here and moves there is working extremely well for our -- to our enterprise customers and I don’t see really any reason to sort of change it at this point in time. Okay. Thank you so much. And your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Yeah. Thanks. Hi guys. John, in your prepared remarks, you kind of touched upon automation, the most advanced capabilities, which brings to mind AIOps at least from my thought. I am just kind of curious what is the penetration of those advanced automation AIOp capabilities at the moment inside the customer base and what kind of revenue run rate or spending uplift you get when customers go to that level? It’s a good question, Sterling. Built into the platform is the AIOps capability. So every Dynatrace customer enjoys it at some level. But how many actually take that from the Dynatrace platform and extended beyond it, is probably, I think, as we have been looking at sort of different environments were somewhere in the 10% to 20% range of customers extending beyond, some of them are pretty obvious ones, like connecting with a ServiceNow environment, other ones are sort of more much broader where they work on dozens and dozens of additional data sources pulled into the Davis AI for a much wider AIOps footprint.
The way we monetize that is we charge for ingestion of third-party data, data that doesn’t automatically come in via the one agent. It’s not a large amount of our revenue stream, but it’s becoming more meaningful over time.
But I think as we go you will see us do more and more work in a broader AIOps footprint. You saw that we were the number one choice in the ISG observability quadrant that was recently put together and you are going to see a few other things come up where it’s focused specifically on a AIOps where you will see us ranked quite high and sort of anticipate some of the moves we are going to make going forward here to be more aggressive in that growing market segment. And your next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Hi. Thank you. I wanted to try to ask two. First, I want to talk about or ask about the competitive landscape. And the small and medium business category in observability has been disrupted over the last probably two years, in particular New Relic with Datadog providing some disruption. I think one of the larger overhangs for your staff is concern around disruption. And so my question is if the SMB category within observability has been or faced increased competition. What can you say to investors about your spaces though I think the rock solid leader in enterprise? Why won’t that get disrupted over the next couple of years? And then I have a follow up. It’s already being disrupted. It’s just that we are the disrupter in that space. We are the ones that have been bringing modern observability to that enterprise segment for the last four years. We are the ones with the full-stack platform. We thought about it thoroughly that it was more than just the data that it was the understanding of the data, the predictability -- the predictive analytics, the ability to take action immediately, quickly, precisely. We are the disrupter in that space.
And what works in the SMB space, which is sort of a simpler, fewer application, less change kind of environment, gets very complicated when you get to the enterprise. So that’s my feeling there and that as folks try to move from SMB up to enterprise, it’s a pretty different world and we are already there. Yeah. Okay. Okay. The second question I had is on ARR growth. So you are guiding a growth in constant currency for the year of 25% to 26%, which is up from your previous guide and increased, and I should say, from your previous guidance. Your longer term guidance is as you say north of 25%, normally you see a de-sell over time, but what you are suggesting is, as you reach a level at the end of this year, it holds that. But why it’s just unusual to not see a de-sell so to speak. So if you could just speak to or address why you think you hold at those levels rather than see some perhaps tailing off below 25% longer term? Sure. So a couple things there. So the first thing I would say is, as we discussed again at Investor Day, we will be facing and we are currently facing some headwinds on our ARR growth due to the perpetual run-off of licenses and those as we discussed over the next four quarters to six quarters will be a headwind to ARR growth. Yeah. So, that sort of on the negative side and as we come out of fiscal ‘22, those headwinds to ARR growth will disappear. However, if you think about the investments that we are making today that was -- that’s what makes us very optimistic about the future ARR and sustainable growth.
Our goal this year is to grow sales and sales capacity by 25%. We are on track to do that. Things are going very well from a sales standpoint there. We are also seeing a nice shift in our sales rep organization as well. We have a lot more mature reps than we did 12 months, 24 months ago. So that should provide a tailwind as well.
And I’d say the third thing is, we talked about before is, we are no longer working on converting our base from classic to the Dynatrace platform. So that gives frees up additional capacity. We talked about that probably around the 20% of free capacity. That over time should help productivity.
So you think about those three things combined sustainable growing sales capacity and maturing of the sales organization, as well as no longer working on conversion programs. Those should all be a tailwind to ARR growth over time. Perfect. Many thanks. And your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Hi. Thanks. Can you hear me? Hi, Walter. Hey. So just starting out, just on the 133 customers you added in the pipeline your building for the second half. Can you talk about the trial activity? How much of those are coming in through free trial or most coming in through the traditional sales motion where trials are not big -- not a big part of it? Almost everything involves a free trial, whether we stimulate the customer and suggests that they investigate that way or whether they have already investigated and done their homework and come in that way from their own investigation before we even touch them. The free trial accelerates the sales cycle no matter which way the customer comes in or the prospect comes in.
In fact, they also accelerates the expansion, because it’s an easy way for customers to pass on to their colleagues in other departments or other applications facts, here’s something you ought to look at and it accelerates that early investigation stage. So that’s why we call it sort of a frictionless enterprise kind of program, because that free trial is involved in almost every engagement. Got it. And then if we think about the 300 that you talked about for the second half. Can you help us understand, you talked in the past I think last quarter and two quarters ago about, there is some headwind from the macro and so forth. How much headwinds do you think you still face in adding somewhat around 300 customers. And do you think you have already converted or converted all your sales capacity to be able to add new customers. Do you think that 300 is still kind of work in progress and you would like to see improvements as you look into next year? Yeah. So, a couple of things. So there is no question that trying to build relationships with enterprise customers where it’s a more complex sale and usually multiple people involved in making decisions, it’s harder over Zoom than it is face-to-face.
At the same time, we are getting better at it, and customers are getting used to it. So they know they have to advance so they have to figure out a way to make that work and having a free trial and then being able to do proof-of-concepts remotely, 100% remotely, it’s a big advantage for us. The number of our competitors still can’t do that.
So we have learned a lot. Customers have learned a lot and we are starting to see the sales cycles move back to a normal cycle range. And that’s what gives us confidence in the second half of the year.
As we go into the future and things sort of normalize back again, I believe our muscle in driving new opportunity, we will continue to increase our productivity. We will increase per sales rep, if you want to think about it that way. And then we should see, continue to see increases year-over-year and keep a steady sort of percent of ARR as we go in that new account, new logo segment. Got it. Thanks. That’s good to hear, John. Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of T.J. Hynes [ph] with Canaccord. Hey. Thanks guys. Congrats on the results. John just one from me. So one of the questions I get from investors is they try and make sense of the competitive landscape, is whether it’s easier to expand from APM to infrastructure or from infrastructure to APM, right? And given your model, I know how you will answer the question. But maybe you could just talk about why you think that that’s the case? Well, so, first of all, we continue to believe that the application layer is the strategic layer of value. It’s where IT meets the business. A CEO doesn’t want to talk about infrastructure. They want to talk about business outcomes that are driven by business applications. So that’s sort of the first thing.
The second thing is, very few people have figured out how to do automatic application observability at scale. And in the cloud environment, that means you have to actually observe everything at once because it’s all virtualized software.
That’s a very difficult challenge. There’s hundreds and hundreds of compatibility idiosyncrasies with all the frameworks, all the layers, all the languages, et cetera. So that’s always been sort of that difficult barrier. Otherwise everybody be doing it and you would see dozens of people in the upper right quadrant of the Gartner APM Magic Quadrant.
So that said, our view is, infrastructure has its own peculiarities and uniquenesses, and it’s taken us, as I said, 18 months and then we still have more work to do to get our infrastructure module to a mature level in that segment. So no segment is easy.
But we view the Infrastructure segment as a logical extension that we are fully capable of addressing and one that goes hand in glove with the application layer, when you get to enterprise observability and the use cases and extensions thereof. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. That’s helpful color. Thanks guys. Thanks, T.J. I think we are sort of out of time. That was the last question. So let me just say thank you. We believe we have a fantastic opportunity in front of us with a massive market and a well-differentiated product. We have a great balanced business that you can see. We are going to continue to invest, as Kevin said, in commercial expansion and continuous innovation, which has served us well and we look forward to catching up again in late January, early February to cover our Q3 results. Thank you again. Enjoy your morning. And thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It’s now my pleasure to turn the call over to Noelle Faris, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Great. Thank you, operator and good morning everyone. With me on the call today are John Van Siclen, Chief Executive Officer and Kevin Burns, Chief Financial Officer.

A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP measures can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.
And with that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, John Van Siclen. John? Thanks, Noelle. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us on our Q3 fiscal 2021 earnings call. I am pleased to report that we had another strong quarter across all of our key operating metrics. ARR was $722 million, up 35% year-over-year. Subscription revenue was $170 million, up 33% year-over-year and un-levered free cash flow was $74 million bringing year-to-date un-levered free cash flow to $151 million or 30% of revenue. These strong results were driven by a solid combination of new logo additions to the Dynatrace platform, the continued expansion of existing customers in an inherently efficient business model.
Based on the strength of our Q3 results, we are raising our guidance across the Board for fiscal 2021, which Kevin will provide more details on shortly. There are three main factors driving our success in the market and ultimately resulting in our strong financial performance. The first is strong long-term market trends. Second, the investments we are making in go-to-market and commercial expansion are paying off. Third, our commitment to continuous innovation is solving a wider range of problems for our customers and keeping us well ahead of competition.
I will walk you through each of these factors and share why we believe they position us for sustained growth well into the future. First, long-term market trends continue to be in our favor. Companies around the globe and in every industry are undergoing digital transformations at an accelerated pace. And these transformations are happening in dynamic multi-clouds, which leverage continuously changing container and micro-service architectures. We saw many examples of this during last quarter, such as the large energy provider in the U.S. digitally transforming to a Tanzu hybrid cloud platform to stop coal use and reduce CO2 emissions by 70% over the next 10 years, all while delivering smart home energy services to their millions of consumers. Our large brick-and-mortar retailer rapidly transforming to an OpenShift Kubernetes platform to drive omni-channel engagement new curbside services and new revenue streams like accepting and processing Amazon returns in state governments and pharmacy chains using DevOps and cloud native application platforms to rapidly rollout online vaccine information scheduling and tracking services. All these and more are powered by Dynatrace to enable greater speed, agility and efficiency sought by CIOs and CTOs today as modern cloud complexity and scale stretches beyond their team’s ability to keep pace. Automation and intelligence contained this complexity free up resources and speed transformation, are becoming requirements.
One of our banking customers recently told me that Dynatrace has been “killer app” behind their digital transformation adding value and automation across a wide variety of bank services, applications and IT used cases. We heard from a new healthcare customer who had been struggling to get a Gen2 observability solution deployed that Dynatrace has been “a knockout” deployed over a weekend, providing value across their cloud environment immediately. And a large government customer recently integrated us with ServiceNow and has reported dramatically reduced incident response times with several recurring issues cutting them from hours to seconds. We invested early in automation and intelligence capabilities to allow digital transformers to do more with less to gain time for innovation and business advantage and those investments continue to give us a well differentiated advantage as market trends move in our favor.
Having a well differentiated solution in a rapidly growing market brings me to the second factor driving our success in strong financial performance. And that is our step up in strategic go-to-market and commercial expansion investments. We are doubling down in several key areas to take advantage of the market momentum and opportunity. We have talked about growing our sales organization at 20% to 25% this year and Q3 results showed that these investments are paying off. We added 189 new logos this past quarter back above pre-pandemic levels. New logo wins were across a diverse set of industries, geographies and government agencies, including Hyundai, Edward Jones & Company, the Texas Department of Health, EchoStar and Denmark Radio. The value advantages enabled by the advanced automation and intelligence of our platform are resonating with customers, whether they are replacing APM solutions, transitioning to observability platforms, or challenged with a tool fatigue of do-it-yourself approaches, we are winning new logos in all scenarios.
In addition, we maintained a net expansion rate above 120% for the 11th consecutive quarter. Expansion deals were equally diverse, including enterprises such as Santander Bank, Publix Super Markets, 3M, and the Department of Works and Pension in the UK. Upselling our market leading APM module to support more applications and workloads continues to fuel the majority of our expansions. At the same time, cross-selling continues to gain strength with 33% of our customers now using three plus modules, up from 24% a year ago and nearly 40% are now using our infrastructure module for non full-stack workloads that support their cloud operations, such as directories, firewalls, load balancers and more. We are seeing a steady rise in customers leveraging the value of our platform for new and expanded use cases and automations as they digitally transform.
Given the solid execution of our sales team and momentum in the market, we are now planning to accelerate the growth rate, our primary quota-carrying reps into the 25% to 30% range. We have kept our foot on the gas throughout the pandemic and are now scaling up commercial expansion to capture greater share and drive continued strong growth. And while our direct sales force is responsible for a majority of our business today, we know there is an opportunity to grow faster by expanding our leverage and reach through cloud partners. Over the past couple of quarters, we have been focused on expanding our tech alliances with the three major hyper scalars, AWS, Microsoft and Google. As you know, we have had a longstanding and close relationship with AWS as a premier partner and continue to scale this out.
And I am pleased with the progress we made to advance our Google Cloud platform and Microsoft as your relationships. First, with Google Cloud platform, we have expanded our strategic partnership to include go-to-market collaboration with joint marketing efforts and a unified go-to-market motion, with sales incentives for both teams. In addition, we have streamlined contracts and procurement processes by allowing Dynatrace purchases to flow through the GCP marketplace and be applied against GCP pre-committed spend. Second, we have enhanced our partnership with Microsoft Azure as well. Similar to our longstanding relationship with AWS and in line with our expanded relationship with Google, we have expanded our collective go-to-market motion and co-selling arrangements and we are actively enhancing our frictionless buying experience through Microsoft Azure’s console integration.
We are very pleased with these strengthened strategic cloud partnerships. And today, we believe we are the only observability platform whose customers can use their committed spend through private offers in all three marketplaces. Private offerings in the marketplaces are the preferred cloud buying mechanism for many enterprises. And this allows our customers the flexibility to choose where to deploy Dynatrace and do it easily and efficiently. Before I leave go-to-market investments, let me add a comment on our annual user conference, Perform, which is coming up next week. This year, we are expecting over 20,000 registered attendees, that’s 10x more than we had for the physical event last year. Certainly, the shift to a virtual event is driving attendance up, but so is the awareness of Dynatrace in the market and the unique benefits of our platform. We are excited to be reaching such a broad global audience, many of whom are prospective customers within our target global 15,000 enterprise accounts.
Now, to the third factor driving our success and strong financial performance and that is our continuous innovation. Our highly talented product team listens intently to our customers and turns these insights into a continuous stream of innovation to advance our differentiation and increase our value advantage. Last quarter, we released the fourth generation of our patented PurePath distributed tracing technology. PurePath 4 now provides the deepest, most complete and fully automatic distributed tracing for modern cloud environments, including those extended with open telemetry and open trace. As modern cloud applications become more dynamic, the increase in scale and exploding complexity advanced levels of distributed tracing are required for precise understanding and immediate actionability for troubleshooting, optimization and proactive remediation use cases.
In December, we announced our entry into the cloud application security market. As we did with cloud observability, we are leveraging the disruptive forces of modern dynamic clouds to enter this market, targeting where the puck is going as modern cloud DevOps processes accelerate innovation and change and cloud native applications sprawl across multi-clouds. There is a growing friction between the speed of innovation and traditional security approaches. Leveraging the power and intelligence of our platform, our new offering solves this challenge to advance DevSecOps for Kubernetes orchestrated cloud native applications. As we said when announced, it will take time for customers to test and validate this new offering. So, the ARR impact will be slow at first, but we believe this new offering has the potential to expand our TAM by $18 billion over time, bringing our total addressable market opportunity to over $50 billion. Both PurePath 4 and cloud applications security are exciting advances for us. And with our annual Perform conference around the corner, you can expect more innovation announcements to come.
Before I summarize, I would like to take a minute to touch on the maturing of Dynatrace as an independent public company. As we look forward to our next phase of growth, we continued to enhance our board and board leadership. I am very pleased to announce that Jill Ward has been appointed Chair of the Dynatrace board. Jill has been a strong voice of leadership on our board since 2019 and brings extensive knowledge and experience from her work at a number of remarkable companies. For more details, please refer to the press release we issued earlier today.
Now, let me summarize as I’ve covered a lot this morning. As I said at the outset, we are very pleased with our performance this quarter and it sets us up to finish fiscal 2021 quite strong. I want to thank our global team of almost 2,700 employees for all their hard work and contributions in helping us achieve the success. We continue to prove that we are well-positioned in the growth market and that our innovation engine can consistently differentiate our solutions and expand our market opportunity. Likewise, we continue to see returns on our investments in go-to-market and commercial expansion, which are driving pipeline momentum and growth. Sales execution is strong. Our partner engine is revving up and we are investing. Add to this the growing awareness of and interest in Dynatrace with a reputation for world class product and expertise for modern cloud based digital transformations and we believe we have the ingredients for strong and sustained growth.
With that, let me turn the call over to Kevin for a deeper review of our financials. Kevin? Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us on our Q3 earnings call. As John mentioned, we delivered a great quarter across the board driven by strong ARR performance, which was well above our internal expectations. We believe ARR is the key performance indicator of the overall strength and health of the business. ARR in the third quarter was $722 million, that’s up $188 million representing 35% year-over-year growth or 32% in constant currency. We are extremely pleased with the rate and pace of our ARR growth and it is even more impressive when you take into account the headwinds related to the perpetual license roll-off and COVID-related impacts. With respect to the perpetual license headwind and as a reminder, when we sold a Dynatrace perpetual license, we would recognize the license revenue ratably over 3 years. About 2 years ago, we removed perpetual license agreements from our price book and they were sold on an exception basis only.
As a result, we had begun to see the wind down of these perpetual license agreements, which negatively impacted ARR by roughly $8 million in the third quarter, representing a little more than 1.5 percentage points of headwind to the ARR growth rate in the quarter. So, excluding the perp license headwind, our adjusted ARR grew 37% on an as reported basis and 33% on a constant currency basis. Additionally, roughly 20% of our ARR is with enterprise customers we consider to be an industry that are facing headwinds due to the COVID crisis, such as travel, hospitality and automotive. And while we haven’t seen these customers churn from the platform, their net expansion rates are below the average net expansion rate for the business as a whole. We are starting to see the net expansion rates for this cohort tick back up in the third quarter with expansion deals in retail, automotive and oil and gas verticals. This is a promising time resulting in an ARR headwind that was roughly half to 300 to 400 basis point headwind that we experienced last quarter.
As we have discussed, the building blocks for ARR growth are new logos and net expansion rate. As John mentioned, we continue to see an acceleration in new customers, adding 189 new logos in Q3, which is 9 percentage points higher than the 174 new logos we added in Q3 of last year. We expect that growth rate to accelerate further in Q4, putting us on track to overachieve our previously shared plans of roughly 530 new logos by the end of the fiscal year. As a reminder, we had 145 new logos in Q4 of last year. We exited the third quarter with 2,794 Dynatrace customers. Our net expansion rate was above 120% for the 11th consecutive quarter and our ARR per Dynatrace customer increased approximately 20% year-over-year to $251,000. Our average ARR per customer with three or more modules continues to increase as well. As John mentioned, this cohort represented 33% of our customers in the third quarter, up from 24% last year, with an average ARR of more than $400,000. As more and more customers adopt the platform approach, we continue to believe the average ARR per enterprise customer could be north of $1 million.
Moving on to revenue, total revenue for the third quarter was $183 million, $10 million above the high end of our guidance and representing an increase of 28% on a year-over-year basis or 25% in constant currency. The strength in total revenue growth is being driven by 33% growth in subscription revenue or 30% in constant currency. Overall, revenue came in well above our guidance due to some FX tailwinds, but more importantly, we saw strength in all areas, including new bookings, strong linearity and solid retention rates that drove revenue and ARR outperformance.
With respect to margins, total non-GAAP gross margin for the third quarter was 85%, in line with last quarter and up over 1 percentage points from Q3 of last year. Our non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter was $53 million, $8 million above the high-end of our guidance to do the revenue and associated gross margin upside. This led to a non-GAAP operating margin of 29%, up 3 percentage points from the third quarter of last year. We are very pleased with this performance as it shows the operating leverage potential inherent in our business. However, we have shared that we believe in a balanced approach to operating the business, one that delivers strong and durable performance on both the top line and bottom line.
Last quarter, I mentioned our strategy to accelerate investments in targeted areas to support the long-term growth of the business. Many of these initiatives were in place in Q3 resulting in a sequential increase of $12 million in non-GAAP operating expense, with R&D increasing 5% and sales and marketing increasing 16% sequentially. Looking forward, we expect another step up in investments in the fourth quarter and this is reflected in the guidance that I will cover in a moment. From a profit standpoint, non-GAAP net income was $48 million or $0.17 per share.
Turning to the balance sheet as of December 31, we had $300 million of cash, an increase of $111 million compared to the same period last year. Our ability to generate cash while investing in the business remains strong. Our long-term debt was $451 million at the end of Q3, that’s down $89 million over the third quarter of last year and $30 million sequentially due to a principal repayment that we made early in the quarter. As we have shared in the past, we are committed to reducing our outstanding debt and improving our leverage ratio. At the end of the third quarter, our leverage ratio was well below 1x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. We made an additional repayment of $16 million during the month of January, further reducing our debt balance to approximately $391 million. Through January of ‘21, our principal repayments have totaled $120 million in the current fiscal year. Our unlevered free cash flow for Q3 was very healthy at $74 million. On a trailing 12-month basis, our unlevered free cash flow was $215 million or 33% of the trailing 12-month revenue. This margin level is above our previous annual guidance of 29% to 30% due to a combination of the health of the top line, COVID related cost savings, and a tax refund that was more favorable than our original estimates.
Turning to our guidance, ARR is expected to be between $756 million and $760 million, up 32% to 33% year-over-year or 29% in constant currency. Our ARR guidance assumes approximately $16 million in perpetual license roll-off while roughly 3 percentage points of headwind to growth. Excluding the perpetual license headwinds, our adjusted ARR growth rate is expected to be roughly 32% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. For the fourth quarter, we expect total revenue to be between $190 million to $192 million, up 26% to 28% year-over-year or 23% to 24% in constant currency. Subscription revenue is expected to be between $178 million and $180 million, up 32% to 33% year-over-year, or 28% to 29% in constant currency.
From a profit standpoint, non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $44 million and $46 million, 23% to 24% of revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $0.13 to $0.14 per share. This EPS guidance assumes cash taxes paid of $3 million in the fourth quarter, resulting in an annual effective cash tax rate of approximately 7% for the fiscal year in line with previous guidance. Total revenue for the full year is expected to be $697 million to $699 million, up 28% year-over-year, 27% in constant currency. Underlying that, subscription revenue is expected to be between $650 million and $652 million, up 33% to 34% year-over-year or 32% in constant currency.
Moving down the P&L, we expect full year non-GAAP operating income to be between $202 million and $204 million and non-GAAP EPS of $0.61 to $0.62 per share. We are raising our unlevered free cash flow margin guidance to approximately 32% of fiscal ‘21 revenue. That’s 2 percentage points above the high-end of our previous guidance due to the top line strength of the business combined with COVID-related cost savings as well as a favorable tax refund of approximately $10 million first our original guidance. This full year guidance assumes operating margin leverage of roughly 5 points compared to last year due to a strong business performance and COVID-related cost savings.
As I mentioned at our Investor Day and since then we are committed to investing for the long-term. We expect to increase our sales and marketing and R&D spend as a percent of revenue. As a result of these strategic investments coupled with a return to a more normal level of employee spend, we expect the operating margins will return to pre-pandemic levels over the next year.
In summary, we are very pleased with our third quarter performance with strong ARR and top line growth, healthy profitability and a proven ability to generate strong cash margins. We believe our unique platform approach will continue to drive new customers to the Dynatrace platform and our innovation engine will continue to power our net expansion rate. These building blocks provide us with the confidence for sustained growth as we move forward.
And with that, John and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator? Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Great. Thanks for taking my questions and really strong third quarter here. John, I wanted to ask you about the expanded GCP partnership. Obviously, you guys had a press release a little bit ago. But I am sort of curious can you talk about lessons learned from AWS? Obviously, they were sort of a bigger partner earlier? How did that partnership progress? I am just sort of trying to get a sense for how it might impact ARR? And then could you talk about the importance of really being the only observability platform with a private offering in all three public cloud marketplaces? Sure, Matt. Appreciate your comments. So, the GCP partnership is in the past, we have been focused on sort of the technical relationships making sure our products are automatic and simple to deploy in each of the various cloud environments. But we have seen over the last year, we are growing opportunity to enhance the go-to-market side with the hyperscalars as they start to draw more enterprise spend toward them with these pre-commits and that’s provided an opportunity for us to be more aggressive in this area and we see the GCP opportunity as a great one for us and number of our customers are either moving from another cloud to GCP or adding GCP as yet another cloud in their portfolio that they want to leverage for various workloads. So as we have seen that and as the Google Cloud platform folks are continuing to get more and more aggressive in the market, we saw an opportunity to jump ahead of competition and put this go-to-market relationship together in a meaningful way. And so with that, we have had a great relationship with AWS of course and then as well with Microsoft, the GCP addition really does allow our customers now the flexibility to deploy anywhere, run anywhere and do it easily, smoothly and efficiently as well as leveraging pre-commit spends to do so. So we are excited about the combination for sure. That’s super helpful. And then Kevin, I really do appreciate you calling out $8 million perpetual loan of headwind in Q3 and the $16 million expectation for Q4. I am sort of curious obviously this will continue on into next year and you haven’t guided full year next year. But can you talk about sort of the cadence of that run-off as we progress through fiscal ‘22? Sure. So for the last couple of quarters, meaning Q3, Q2, it was about 0.5 a little bit more than the 0.5 of headwind to ARR growth rate. And then in Q4, our guidance was about 2.7 points of headwind growth. And I think we will see that trend continue for the course of fiscal ‘22 or move up a little bit more on top of where we guided for Q4. So, I think a little bit over 3 points and then there is a pretty big cliff at the end of fiscal ‘22. So, we – there is not going to be a large percent of ARR remaining as perpetual license and it will be de minimis from fiscal ‘23. So, the headwind will diminish as we go out through the course of fiscal ‘22. Super helpful. Thanks a lot guys. Thank you. Your next question today is coming from Jennifer Lowe from UBS. Your line is now live. Great. Thank you. Maybe just to continue on that last question, if I look at the guidance for Q4 and there are a lot of puts and takes there around currency and the headwinds, but if I – from the model runoff, but if I back those out, it seems like the guidance implies very little deceleration in ARR growth on a constant currency adjusted basis relative to what we saw in Q3. So, if I put that in context, should we assume that sort of reflects easier comparisons versus the impact of COVID kicking in March of last year or are you sort of getting more optimistic about the growth in the business outside of those impacted industries, just any more context there would be helpful? Sure. I will start Jennifer and then John wants to add in if he can. And I think you are right, if you look at the numbers, the guidance implies 32% constant currency growth, excluding the perpetual license headwind, which is fairly consistent actually with Q3 where we ended 33%. And I think there is a lot of different factors that have given us optimism as we move forward in the business. If you look at the sales organization we have been talking about during that 20%, 25%. We are going to be setting that up. We are seeing some step-ups in productivity as people – as we have talked about in the last year, so wind down that conversion activity and focus on new logos and expansion. And we are seeing a nice maturity in sales organization as well. And when you lay on top of that investments we are making in marketing lead gen go-to-market there combined with the innovation, the comments we have made through the course of the year, all those different factors stepped up in the quarter that resulted in really healthy new logo numbers and healthy net expansion rate and we think those trends can continue as we move forward. Yes, I think that’s well said, Kevin. And the only thing I might add to that is we do continue to see at the enterprise level the $1 billion plus company level that the market is moving toward us. And we are seeing more and more evidence that the difference that we bring to the market with advanced automation and intelligence becoming requirements for the highly complex and high scale environments that these large companies have is really starting to resonate and payoff. And so that’s another factor that I would add, but – and I would say, yes, we are feeling optimistic about the business strong Q3 sets us up well for going forward. Great. And maybe just one more for me, you commented that 40% of customers were using the infrastructure only module. And I am curious when you get in the door with that offering, how broad do customers typically go on the infrastructure side? Are they – I mean, in theory, you could cover 100% of the enterprise on infrastructure, are you seeing those sort of wall-to-wall deployments yet or is it still sort of more contained around work environments or related to where they are using APM? Could you just add some more context on how broad that can go at this point? Sure. Yes. So first, just to clarify, all of the sort of APM module customers, which is still the majority that includes the infrastructure capabilities, but there are extensions that don’t require those kind of application workloads as I pointed out in the prepared remarks. We are seeing customers go wall-to-wall. It’s not a high percentage yet. So, the vast majority of plenty more infrastructure expansion they can do, but we are getting better at and customers are understanding the value of having sort of a single source of truth across a much wider footprint and the automation and intelligence leverage that gives their digital teams. So again, not only are more customers using that capability and exploring that capability, but they are also rolling it out in a broader way as we go, which is evidenced in our net expansion rate continuing to stay above 120%. Great. Thanks, guys. Thanks, Jen. Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Yes. Thanks, guys. Just one question from my side, just back on the partnerships, I think from the outsider’s view from the investors’ view, it’s kind of hard to delineate and differentiate some of the announcements that we have seen coming out of Datadog and yourselves. Is there a way to differentiate the partnerships that you have established within these public cloud providers and perhaps, what kind of impact you expect to see from them revenue vis-à-vis where else you have seen announced in the market? That’s – it can be a little bit difficult to parse of course. Each of these hyperscalars are going to play a little bit of Switzerland. So, that the advantages anyone appears to have is relatively fleeting, I would say. But I think the important thing to take away is this that Dynatrace has deep relationships with all three. We are a premium partner with all three. We have not only early access to technology to enable customers to benefit from tighter and tighter integrations with the marketplaces and various offerings, but also that the go-to-market which is becoming as I said earlier a bigger and bigger piece of these relationships as these hyperscalars aggregate enterprise spend. These are things that Dynatrace is at the front of and our customers expect us to be and the value that they received from them is greater efficiency and confidence that we are there with the most advanced services that these hyperscalars offer at the time they offer them. And I think that’s really the key takeaway is that we have the same relationships are better than anybody else in this marketplace. Thank you. Thank you. Your next question today is coming from Bhavan Suri from William Blair. Your line is now live. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Let me echo my congrats on the solid results and hope the snow isn’t too much of a disruption for you guys out there. We already had our share in Chicago. So, I guess let me just follow-up on Sterling’s question around partnerships, but not the webscale partnerships, but you have got a lot of other partnerships on service now. You have got system integrator partnerships, things like that. I guess John maybe help us think through the strategy of doubling down on sales vis-à-vis using the leverage or leveraging the partnerships to drive growth into new existing accounts or new accounts. How should we think about those investments? And is it still early that you are just going to double down on everything across the board? At some point, do we see a leverage of the partnerships play out where we don’t need to add sales headcount to do that? How have you guys thought about that? Great question. At the enterprise level, it’s a little bit different than maybe in the mid-market. At the enterprise level, especially when you have a platform, that’s quite different in its characteristics, like the Dynatrace platform is, it’s not just in observability, it includes the automation and AI to provide understandability, predictability and actionability all in one. We believe that a sales organization is required to do that. But at the same time, we definitely pickup acceleration in ramp time and acceleration to full productivity by having these kind of partnerships and that’s what’s giving us sort of the combination of grabbing up the partnership, seeing the return there at the same time, we are seeing the productivity improvements in sales has given us the confidence that we ought to continue to tap the gas on that sales front and step it up from the 20% to 25%, where we have been to the 25% to 30%, which is where we are headed right now. So, we are excited about the combination. We think it is that combination that at the enterprise level sets us apart and will help accelerate, as Kevin and I have talked about our ARR growth and continued momentum in the business. Got it, got it, got it. Helpful. And then – and just staying on the sales question for a second, any particular regions or verticals that you are adding on? Are you seeing increased adoption and I think you have talked about sort of retail coming back and hospitality coming back a little bit – sorry oil and gas coming back a little bit sort of post where as we get we see the light at the end of the tunnel for COVID. But as you think about adding the sales headcount, are there specific areas whether it’s like maybe crypto providers, I don’t know that you are seeing greater demand in for understanding and monitoring observability etcetera? It’s really not any specific area, Bhavan. It really is across the board, it’s just that digital transformation around the globe continues to accelerate. Everybody is turning into a software company. Everybody needs to make sure they manage that software extremely well flawlessly if they can and we just happen to have a phenomenal platform for those large more complex environments as you know. So, it really isn’t anything on that front. On the – let me add maybe a couple of thoughts as well and that is that we are getting to the size of the business where we are starting to verticalize in certain areas, which I think also has a little bit of opportunity to accelerate in it, certain geographies, certain verticals. And the second thing is we are seeing an uptick, especially in North America, in state and federal government business as we spend more time and invest more heavily in those areas as well, which we talked about earlier this year. Got it. Got it. Super helpful. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it for taking the questions. Thank you. Your next question is coming from [indiscernible] from Barclays. Your line is now live. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and I will add my congrats on the really solid quarter as well. So, my first question, John, so I was just wondering if you can help us understand the drivers for – maybe the relative proportion of sort of like what will drive the ARR per customer from a $0.25 million right now to $1 million that you have mentioned, right? Obviously, that’s the long-term, but as you go on the trajectory, do you think that the – it’s going to be more about obviously your penetration will maybe and so you have talked about application monitoring coverage doubling, you expect it to double over the next few years at the end at this day last year, right? Is that going to be a bigger driver you are looking for, do you think that you are interested in monitoring your cloud application security module, like they are going to mature enough and be a driver of [indiscernible] as much that, that will be a bigger contributor of that ARR per customer growth? So just wondering if you can help us give more color there? Sure, I’d love to. So first of all, it’s important to know that the 3-plus module, ASP or average ARR per customer is it’s substantially higher than the average. Average is around 250,000 and the 3-plus module cohort is well over 400,000. So, that’s the first thing make sure that you cross-sell. The second thing is that none of our customers are fully saturated on the application side, not even our very, very largest ones. So either the applications continue to grow or they continue to add to them. All of that is consumption based where you have a consumption based model and that means expansion on that, that application front alone is massive. And then you add to it entering new markets, I mean, we are super early in the cloud app security space, but I don’t think anybody questions how valuable that is and how much it’s being disrupted by the cloud. We are pretty good at getting the right, listening to customers that you are in and out as we go into a market. We have proven it multiple times now. And I think you are going to see it again in the cloud app security space. So you put those three together of continued up-sell opportunity with applications, great cross-sell opportunity with existing modules and then adding new capabilities, new modules to the platform and gives us a lot of confidence and running room to continue to drive solid sustainable growth for the long-term. Great. Thanks for the color. My follow-up question is for Kevin, so great to see that you guys are feeling confident enough to raise the expectations around how much the sales capacity is going to grow. But Kevin, if I go back to your sort of the mid to long-term ARR growth sort of like of what you gave us light of 25%, I am wondering if you can talk qualitatively as to if that moves as well given that the sales capacity is sort of like a higher sales capacity on most companies not to talk about that they would like to see sales efficiency and leverage in the model still. So, if 20%, 25% sales capacity has gone higher, they do our use of like baking in some expectations around the ARR growth in the mid to long-term? That’s it for my side guys. Thank you. Yes. No, if you think about the business and the building blocks of the business over time, obviously, sort of the inputs to that the first is productivity. I think under some of those are not just the 25% to 30% sales capacity growth that John talked about. But it’s also the fact that we do believe over time we can get higher productivity out of our sales organization as they mature and as they are no longer working on the conversions. So those are sort of underlying that. And then we talked about the building blocks to ARR growth, right? And those are two. It’s pretty straightforward, right. The first is the number of new logos that we can add to the franchise. Q3 we grew that 10% year-over-year, Q4, we said that skin back growth rate will accelerate and we have also talked about a 15% to 20% new logo growth as we move the business forward. We couple that with a 120% net expansion rate, you do the math and that ARR numbers is above that 25% long-term target that we talked about. So we are very optimistic about the business. A lot of things moved a lot across the board in the right direction this quarter, everything sort of stepped up. We are optimistic that that can continue as we move forward in the fourth quarter. I am not – we are not going to come off of our long-term numbers at this point that we look forward to updating you after our Q4 numbers and talk about the trajectory of the business coming to them. Thanks, guys. Thank you. Your next question is coming from Andrew Nowinski from D.A. Davidson. Your line is now live. Great. Thank you for taking the question and the nice quarter. I want to ask about the cloud application security solution, if you could just give us maybe any color around what you see as the competitive landscape in that market? And also, is that a different buyer that might be buying that solution when you go into an enterprise to cross-sell it? Great, great questions. So, what we found when we were doing our sort of due diligence before we even brought our product to market is just playing out as we talk to more and more customers now and additional proof-of-concepts that are underway. There is a first of all the folks with the pain are the same cloud application folks that we talked to today. They are the ones that are being throttled by the security teams and probably rightly so because the security teams need to make sure everything is locked down secure that runs and sprawls across these clouds. And the common way of doing this is to try to do code scan after code scan. The pre-production, of course, before things are deployed and then periodic, not continuous, but periodic, in production. And what the results are, are long lists of false positives. Only a few like very small number of actual vulnerabilities, but these development teams have to go to everything and triple check them. So, that slows innovation. And it’s not really what the development teams want to do, they want to innovate. And so we sort of – we saw that friction between the security requirements and the speed of DevOps by providing not only preproduction scanning, but continuous production scanning for vulnerabilities. And we have the intelligence in our platform that eliminates the false positives, I mean reduces the noise dramatically making the development teams much more efficient and obviously the speed of innovation and deployment much greater. So, that’s what’s playing out. We think it’s – we have a great opportunity. The feedback has been super positive. But like anything that’s enterprise grade, especially if it’s going to go through the security gauntlet, it’s going to take a little bit of time to validate and verify, but we are optimistic and excited about the first 90 days here or 60 days and we will be talking more about it, of course, as we go in the future. That’s great. Thank you. And then maybe just a follow-up to that as well, you had an integration with I believe SNCs, along the same DevOps line, which SNC just caught a very high valuation on their last round. So I am curious as to your views on where you think that partnership can go and how that helps you in that DevOps market? Yes, with SNC in a in the DevOps space? Yes. Yes. Well, they have a phenomenal vulnerability database. They also happen to have very good information for developers as to exactly how to remediate an issue. So, the combination of our continuous intelligent sort of vulnerability detection, combined with their database, which is what we leverage as well as their information for developers, is like a perfect combination for DevSecOps acceleration. So, they have been a great partner to work with. We are excited to have our systems sort of integrated together. We give them runtime sort of view and value and they give us some fantastic behind the scenes data to leverage. Thank you. Thank you. Your next question today is coming from David Hynes from Canaccord. Your line is now live. Hey, thanks guys and congrats on the results. Maybe I want to follow-up on the last question on the security front a little bit. Look, I realized how early it is and I am sure there is a bit of price discovery happening in the market now. But if you think like looking forward, how much of an uplift to spend, could the adoption of security be right? I mean, if you have the average customer spending 250 grand with you, is it a 10% uplift 20% like more like any frame of reference there would be helpful as we think about the opportunity? So, our plans include multiple different kind of capabilities in the – for this module, this first capability, the vulnerability detection we think is a 10% to 20% uplift. But there is no reason that based on the plans we have and what we think we can bring to market that our app security module can’t be dollar to dollar with the APM module. I mean, the value is significant obviously and it’s the kind of solution that gets rolled out in a very broad way, not in a piecemeal way once it’s proven. So anyway, that’s – those are some of the thoughts behind why invest in this versus something else? Not only is it great disruptive moment, but it’s also something we think we can continue to build on and really have a significant ARR impact over time. Yes, yes. Makes sense. And then maybe just a higher level question that kind of gets at the triggers for expansion, I think looking backwards right over the last couple of years like the migration of the new platform was a great opportunity for you guys to get in there and get bigger right. Now that we are past that like what’s typically the catalyst for expansion in the base, right? Is it just the digital transformation initiatives that you are seeing? Is it new products trigger conversation? Is it just happened at renewals like help us like what’s the process and speak to that maybe in the context of sustainability of that 120 plus net dollar expansion? Sure. Well, so, really is the couple of different motions, the first one land and expand motion. The landing zone hasn’t changed much. But what’s happening is more and more companies are hitting what we call the microservices ball where the dynamic complexity at the application level gets so great and that blind spots are vast and sort of massive gaps in observability when it comes to sort of multi-app portfolios and large scale environments. And there is nothing like Dynatrace in those environments and more and more companies are finding that there are alternative solutions whether they were a Gen-2 APM solution, whether they thought they could do it with an infrastructure approach and maybe that would be enough or whether they are trying to throw a bag of tools at it, open source tools at it, I mean all of those are falling short at the enterprise level. So that’s helping us land new logos faster as well as bring new reps up to speed more quickly.
On the expansion front, like I said, everybody is putting more workloads on these clouds as fast as they can rewrite the old apps or add new apps, everyone is doing it. DevOps is a fantastic thing, because companies can move faster at the same time, lots of new workloads and services going out in production that need to be observed, observed, understood, troubleshot, optimized etcetera. And then the cross-sell is just natural for our customers once they get the hang of how a platform works. That’s earlier days as we have talked about, but it’s catching on, people are getting the hang of see if I have automation and intelligence, why wouldn’t I want more of it across the broader footprint of my infrastructure and services. So, I think it’s really the combination of all three of those that are driving the momentum and that’s why we are stepping things up whether it’s on the partner front or the sales front. That makes sense. Thanks and congrats. Thank you. Thank you. Your final question today is coming from Walter Pritchard from Citi. Your line is now live. Hi, thanks. Just a follow-up on last – on a couple of questions here. Around the sales organization, you are taking on more partners, you have got the security, go-to-market which is a little bit of a different buyer and then you continue to rapidly expand the size of the sales force stepping up that hiring rate as you talked about. Can you help us understand as we move into fiscal ‘22 any structural changes or any sort of evolutions you are making to the sales force to enable you to sort of keep up this pace of growth and these new initiatives that you have articulated? Yes, no great question, Walter. We plan our sales superstructure pretty well ahead. So, I think on the direct sales front, we are in pretty good shape, nothing too dramatic. I mentioned a little bit around some vertical focuses. We are doubling down in state and federal in North America, couple of things like that, that are obvious and smart expansions I think. We are expanding our partner team both on the tech alliance side and on the cloud system integrators. So, that continues under the hood. We talked about that a little bit before. And then, we have really stepped up our marketing efforts. We don’t talk about that quite as much, but the entire organizational structure there and sort of program and program management there toward digital as opposed to physical has been a big shift for us over the last 12 months. So, all those pieces are in place and we are really just stepping up on what’s in place and expanding across a number of areas, but nothing sort of dramatic that we have to do – that we have to prove out, it’s just more of step on the gas and build on what we have going right now. It’s a lot easier. And then just in terms of where you are getting sales people as you look towards that acceleration, is there any sort of bend you are making in types of people you are hiring as you look at the future versus the last couple of years? Not a lot of changes. I think if anything, we are spending more time sort of going to adjacent infrastructure spaces as opposed to try to find people with performance or performance or infrastructure monitoring kinds of backgrounds, we find there is some bad habits there. So, we like to train folks new and we are doing a really good job now I think of finding better talent, people not looking for work, but having a reputation for being a fantastic company to work for especially on the sales front. And I think that’s helping us with talent, acquisition, reducing turnover. And as Kevin said, it’s a little bit of sort of the secret sauce under the hood with sales right now is that the maturity is increasing quickly with a lot more reps having been here for 2 plus years and they really get the hang of how Dynatrace is different, who to find and how to articulate our value advantage. Got it. Great. Thanks. Thanks for that compare. Thanks, Walter. Maybe I can just add real quickly, I know people are going to have to hop a quick thank you for joining us. You could tell Q3 was a great quarter for us, sets us up for a great finish in 2021 we think. And we are pleased with how the market is moving, how our go-to-market is paying off innovation engine alive and well. And we are looking forward to giving you guys an update in May as to Q4 results and the year as well as FY ‘22 guidance. So with that, we are back to execution. Thank you very much and have a great day. Cheers. Thank you. That does conclude today’s teleconference and webinar. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.","a detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website . the forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company’s views on October 28, 2020 .",1.0

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Noelle Faris, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Great, operator. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining Dynatrace's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 earnings conference call.

A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP measures can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.
And with that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, John Van Siclen. John? Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to report that we had another quarter of strong execution, exceeding guidance across all our key operating metrics.
ARR was $774 million up 35% year-over-year. Subscription revenue was $183 million, an increase of 35% year-over-year. And unlevered free cash flow was $86 million for the quarter bringing full year unlevered free cash flow to $237 million dollars or 34% of revenue. These continued strong results were driven by the ongoing combination of solid new logo additions to the Dynatrace platform, the ongoing expansion of existing customers and an inherently efficient business model allowing us to deliver a sustained balance of growth and profitability.
Encouragingly, we're starting to see signs of stabilization in the vertical markets most heavily impacted by the pandemic. These previously challenged verticals are once again investing in their digital transformation journeys. Our ability to successfully navigate through this past year is a testament to the resilience of our value proposition, our commitment to customer success and our incredible team. I want to take a moment to thank them, our 2,800 employees worldwide for their focus diligence and teamwork throughout this past fiscal year. Their talent, attitude and customer-first mindset are key to what makes Dynatrace such unique and strong company. The strength of our Q4 and year-end results as a baseline and solid outlook and fundamentals to build on as we go forward, we will be setting guidance for fiscal 2022, which, Kevin will provide more detail on shortly.
This morning, I'd like to discuss four topics that I believe, provide a proper backdrop for continued success in fiscal '22 and beyond. First, a brief reflection on our past two years as a public company and the track record we built. Second, the powerful combination of new logos and consistent expansion across our customer base, our building blocks for sustained growth at scale. Third, our progress in go-to-market and commercial expansion initiatives underpinning these building blocks for growth and fourth, the acceleration of our continuous innovation for sustained competitive differentiation and value in this evolving market.
Let me start with a brief look back over these past two years as a public company. Two years ago, we said we transitioned our customer base smoothly and efficiently from what we call classic products to the new Dynatrace platform. Today, 99% of ARR is on the new platform. We said we transitioned to a predictable high growth subscription business. Today, 93% of our revenue is subscription with strong growth in the mid 30% range year-over-year. We said our platform was highly differentiated, a powerful combination of best-in-class observability infused with AIOps automation capabilities, ideally suited to dynamic modern cloud use cases. The addition of nearly 1200 new logos to the franchise over the past two years is proof that these capabilities and our unique value proposition are resonating with customers. And we said we would sustain a durable balance of growth and profitability and in fact we've done that.
A Rule of 60 for the last three years, including the last two as a public company when combining our ARR growth and unlevered free cash flow margin. It's been a solid start, we believe we delivered on our promises and built a predictable track record of success, a $774 million ARR business today with line of sight to a $1 billion business in the not too distant future. With the solid foundation in place, this leads me to the second topic, our building blocks for sustainable success. The powerful compounding effect of new logos and net expansion across our customer base. During fiscal 2021, we increased our Dynatrace customer base by over 20%, and ARR per customer high over 15%. The compounding effect of these two resulted in total ARR growth of 35% year-over-year. It's this consistent addition of new logos, while at the same time increasing our ARR per customer that we believe provides Dynatrace the opportunity to maintain 30% plus growth over the long term.
Specifically in Q4, we added 173 new logos to the franchise, up 19% year-over-year. New logo lands included Amica Insurance, Pan Airlines, Frontier communications and Harrods Limited. We continue to see cloud-first digital transformations accelerate globally and across all industries and governments, as software and applications become critical to how services are provided and revenue is driven.
As we've said underpinning digital transformation are dynamic multi-clouds. These environments can seem simple at first but when cloud native workloads hit the cloud platform, as dynamic container orchestration kicks in at scale and as DevOps teams accelerate the frequency of change, complexity and suits and at some point this complexity becomes overwhelming and intelligent automation becomes essential. It's this complexity wall, as some of our customers referred to it, that enables Dynatrace to enter any modern cloud environment and add significant value. Ease of scaling, faster innovation, lower risk and consistent success as cloud reach and impact increases at scale. On the expansion front, in Q4, we once again achieved a net expansion rate of over 120%, the 12th consecutive quarter we've achieved this result. Customers such as JPMorgan Chase, Pfizer, The European Commission, Cigna and DHL expanded their Dynatrace footprints to simplify and accelerate their digital transformations.
We continue to believe most of our customers are still in the 15% to 20% range of instrumented applications, with 3 to 4 times more applications targeted for full stack observability. This alone provides us plenty of opportunity to continue expanding in Tier 1 and 2 applications, our bread and butter. And add to this, the significant cross-sell opportunity across what are now five additional modules beyond full stack APM with the recent addition of cloud automation and cloud app security and you can see why we believe we can achieve an average ARR per customer of greater than $1 million over time. In fact customers who are using three plus modules today have an average ARR of nearly $500,000, almost two times our customer average of $260,000. This brings me to the third topic for this morning, commercial expansion, given the powerful market trends, our high-value differentiation and an expanding platform with multiple monetizable modules, commercial expansion continues to be a huge focus for us.
I'm very pleased to see our progress back to healthy sales and marketing spend levels again in the mid '30s as a percent of revenue. As we've discussed, we are investing in a combination of direct sales team expansion, cloud partner ecosystem expansion and marketing driven opportunity generation. I'm pleased to report that over the last 12 months, we were able to increase our quota carrying sales reps by 25% year-over-year and are targeting the step up quota carrier expansion to the 30% range here in fiscal Q1 and for the balance of the year. In addition, we continue to fuel our cloud partnerships, both cloud SIs and strategic tech partner alliances. Cloud SI influence is now up to over 40% of our transactions worldwide. These are regional and global cloud SIs responsible for ecosystem integration of cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure and GCP with container orchestration from IBM, OpenShift or VMware or Tanzu. Dynatrace's intelligent automation, wide and deep observability coverage and prebuilt extensions for easier implementation make it an ideal platform for these cloud SIs to leverage for any combination of modern cloud transformation.
Also in Q4, we continued our go-to-market progress with the three big hyperscalers, AWS, Microsoft and Google. During the quarter dozens of joint customers transacted with us through marketplace offers across these three hyperscalers as they look to leverage cloud spend and simplify their procurement processes. And as we continue building strong go-to-market relationships, we are also expanding our technical fit into new areas. For example, with AWS, we recently added AIOps competency credentials to our containers, DevOps and Cloud Migration competencies. We believe being the first and only observability platform to have added AIOps credentials will help us to continue to differentiate our offerings in the minds of the ever-expanding AWS community.
In addition, a marketing progress should not be overlooked. It's a fuel for brand awareness and opportunity generation and we've intensified our investment here over the past several quarters. Having 28,000 registered attendees for our February user conference Perform, 40% more than I projected at the end of January. It was a massive hit, expect to see ongoing investments in marketing to fuel sales and partner expansion as we go forward. This brings me to the fourth and final topic I wanted to cover today, the sustainability of our innovation engine.
As many of you have witnessed, this is a dynamic market everchanging, always evolving, littered with companies could not see around the corner and keep up. I'm proud to say Dynatrace has stood the test of time and not only succeeded when others have faltered. But has actually thrived on disruptive change. We believe Gartner's recent 2021 APM Magic Quadrant is a perfect example. APM is the high ground for any observability conversation. It's where the business meets IT, in this critical area, Dynatrace has been a leader 11 consecutive times, and once again this year, we lead in both completeness of vision and ability to execute.
Through multiple market shifts and changing competitive dynamics, Dynatrace has adapted, anticipated and thrived. There were several recent examples of this innovation engine in action. In February, we announced a new Cloud Automation Module to our platform. The Cloud Automation Module enables DevOps teams to continuously deliver high quality code and innovation faster, with more consistency and greater efficiency. This module brings intelligent, automatic closed-loop remediations to critical DevOps processes, an important step toward autonomous cloud operation.
Also, in February, we announced enhanced log analytics support with discovery and analysis of cloud platform logs from AWS, Azure, Google and Kubernetes, as well as open source logs such as Fluent and Logstash. Now, customers can extend visibility in cloud native environments and begin consolidating their log use cases and spend into Dynatrace, gaining both efficiency and lower costs. In this past quarter, we announced advanced GDPR functionality and session replay for mobile to our digital experience module. These capabilities provide important global and technical expansion to drive DEM adoption further and faster across more customer applications than ever before.
Leveraging a combination of our proven approach, a highly talented R&D team and the rapid growth in engineering talent that mirrors the pace of growth of the company itself, we are confident our innovation engine will continue to drive high value, highly differentiated capabilities across both platform and modules, well into the future.
With that, let me summarize; these past two years have been fantastic, capped off with a great Q4 and year-end to our fiscal 2021. We've invested in the building blocks for sustained high growth to drive the compounding combination of new logos and continuous ARR expansion across our growing base. We've proven our ability to execute through challenging times and in a rapidly evolving market and we've delivered on our promise of a balanced approach to growth and profitability, sustaining a Rule of 60 business for the past 3 years.
With that, let me turn it over to Kevin take us into our financial results and guidance. Kevin? Thank you, John and good morning to everyone. As John mentioned, we delivered another great quarter across the board, driven by strong ARR performance well above our guidance range. The Dynatrace team has done a tremendous job executing in a challenging year. As you know, we believe ARR is the key performance metrics of the overall strength and health of the business. ARR was up $201 million over last year, ending the fiscal year at $774 million. This represents 35% year-over-year growth or 32% in constant currency.
Excluding the perpetual license headwind which negatively impacted ARR by $19 million or 3 percentage points, our adjusted ARR growth rate was 38% on an as reported basis and 35% on a constant currency basis. As we have communicated, the building blocks for ARR growth continue to be the combination of new logos and our net expansion rate. We continue to see momentum and new logo additions exceeding our expectations from a few quarters ago and well above the 9% growth rate last quarter. We added 173 new logos in the fourth quarter, representing 19% growth over the 145 new logos we added in Q4 of last year.
We ended the year with more than 2,900 Dynatrace customers. Our net expansion rate was above 120% for the 12th consecutive quarter and our ARR per Dynatrace customer increased to $260,000, up 17% year-over-year. Our average ARR per customer with three or more modules continues to increase. This cohort represented 35% of our customers in the fourth quarter up from 27% last year. As a result, we now have over 1,000 customers with three or more modules, an increase of almost 400 customers over the last year and it is noteworthy that these customers have an average ARR of nearly $500,000 per customer. As John said, we believe that as more and more customers adopt new modules and expand coverage, the average ARR per enterprise customer could be north of $1 million. Moving on to revenue, total revenue for the fourth quarter was $197 million, $5 million above the high end of our guidance and representing an increase of 31% on a year-over-year basis or 27% in constant currency.
The strength in total revenue growth is being driven by 35% growth in subscription revenue or 32% in constant currency. Overall, revenue came in nicely above guidance due to the strength in new logos and a solid net expansion rate, both driven by better sales productivity. With respect to margins, total non-GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter was 85% in line with last quarter and up 2 percentage points from Q4 of last year. We saw an expansion in our gross margin driven by cost savings related to the pandemic, combined with the benefits of our efficient Dynatrace platform. Our non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter was $49 million, $3 million above the high end of our guidance due to the revenue upside and associated gross margin expansion. This led to a non-GAAP operating margin of 25%, up 1 percentage point from the fourth quarter of last year. Non-GAAP net income was $43 million or $0.15 per share. This is a penny above the high end of our guidance due to the favorable revenue upside.
Turning to a quick summary of the financial results for the full year, total revenue was $704 million, $5 million above our guidance range and up 29% year-over-year or 28% in constant currency. Total revenue growth is being driven by the underlying growth in subscription revenue, which was $655 million, $3 million above the high end of our guidance, representing an increase of 34% year-over-year and 33% in constant currency. Non-GAAP operating income for the year was $207 million, above the high end of our guidance resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 29% up from 24% in fiscal '20. As we've mentioned in the past, we believe in a balanced approach to operating the business, one that delivers strong and durable performance on both the top line and bottom line.
And as John mentioned earlier, our strategy to invest in strategic areas to support the long-term growth of the business is the right one. While we ended fiscal '21 with 500 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin leverage compared to fiscal '20, a large portion of the leverage was driven by COVID related savings that we worked prudently throughout the course of fiscal '21 to reinvest back into the business to further support growth.
Turning to the balance sheet, as of March 31, we had $325 million of cash, an increase of $112 million over last year. Our long-term debt was $392 million at the end of Q4. Our gross debt was down $120 million over last year and down $60 million sequentially due to a principal repayment that we made earlier in the fourth quarter. In addition, we made another repayment of $30 million during the month of April, further reducing our debt balance to about $362 million. We are extremely pleased with our ability to generate cash, while at the same time significantly increasing our investment levels in the business. As we have shared in the past, we committed to reducing our outstanding debt and improving our leverage ratio and I am pleased to report that we have delivered.
Our unlevered free cash flow for Q4 was solid at $86 million. For the full year, our unlevered free cash flow was $237 million or 34% of revenue. This margin level is above our previous unlevered free cash flow margin guidance of 32% of revenue due to the combination of strength of ARR, stronger collections and some other working capital improvements. The last financial measure that I would like to mention is our remaining performance obligation, which at the end of the quarter was approximately $1.2 billion, an increase of 38% over Q4 of last year. The current portion of RPO, which we expect to recognize as revenue over the next four quarters was $684 million, also an increase of 38% year-over-year. As I had mentioned in the past, we believe ARR is the best metric to remove billings and contracting noise, but we do provide RPO as we believe over time it will become a more meaningful metric.
Now, let me turn to guidance. Again, our key financial metric to understanding the business momentum is ARR and the building blocks to ARR growth are new logos and our net expansion rate. We believe the investments we are making in commercial expansion and product innovation will enable us to sustain 15% to 20% new logo growth and maintain 120% net expansion rate for fiscal '22. From the guidance standpoint ARR is expected to be between $975 million and $990 million, up 26% to 28% year-over-year or 25% to 27% in constant currency. Our ARR guidance assumes 3 to 4 percentage points of headwind to ARR growth in fiscal '22 due to the headwind associated with perpetual license wind down. We expect it will be at the higher end of that range for the first two quarters and then drop to 3% in Q4. At the end of the year. We believe perpetual license will be down to 1% to 1.5% of total ARR which will essentially end the perpetual license transition and associated ARR headwind.
Excluding the perpetual license headwind, our full year adjusted ARR growth rate is expected to be between 28% to 30% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Wrapping up our ARR discussion, as we have outlined in the past, our business is not linear from quarter to quarter with a fair amount of seasonal strength in the back half of the year with Q3 being our strongest quarter followed by Q4. We do expect quarterly ARR expansion seasonality to be consistent with what we saw last year. Total Revenue for the full year is expected to be $885 million to $900 million up 26% to 28% year-over-year or 24% to 26% in constant currency. Underlying that subscription revenue is expected to be between $834 million and $848 million, up 27% to 29% year-over-year or 25% to 27% in constant currency. As discussed, we expect subscription revenue to be 94% of total revenue driven by the size and strength of ARR and associated subscription revenue growth.
Moving down to P&L, we expect full year non-GAAP operating income to be between $203 million and $216 million. From an investment standpoint, we are focused on the long-term growth of the business. We believe the proper levels of spend for sales and marketing to be in a range of 34% to 36% of revenue and R&D to be around 15% of revenue. This result is a non-GAAP operating margin of 23% to 24% for the year. For the full year, we expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.59 to $0.62 per share based on 292 million to 293 million diluted shares outstanding.
Our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS calculations assuming non-GAAP effective cash tax rate of 12%. We believe utilizing an annual non-GAAP effective cash tax rate reduces quarterly variability. A recap of the first three quarters of our fiscal '21 quarterly results is available in the financial tables in today's press release and also reflects a non-GAAP effective cash tax rate of approximately 8%, which was used throughout fiscal '20. At these investment levels, we are able to deliver very solid unlevered free cash flow margins. For the year, we expect unlevered free cash flow margin to be approximately 29% to 30% of revenue, which is $256 million to $268 million.
Looking at Q1, we expect total revenue to be between $202 million and $204 million, up 30% to 31% year-over-year, 25% to 26% in constant currency. Subscription revenue is expected to be between $190.5 million and $192 million, up 32% to 33% year-over-year or 27% to 28% on a constant currency basis. From a profit standpoint, non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $49 million and $51 million, 24% to 25% of revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $0.14 to $0.15 per share.
In summary, we are very pleased with our fourth quarter and fiscal '21 performance where we saw strong ARR and top line growth combined with healthy margins. We remain excited about the growth opportunity with a line of sight to $1 billion in ARR. This is another important milestone and further enhanced by being one of the few software companies operating at a Rule of 50 plus.
To wrap up, we have a solid position in the growing market, strong product differentiation and the compelling value proposition that we believe will help us maintain topline growth well into the future. At the same time, we also have a consistent track record of making the right strategic investments to maintain healthy margins and cash flow. Overall, we believe we are well positioned for sustained and durable growth in fiscal '22 and beyond.
And with that, we'll open the line for questions. Operator? [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Bhavan Suri from William Blair. Your line is now live. Thank you everybody and congratulations. That was just a strong, strong finish there. I guess I wanted to touch a little on the sale investments and the partner investments and maybe this is for, John here but -- but as you think about, you're accelerating sales investments to 30% growth in headcount, you're increasing the partner investment. I'd like to -- how you're balancing a two because obviously one feels more profitable than the other one and the partners do the pushing of the sales process and you're brought in kind of at the end. And then, the second piece is how does the drive because that is going to be 30% growth in sales plus partners means that potentially ARR could grow well north of 30%, so love to hear how you think about that? Sure, Bhavan. And thank you for the comments there. So the combination of investments, they really do go hand in hand. We don't look at partners as necessarily a separate channel. We see it as augmentation to our go-to-market approach, whether they are the ones that source an opportunity or we do, we work hand in hand to make sure that we do sort of the right thing for our customer base. Remember, our customer base are the largest companies on the planet, $1 billion plus companies, so they pretty much always have someone in there helping them with their digital transformation. So, we see it sort of hand in glove and the combination actually driving greater momentum and productivity for our sales organization. And you're right in that, if we do our job right and we execute well that we have an accelerant ahead of us. It's yet to -- yet to pay off in that manner, but we're working hard at it and see some great opportunity ahead. Understood. And just I appreciate the color. I'm sorry, Bhavan, just to jump in right, in terms of the tailwinds to productivity as I think about in the next couple of years as you mentioned, there is the 30% quota capacity, there is the partner program which we're investing in which is great. We've also came off the conversion program and I think this is the first quarter where we saw some tangible results there and also something we've talked about historically as well as the maturing of the sales organization and we've seen a nice improvement over the last 12, 18, 24 months of reps that have been here for a longer period of time, which we believe can deliver higher productivity over time. So all those we believe are good tailwinds to the business and support long-term sustainable ARR growth. That's really helpful. I want to follow on that but next question for you guys about the ServiceNow relationship, you want to share the productivity improvements that we create. But I do want to close on ServiceNow. ServiceNow, you've had a great partnership and obviously you do a ton of work for Bill McDermott and other company when this previously -- where you were instrumental in supporting that, they entered the observability space. Just give your thoughts in terms of did that change in relationship. How you are thinking about that, what does that mean, because that was a great sort of somewhat unique partnership you have with ServiceNow. I know it's a good question and I'm sure timely question on people's minds. Our relationship with ServiceNow has really been in the field with joint customers and those joint customers need our platforms to work extremely well together and that's where our focus has been and that's why sort of pulled us -- pulled us together. The fact that they added a little bit of sort of observability sort of a future piece part tool, it will make sense for them, they need to be relevant inside cloud, they are outside looking in at the moment. So, it makes sense that they would try to get into a conversation there not in yet. But as far as our relationship, our platform is much larger and much more strategic to customers than sort of a piece part add on. So I don't really see any change to the relationship with service now in the field as we go forward. Thanks. Great, thank you, gents. And congrats, again, on solid results. Thank you. Thank you. Your next question today is coming from [indiscernible] from Barclays. Your line is now live. Thank you and congrats from me as well. And on a slightly is similar topic, John, you mentioned in the quarter and it's really nice to see how you guys kind of move on to the top right and that kind of distancing yourself from the other guys, but you also saw like some of the newer entrants Kind of coming up here, can you just, for our benefit, help us understand a little bit where they might be playing versus you are playing in that broader space to get a little bit of differentiation to me from our checks, it seems more without winning the enterprise and someone comes more on low-end but like just help me understand that a little bit better. Thank you. That's the right observation, we've been clear since sort of IPO and actually years before that we were going to focus ourselves on what are more challenging customers, bigger and more scalable problem set, which we excel at. So we focus on that global 15,000 and we consistently win in that world. There are other entrants that enter sort of in the departmental or SMB markets, some excelling in those -- in those markets, but that's really a quite a different -- different market space. In our world, the combination of observability with automation and AI assistance, you know, it's a critical intersection. There is no way to deal with the volume velocity and variety of data explosion, the dynamic orchestration of these multi-cloud environment, frequency of change, you know, of multiple DevOps teams. Without some level, in fact, sophisticated levels of automation and so that's really setting us apart giving us fuel. You can see it in our numbers, you can see it in the new logo growth, the expansion growth that combination resonates with these large enterprise class customers.
So we're happy with where we are, we appreciate Gartner's support for the unique value proposition that we bring to the market and we see a lot of great opportunity ahead with this combination and then continuing to fuel it. As I said in my prepared remarks, with the continuous innovation engine that we have that's just rolling the long like crazy right now. Okay, perfect. Thank you. And then, one follow-up and more for Kevin maybe, as we start the New Year like and your investments are increasing on the sales and marketing side, et cetera. Anything we should be aware of in terms of field structure as the year starts to kind of get more the logo driven or change in the sales force a little bit, anything on that side. Thank you. We've been doing some minor adjustments along the ways but at the end of the day, we're an enterprise sales organization with a named account strategy and that will be complemented by our partner program as well. So our goal is just making sure we're hired at all levels of the organizations, from the VPs to VRDs, account down to the account executives and scaling these things out globally. So no fundamental changes, it's more of the same, albeit at a better -- at a faster clip hopefully going into fiscal '22 here. Perfect, congrats. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Gray Powell from BTIG. Your line is now live. Great, thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the strong results. Thank you. Maybe starting off on just sort of the obvious side, I mean you all had a very good fiscal '21. I think you beat your initial ARR guidance by over 10%. At the same time you talked about how 15% to 20% of your business was from highly exposed industries. So, is it possible to quantify what you think was the headwind from COVID even if it's just a ballpark number of last year. And then, and then how should we think about the slope of recovery within those that impacted customer cohort. Thanks. Sure. Kevin, why don't I start and if you want to put any, you now, a little bit of quant on it because we have quanted it a little bit during the year. So from the challenged verticals where they were -- there were more challenge in the first half than the second half. And as I said in my remarks, we're starting to see a recovery of those verticals as they prepare for sort of re-emergence into growth verticals going forward. And with that, software is one of the first things everyone invests in to make sure that the most efficient, most agile, and more scalable, they can be. The last thing they want is a fumble on their, sort of, re-emergence from the pandemic. So that's what we're starting to see. It's encouraging and we look forward to having a full set of global verticals and governments investing in digital transformation in 2022 and beyond. Kevin, any point you want to add. Yes, just in terms of our results this year, obviously, as John mentioned in Q2 was the strongest -- was the quarter where we are most heavily impacted from a COVID headwind and that was about 3 to 4 points is the way we sort of frame that at the time and then going into Q3 that number got cut in half and going into Q4, it reduced as well. So there still is a little bit of a headwind, but as John says companies are starting to ramp back up and making those investments and we sort of think at this point, it's somewhat immaterial in terms of the headwind to the businesses, which is why we're not breaking it out as one of those tailwinds or headwinds to growth going forward. Understood. That makes a lot of sense. Okay, thank you very much. Thank you. The next question is coming from David Hynes from Canaccord. Your line is now live. Hey, thanks guys, congrats on the strong results. John, I wanted to ask, look, obviously the plans are in place to accelerate sales investment that's awesome. I'm going to be greedy, I'm going to ask why not more, right. I mean do you think the market could support faster sales investments and I'd be curious to get your thoughts on kind of the gating factors there, just about operationalizing a larger team, or is there more to it. No, it's a great question, we ask ourselves out of all the time as well, but I talked about this before. In order to operationalize sales expansion, it takes a superstructure. It takes onboarding, it takes operations for sort of measurement, productivity improvement, assurance that the bodies you're adding are actually turning into quota capacity and so we've stepped up from the 20% range to 25%, we're now 25% to 30%. We see line of sight to be able to do that with the investments we've made in the sales structure as well as the partnerships because that's pretty key as well. Same thing with marketing opportunity development. So we have the building blocks in place that we didn't have maybe a year ago, to be able to step up to 30% and once we hit 30 and we're doing well and scale on that, we'll be -- we'll be talking about 35%. So it's a prudent approach. I think to scaling the sales operation. Yes, makes sense. Maybe I can follow up with a different competitive question, Bhavan asked about ServiceNow. I want to ask you about Splunk. I know you've talked about having lots of joint customers in the past, I'm curious what you're hearing there as they expand into observability, I mean obviously lots of work for them to do in terms of getting the product together, but I'm curious how you see that playing out. I mean do you think they'll try and be price disruptive. I know they're not a core competitor today but would love any thoughts. Yes. So we really haven't seen a change in the -- in the market environment or any of the conversations with our customers over the last really two years since they've been acquiring companies and I think their recent announcements of their observability cloud is just sort of a repackaging of what they've already been talking about. So, not sure what's -- what's going on over there, and sort of how they're putting things together, but I will say that the customers that we talk to and as you point out, many are sort of have Splunk platforms in as well. They really value the automation and AI assistance that we bring because they know they have a real-time massively scalable cloud challenge in front of them and a suite of tools is not going to cut it. So I like our differentiation whenever Splunk gets sort of their focus together, who knows, but like I said, I think the market is moving more toward us and away from just a simple observability play certainly at the enterprise level. Yes, very helpful. Thanks guys and congrats, again. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Matt Hedberg from RBC. Your line is now live. Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. Hey John, hearing you talk about maintaining 30% growth over the long time is certainly impressive and I guess part of that thesis I think is continuing to kind of diversify away from APM and last quarter I think you noted 40% of your customers or may be nearly 40% were using infrastructure on non-full-stack workloads. I'm wondering, can you comment on how that might trend this year and then I guess sort of importantly why have you been so successful cross-selling outside of APM? Well, so there are several things going on at that at the same time that are actually helping us giving us a bit of a tailwind. One of them is that the conversations that we're having with customers are less about APM, less about a layer and more about the whole full stack observability approach which is perfect for us because that's what we rebuilt and reinvented our platform around, a full-stack approach, logs, metrics, user experience, topology et cetera. So it's a perfect for us. Perfect conversation and I think that's accelerating the multi-module approach, and we'll continue to do that this year. I mean the fact that we have 35% of our customers now with 3 plus modules is something that I see as continuing to penetrate that customer base whether we take it to 45% or 50%, not sure this year, but it's certainly a key part of our focus.
I think the other part of this is that once we relieved the sales organization of conversions, we were able to really step them up and focus them on cross selling, and I think you see that in the numbers this year. I mean, obviously we're maintaining great and healthy net expansion rate and I see that continuing as well. And with the innovation engine adding a few more modules to that portfolio, that's all goodness as well for that multi-module cross selling. So I think you're going to see more of the same, the sales organization is doing a great job absorbing the additional functionality and customers are looking forward to it. I mean the centering of our platform around AIOps capabilities really unifies all these modules into a very powerful combination.
So, yes, we look -- we look forward to '22 and beyond and we really do feel like we're in a good place and we're riding a lot of great market momentum at this moment; so we'll keep it out. That's great. Certainly seems evident to us as well. And I guess, Kevin, you always do a good job of outlining sort of some of your building blocks assumptions for ARR and there's been a lot of focus on NRR and obviously on your kind of your quarter capacity adds this year, but I think you added about 20%. You grew your customer base by about 20% last year, I guess -- I'm wondering sort of within your ARR guide, what is sort of your assumption on customer adds this year, do you think you might grow that -- grow that base even more than you did last year. So, I'd break it into two components. One is when we just look at the new logo additions, last year we added about 584 to new logos to the business and what we've talked about in the call is adding another 15% to 20% and frankly we're hopeful internally that we can overachieve that. So that would be the on the positive side to adding to 2,900 customer base. From a churn standpoint, we still have a couple of hundred customers who are single module, very small customers that came over the last couple of years from some of the -- primarily from some of the conversion programs that we did and if you add up those customers, I think it's the total number is around 300 customers, of the 2900 customers, it represents less than $10 million of ARR, I think it's in that $7 million to $8 million range of ARR.
So, I think you will see some of that churn. We will certainly try to make sure that those -- some of those customers become platform customers, but if they don't, Matt, we're going to churn those out and frankly just sort of refocus our energies on more what we believe would be more strategic opportunities. So long way of saying, take the 2,900, you add the new logos that are going to come in over the next 12 months and then there will be some churn component related to that single module non-strategic customer base that has a very low ARR [ph]. Hopefully that helps. Yes, no, that's super helpful. Congrats from me as well on the results, that's very strong. All right. Thank you, Matt. Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Andrew Nowinski from D.A. Davidson. Your line is now live. Great, thank you. So a couple of questions. I think you mentioned that the ARR per customer increased $260,000 in Q4. Can you just talk about maybe more specifically which modules might be driving that increase and then I have a follow-up. Thanks. Sure. Well, we don't break it out every quarter all the different pieces, but obviously we land in a full stack APM mode in the modern clouds because you need that application, infrastructure, network, logs, metrics, trace, topology, kind of combination in order to really understand how the apps are working in dynamic multi-clouds. So that's still the landing zone. But from an expansion standpoint, it's still a combination of the infrastructure only like extending the Dynatrace platform beyond the full-stack host unit environments to try to get that additional visibility and AI assistance across a wider footprint. So that's continuing to expand within our customer base and the digital experience elements as well where customers, the pandemic really forced a lot of our customers to understand their remote customer pace better because they couldn't interact with them in any other way.
So our digital experience business, especially the mobile application monitoring took a big tick up over last year and we don't see that slowing down at all. So those are probably the two primary and then we are seeing more and more metric ingestion areas whether they're business metrics with our business analytics or whether they're additional data elements into our AI engine, which are starting to fuel some of the ingestion metrics as well. So it's actually a combination. I mean, everything's working pretty well but I think the infrastructure extension and the digital experience are the two primary drivers of additional modules. Super. Thanks, John. And then, I know the cloud application security module is very new, but I was wondering if you could just comment on how customer adoption was of that solution last quarter and do you think that has enough features in it to see a fairly significant increase in adoption this year or this coming fiscal year here or is there more work to be done before it starts to contribute. Sure. So first of all, we're super excited the feedback we're getting right now is, it supports our thesis. We're entering the right place, it's a greenfield space and there is a little more work to do in order to fill out the product for it to be enterprise ready. You got to remember that our customer base are billion dollar plus companies. They are very, very picky and they expect a pretty wide footprint of coverage before they're willing to add something else to their security portfolio. But that said, we've touched about 10% of our customer base, everyone pretty much to the company is thrilled that we're getting into the space, that this is a great entry point. The DevOps teams are particularly excited as they sort of pick up the DevSecOps approach, so it's early as we said, we knew we had a an early product, there was going to need to fill out in the first half of this year, but I think it's going to start to make an impact in the second half and definitely be ARR driver for us in fiscal '23 just as we had hoped. Great. Keep up the good work. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Sterling Auty from JP Morgan. Your line is now live. Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. So you talked about a little bit of stability in the hardest hit industries. But I want to go the other way, which industries are contributing the most at this point and how do you see that evolving through the rest of this fiscal year. I'd have to go down, sort of, you sort of a list here and there, and sort of compare, Sterling, what which ones have actually ticked up as a percent and I don't think we notice a big tick-up or tick-down from some of the stronger verticals, but there is one that sort of sticks out for us which I will mention and that is the governments. And these are governments around the world as well as the state governments in the U.S. The pandemic really change the dynamic for government interaction with citizens. And it's put a lot of pressure on sort of older system approaches that need to modernize quickly to modern cloud. And we've seen an uptick across state and national governments around the world in upgrading and digitally transforming faster their environments and so we've been investing some of our sales resources and expansion has been going into that space around the world and we see that is a new augmentation, if you will. I mean it's hard to call it a vertical, but it is something relatively new for us that gives us great promise in continued expansion in the government business. It's great. And then one follow-up, Kevin for you. Can you at least qualitatively give us a bridge of how we go from the operating margin in fiscal '21 to that in '22. So in other words, how much of this is coming from return to business travel, some of the pickup in T&A, how much is coming from sales and marketing expansion as you talked about versus other just so we can kind of understand the puts and takes? Yes. So as I'm sure you can see, over the course of fiscal '21 earlier in the year, we had quite a quite a big cost savings on the P&L that flowed through to Op income and we are prudent about how we put additional money to work over the course of Q3 and Q4 and I think you -- you see the results of that coming through the P&L and those investments were in more R&D resources, right, getting that spend back up to 15%-ish and then getting that sales and marketing the 34%, 36% and those investments in sales and marketing, at this point are primarily the people and around the partner programs, and some of the marketing programs that John talked about as well going forward. So when we think about fiscal '22, you know there's going to be more of the same of that right making sure, we'll keep R&D at 15% primarily through -- making sure we're tracking and hiring the right people, which we've been doing a great above.
Sales and marketing is going to be -- it's going to be quota, it's going to be direct sales organization, direct sales people more investments in the partner program and we do expect travel to come back online, more so in the Q3, Q4 timeframe, but given the strength of the P&L on the ARR and the topline growth we can absorb that without sacrificing frankly the investments that we're making in quota capacity right and driving higher quota capacity over time. So, we do expect a rebound a little bit in terms of COVID, some of the stuff we say from COVID but it's -- we still also don't think it's going to get back to normal. So it's -- we're pleased that those investments we're making this year are really about the people right, engineers and people in the sales organization and marketing organization to drive durable growth. Understood. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jack Andrews from Needham & Company. Your line is now live. Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could just describe how your view of the -- what the opportunity is for your Cloud Automation Module and whether you think this is largely a greenfield or displacement opportunity and how should we be thinking about the potential uplift or contribution of this module relative to some of the others in your portfolio. Yes, great question. No, we actually see it, you know as a greenfield opportunity and a continuation of an effort that we've had in place for a couple of years. It's actually maybe more of a formalization into a product module of an effort we've had, that's been mainly a services approach to date, but we've been productizing the modules and productization of some of that early services work -- its targeted first at the DevOps, continuous deployment or environments and bringing auto remediation and automated quality steps along the way to ensure greater code quality, consistency and efficiency as I said. So it's a -- we've always been involved in the DevOps processes because of our code level detail that we provide. But this actually adds significant intelligent automation to the process. That said, this is the beginning of the autonomous cloud approach. And so, what we then do is we take the same approach that we're taking right now in the DevOps and extended into cloud operations, the production operation environment again driving automatic remediations for the elimination of run books.
And so anyway, it's a journey for us, it's the first step we see the opportunity to say if you want to quant it think of it as $0.20 on the APM dollar kind of addition, and as we go this module become more and more valuable similar to what we're doing with the security module as we add capabilities and additional use cases, you know, will become more valuable as I said within the portfolio and for our customers. So, it's fairly early in its evolution. But again some great residents with customers who have been along the Services journey with us and have been looking for this level of productization so they can really scale it out within their organizations. That's really helpful commentary, thanks. And congratulations on the results. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is coming from [indiscernible] from JMP Securities. Your line is now live. Yes, thanks for taking the question and congrats on a very solid quarter. Most of the questions have been asked, but I'm just curious on the infrastructure module. Can you speak to the competitive dynamics with Datadog can you talk a little bit about whether you've seen any change in terms of efforts that they're making to compete and I presume that they are the incumbent in many of the accounts that you're talking to -- talk a little bit about how the displacements have gone with some of those accounts. Well, I don't have a lot -- we haven't seen a lot of change in our sort of competitive dynamic with Datadog. It's a massive market and so our overlap is still quite light. But what we are seeing is that -- with our infrastructure module we're competing more with a do-it-yourself approach. And what I mean by that is companies with many different products, different tools trying to measure telemetry from all different angles and just running into a massive challenge, it's sort of a tool fatigue, if you will where every man and woman for themselves and no consistent sort of source of truth across a wide footprint, which everyone is looking for in these modern clouds, and so when we extend, we consolidate tooling and provide a single source of automated truth for multiple different teams throughout the digital transformation and process. So, that's why we don't really think about competing against the Datadog. I mean they may be there, Relic may be there, you know, others -- open source tools may be there, but we saw a different problem, a bigger problem that is much more urgent for the larger customers where they really, really need fewer platforms, maybe they're not going to go to one, but fewer platforms to deal with this run away complexity that they're experiencing in their dynamic multi-clouds today.
So that's really the dynamic and that's what drives and fuels our expansion and that's really the dynamic we see in the market and we're well positioned for it. Thank you. We've reached end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further closing comments. Yes. Let me just -- let me just say thank you, again, for everybody who joined us this morning. We're coming off a fantastic fiscal '21, great momentum into '22, market is continuing to -- market trends are continuing to be in our favor. Our investments are paying off as I think you've seen in the results and hopefully going forward in the results and I look forward to reporting in July and updating everybody on our first step in fiscal '22. Thank you very much. Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.","the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 earnings conference call and Webcast is being recorded . this conference is now my pleasure to turn the call over to our chief executive officer, John Van Siclen . the forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's views on May 12, 2021 .",0.0

A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP measures can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.
And with that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, John Van Siclen. John? Thanks, Noelle. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to report that we had another strong quarter, once again beating guidance across all our key operating metrics led by ARR which was $823 million, up 37% year-over-year. Along with strong top line growth, we again delivered healthy profitability in terms of non-GAAP operating income, and EPS which Kevin will elaborate on in a few minutes.
And we continue to believe that a smart balance between growth and profitability makes for a more durable business. over the long term. Underpinning our consistent year-over-year top line growth above 30% are two key building blocks. Net new logos to the Dynatrace platform and the ongoing expansion of existing customers. I'm pleased to report that we added 135 new digitally transforming customers to the Dynatrace platform in Q1 up over 50% from a year ago. And that our net expansion rate fueled by growth across all modules was once again at or over 120%.
As we've said, we believe continued execution against these two building blocks will sustain a 30 plus percent growth business at scale for some years to come. With the strength of our Q1 results and positive outlook ahead we are increasing our guidance for fiscal 2022, which Kevin will provide more details on shortly.
This morning, I'd like to discuss three topics that I believe will continue to drive our momentum and success. First, the ongoing market dynamics that continue to drive new logo growth and rapid expansion within our growing base. Second, the progress we're making in commercial expansion to accelerate go-to market success. And third, the progress we're making an expanding our platform and module strength to address the full $50 billion TAM we see ahead of us.
Let me start with the market dynamics that provide us a unique long term growth opportunity. Even with a protracted pandemic, our value proposition remains resilient. We continue to see digital transformation accelerate in all geographies and all verticals. The pandemic has put everyone on notice how quickly change can happen and how important agility and risk mitigation strategies are to assuring a sustainable business.
At the core of digital transformation are three mega trends that are interrelated. The first, that applications leading the world as all businesses look for innovative ways to transform. The second is that these applications and the platforms they run on our cloud first, in fact, multi cloud first. And the third is the rise of automation and AI to ease the complexity, increase the speed and mitigate the risk of these transformations.
Dynatrace's unique combination of multi-cloud observability unified with powerful AI OPs capabilities is a pure play across all three of these mega trends. And we're still in the early innings of digital transformation in these three mega trends. Digital transformation is not an event. It's a journey. Take our automotive customers who are reimagining the driving experience, including driverless cars. Our healthcare customers, embracing digital devices for new ways to deliver healthcare, or our energy customers looking to replace carbon fuel with renewable energy for a better tomorrow. These are not short term efforts. They are long term transform the business strategies and they all depend on new cloud native applications running on multi-cloud platforms, leveraging automation and AI wherever possible for consistency, scale, and lower risk.
One of the other market characteristics that defines digital transformation is a digital transformers are the companies that our global economy depends on. They're the multibillion dollar banks, logistics companies, healthcare companies, energy companies, and government agencies. These organizations almost always have generations of technology to manage and migrate off of, and limited resources and expertise to deal with. Their application portfolios are rich, the transformation challenge is complex, and the urgency to innovate is high.
We continue to believe that we have the best platform and expertise fit for these large scale digital transformers. Proof of our superior fit with these digitally transforming customers can be seen in our numbers. As I mentioned earlier, we added 135 new logos to our franchise in Q1. Great companies such as Dell, Rock Central, Blue Cross Blue Shield and L'Oreal, all digitally transforming in one way or another; all with observability requirements that include hyper scalar platforms, Kubernetes container orchestration, cloud native applications, and modern DevOps practices.
Some of these companies are transitioning off outdated monitoring tools, while others have been trying to cobble together their own modern cloud observability solutions, and all considered multiple alternatives before selecting Dynatrace as their digital transformation partner.
On the expansion front, global leaders such as Traveler's insurance, Lloyds Banking Group, Toyota, Lowe's, and DHL expanded their use of Dynatrace this past quarter, and all now use three plus modules of Dynatrace to cover their multi-cloud observability needs.
As I've said before, once a customer experiences the ease of scaling, the power of our automation, transformative opportunity provided by our AI capabilities, they quickly look for opportunities to extend Dynatrace further across more application workloads, and across broader metric and log use cases.
So when we say the market is moving toward us, we mean just that the macro trends of applications eating the world, digital transformations as multi-cloud first, and the need for automation and AI capabilities on the rise, but it's in a very strong position for continued new logo and net expansion success going forward. This brings me to my second topic this morning, taking advantage of this fantastic market opportunity we have in front of us, and that's through increased investment in commercial expansion. You'll notice our sales and marketing spend has returned to our target range of 34% to 36% of revenue, a combination of three key efforts; sales force expansion, partner momentum, and doubling down on market awareness.
Our sales engine continues to scale. We grew our quota carriers by nearly 30% this past quarter, and expect to continue growing this team in the 30% range throughout fiscal 22. Productivity continues to be healthy, and the talent we are bringing on board has never been stronger. Dynatrace is considered a top company to work for around the globe and our customer first culture resonates with sales and go-to market talent. Helping to lift productivity are the cloud system integrators and strategic tech partners.
Our partner community is now influencing over 45% of our transactions globally. And the leverage we are seeing through the hyper scalar in marketplaces is growing even more rapidly. In fact, the number of deals closed with hyper scalar partners this quarter increased by more than four times compared to the same period last year. Our reputation for reducing risk and accelerating project success, especially for projects at scale is catching the eye of more and more partners and their community members. As we've said, our partner program is an important area of focus for us as we scale beyond a billion dollars.
Third pillar our commercial expansion is increasing the brand awareness of Dynatrace. A recent study showed that within our target account base, and global 15,000 we are now known for much more than APM. Our efforts to expand awareness to observability, infrastructure, logs and AI ops is paying off. We have more to do here for sure. But the awareness trends are scaling in the right direction. To help accelerate these trends we recently completed a series of 12 one day Dynatrace sessions around the world.
We call these Dynatrace go-events, where customers and prospects hear from peers how they're leveraging Dynatrace to digitally transform faster, smarter, easier, and lower risk and lower cost. We had over 20,000 registrants across these 12 events, and most exciting to me was a balance between customers and new logo prospects. 70% of the 20,000 were new logo prospects. Like I said, there is more work to be done to be better known for the value advantage we provide to digital transformers, but we are gaining on it every day.
The third and final topic I'd like to cover today is the maturing of the depth and breadth of our platform, and its growing number of monetizable modules. Our three plus module customer count continues to climb.
Today, over 40% of our 3000 plus customers leverage Dynatrace across three plus module use cases. And over 45% of our customers now use us beyond full stack applications infrastructure and log only use cases. Our infrastructure module, which includes modern cloud metrics, open ingest and log analytics is our fastest growing module with ARR growing more than 90% year-over-year. It's now fully featured and robust and capable of winning against any info log alternative and a big reason why we continue to win modern cloud observability business at a steady rate.
With over 1000 engineers now, we continue to advance all modules aggressively embracing new technologies, extending capabilities and enhancing used cases. So there's much to talk about here let me focus on just one of our new modules, our Cloud App Security module.
As we've said, we are still in the early phases of market adoption and product maturity. But the feedback so far is exciting. One of our banking customers who recently trialed the [indiscernible] module, told us that people and process limitations have prevented them from scanning more than once a week, even though they're deploying updates two to three times a week. This lesson with potential vulnerabilities.
With Dynatrace, they realize they could have real time coverage 24 by seven, and that's huge. Another customer, a government agency recently migrating to Azure said that as they started rolling out cloud native applications, their existing security tooling quickly became cumbersome, slowing them down, and with output no longer actionable. Amazingly, in just the trial, Dynatrace was able to immediately detect nearly 100 vulnerabilities that needed fixing. They now deploy this mission critical app securely. Thanks to Dynatrace.
It's clear from these and many other examples that are value proposition and timing could not be better. The dev sec ops movement is gaining momentum there is no good answer for continuous vulnerability detection with intelligent scoring to reduce risks while accelerating ongoing innovation. We continue to see a powerful greenfield opportunity for this new module and are excited with its potential to rapidly scale within our base during the second half of this fiscal year.
The need is there, and the deployment is frictionless.
With that, let me summarize as I've covered several important topics this morning. We have an incredible long term market opportunity and we are investing aggressively to seize the advantage. Commercial expansion is increasing and continuous innovation is being delivered across all modules. Our platform continues to mature and we continue to scale well beyond our TAM routes. We are gaining new digital transformer logos at a steadily increasing rate. And the net expansion of our base across multiple modules continues to be robust and it's a compounding of these two; new logos to the franchise and maintaining a healthy net expansion rate above 120% that we believe provide us the building blocks to sustain a 30% plus growth business well into the future.
Let me now turn it over to Kevin to take us into our financial results and guidance. Kevin? Thank you, John. And good morning everyone. As John mentioned, we delivered another great quarter setting this up for a strong fiscal 22. The investments we have made and commercial expansions that drive sales productivity are evident across all of our top line metrics with ARR revenue and subscription revenue exceeding our guidance. We believe annual return revenue is a key performance metric of the overall strength of the business. ARR for the first quarter was $823 million.
That's up $222 million year-over-year, 37% growth as reported and 32% in constant currency. Excluding the perpetual license wind down which was roughly $25 million, or 4 percentage points, our adjusted ARR growth was 41% as reported, and 36% on a constant currency basis, all up sequentially from Q4. The building blocks for sustain ARR growth rate remained the same. The new enterprise logo additions to the Dynatrace platform, combined with how well we expand existing customer relations as measured by our Dynatrace net expansion rate.
As John said, new global growth in the first quarter was very strong, with 135 new logos added in the quarter and we have been landing our new logos over the past year at a very consistent land ARR of a little over $100,000 per new logo. This new logo growth represents a 52% increase over the 89 new logos we added in Q1 of last year which is a soft compared to the COVID environment. We ended Q1 with over 3,000 Dynatrace customers.
Consistent with historical trends once customers see the value of the Dynatrace platform, they're eager to adopt new modules and expand coverage. This is evident in our net expansion rate, which for the 13th consecutive quarter was at or above 120%. As a result of this, our ARR per Dynatrace customer continues to increase and in Q1 it was $271,000 per customer an increase of 19% over last year. Adding on to that we continue to see notable strength in both the number of customers with three or more modules, and the expansion of the average ARR per customer in this cohort. At the end of Q1 more than 40% of our customers are using three or more modules with an average ARR of nearly $500,000 per customer. We now have over 1200 customers using three modules and this cohort increased by well over 400 customers over the last year.
Moving on to revenue. Total revenue for the first quarter was $210 million, $6 million above the high end of our guidance and representing an increase of 35% year-over-year, or 29% in constant currency. Subscription revenue for the first quarter was $197 million, an increase of 36% year-over-year, or 30% in constant currency. We are very pleased with the strength of our ARR and associated revenue performance as it further validates our strategy to accelerate investments in sales and marketing.
With respect to margins total non-GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was 85% in line with last quarter and Q1 of last year, a very healthy margin reflecting the power of the Dynatrace platform. From an investment standpoint, we continue to make solid progress investing for growth. Our R&D organization is now 1000 employees, and we invested $30 million in R&D this quarter. That's up 44% from last year, and approaching our targeted investment level of 15% of revenue.
On the commercial side, we continue to scale our sales organization which as noted earlier is tracking 30% sales rep growth. Likewise, our partner organization has grown by over 30% in the last year and we continue to invest marketing dollars focus on brand and pipeline development. Our sales and marketing investments are up 66% over last year and within our targeted investment zone of 34% to 36% of revenue.
With these levels of increased investments, we continue to run a balanced business. Our non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $54 million, $3 million above high end of our guidance range due to the revenue upside. This led to a non-GAAP operating margin of 26% compared to 33% in the first quarter of last year. Again, keep in mind we saw significant savings in the first half of last year related to COVID shut down and our Q1 margin profile was more in line with how we exited fiscal 20. On the bottom line, non-GAAP net income was $45 million or $0.16 per share. This is a penny above the high end of our guidance range primarily due to the favorable revenue upside.
Turning the balance sheet. As of June 30, we had $387 million of cash, an increase of $137 million compared to the same period last year. We're pleased with our continued healthy cash generation and believe it puts us in a strong position to consider strategic business investments where there is an opportunity to accelerate our growth in selected areas. Our unlevered free cash flow for Q1 was $81 million or 39% of revenue. Remember due to season of their variability, we believe it's best to view unlevered free cash flow on a full year basis. We're extremely pleased with a strong start to the year and this achievement puts us in a good position to deliver on our previous guidance of 29% to 30% of revenue for fiscal 22.
The last financial measure that I would like to discuss is our remaining performance obligations, which at the end of the quarter was about $1.3 billion, an increase of 46% over Q1 of last year. The current portion of RPO, which we expect to recognize as revenue over the next four quarters was $710 million, an increase of 41%, year-over-year. Though RPO may become a more meaningful metric for us in the future, we continue to believe ARR is the best metric to understand the performance of the business because it removes variability associated with billings and contracting changes.
Now, let me turn to guidance. As I outlined last quarter, we believe the investments we are making and commercial expansion and product innovation will enable us to maintain 120% net expansion and at least 15% to 20% new logo growth over the midterm. These are the core building blocks that lead to sustainable ARR growth rate over 30%. With respect to fiscal 22, we expect ARR to be between $984 million and $996 million, up 27% to 29% year-over-year, or 26% to 28% in constant currency. This is an increase of 1 percentage point across these growth rates when compared to our previous guidance. Keep in mind our ARR guidance assumes 3 to 4 percentage points of headwind to ARR growth rates in fiscal 22 due to the perpetual license wind down.
We expect headwind in the second and third quarters to be a little over 4 points, and then it will decline to about 3 points in Q4 and drop thereafter. Excluding the perpetual license headwind, our full year adjusted ARR growth rate is expected to be between 29% to 31% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Wrapping up our ARR discussion and seasonality. As we have outlined in the past, our business continues to add strength in the back half of the year, with Q3 being our strongest quarter, followed by Q4.
Moving on to revenue, total revenue for the full year is expected to be $902 million to $914 million, up 28% to 30% year-over-year, and 26% to 28% in constant currency. Underlying that subscription revenue is expected to be between $848 million and $856 million, up 29% to 31% year-over-year, or 27% to 29% in constant currency. That's an increase of 2 percentage points for total revenue, and subscription revenue growth rates when compared to our previous guidance. And we continue to expect subscription revenue to be 94% of total revenue driven by the size and strength of ARR and associated subscription revenue growth.
Moving down the P&L, we expect full year non-GAAP operating income to be between $208 million and $218 million. As we continue the message, we are investing for the long term sustainable growth of the business. We believe the proper levels of investments for sales and marketing to be in a range of 34% to 36% of revenue and R&D to be around 15% of revenue.
The result of this is a non-GAAP operating margin of 23% to 24% of revenue for the year consistent with prior guidance and not from dollar standpoint to the higher revenue guidance. For the full year, we expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.60 to $0.63 per share, which is up a penny from our previous guidance. Our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS calculations assume a non-GAAP effective cash tax rate of 12% consistent with prior guidance. At these investment levels were able to continue delivering strong unlevered free cash flow margins for the year. as I just mentioned, we expect unlevered free cash flow to be $262 million to $274 million, or 29% to 30% of revenue.
To summarize our full year guidance, it is a continuation of our durable balance of growth and profitability guiding to a rule of 50 plus business when combined ARR growth and unlevered free cash flow margins. Looking at Q2 we expect total revenue to be between $219 million and $221 million up 30% to 31% year-over-year or 28% to 29% in constant currency. Subscription revenue is expected to be between $206.5 million and $208 million, up 31% to 32% year-over-year or 29% to 30% in constant currency. From the profit standpoint, non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $53 million and $55 million representing 24% to 25% of revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $0.15 to $0.16 per share.
In summary, we are very pleased with the overall momentum of our first quarter performance with a strong ARR and top line growth combined with healthy margins. We remain very excited about the high growth opportunities ahead of us. As John mentioned the ongoing market dynamics continue to drive the market towards us. We are investing in commercial expansion to accelerate go-to-market success and we continue to expand a platform and module strength to address the full $50 billion TAM we see ahead of us.
Overall we believe we are well-positioned for sustained and durable growth rate in fiscal ‘22 and beyond.
And with that we will open the line for questions. Operator? Thank you. And we will now be conducting question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Hi, thank you very much and congratulations on the quarter. John, I’m curious to get your thoughts on high level as you kind of scale the business to its true potential where it should be multiple to [indiscernible], how do you think about the broader commercialization of the Dynatrace whereby today you guided business model that relatively high age fees relative to where the industry is operating at what point do we start to see pending out of you will of deal, landing points you are able to target a multiple of the 3000 customers that you have said [indiscernible] very successful at scale have a customer base of tens of thousands.
As you think about the company strategy longer term how do you spin out the landing points and have a commercial sales channel that is able to target a much wider user base, I know that you do extremely well and you have very high concentration of the modules across the 3000 customers, how do you make this even more mainstream? Thank you so much. Hey Kash, appreciate it. So first there is nothing that precludes our platform from being able to scale down market. We’ve just decided as a business to stay focused. So we extend these first few years on what we see as the most sort of lucrative side of the business which is the global 15000. In fact about 70% of all IT spend is done by that global 15,000. So it's a massive market in and of itself against this huge TAM that we are looking at. So there is plenty of room to continue scaling out in every customer and across whatever growing sort of set of modules that we, the six we have today and more we envision for tomorrow. So we like where we are. We like the focus. It's paying off. We are really good at supporting these high end, high scale digital transformers. And you can see it in our numbers. We're just good at it. But like I said when the time comes to go to the global 25,000 or further, there's nothing that precludes us from being able to expand down market. Wonderful, thank you so much and congrats. Thank you. Your next question today is coming from Sterling Auty from JP Morgan. Your line is now live. Yes. Thanks. Hi, guys. So I wanted to ask about the hiring and the ramp of the new sales reps. With 30% increase are you seeing very consistent growth and productivity out of the new reps that you're adding quarter-over-quarter, especially now that you're getting to bigger and bigger numbers what changes have you had to make to be able to make that possible? Great, great questions Sterling. A lot of growing a sales organization like we're doing comes from anticipating the scale, because you need a superstructure of management, as well as an expansion of your onboarding program, sort of fan it out into the field can all be done via headquarters. So we have a combination of things going on. But I think the sales management would say that the biggest change over the last 12 months for us is the quality of the talent that we're attracting as a high growth, very successful company one that's focused on customers and one that's focused on sales success.
So a little bit of its culture drawing in some great talent and we're doing a better job of developing that talent quickly, I think and it's shown in the numbers. The last dimension is just the coverage just scale of sales organization each of the sales reps end up with sort of a portfolio of customers, they can actually get to as opposed to a list, but they can't get to them all. And so it's been, it's also helped us significantly with broader coverage. We go deeper with existing customers. We reach new customers faster. And it's it's all good. It's all paying off. Fantastic. Thank you. Thank you. Next question is coming from Bhavan Suri from William Blair. Your line is now live. Great, thanks. Can you hear me okay. We have you Bhavan. Great, great, congrats. That was a great RPO and billing numbers all around. I want to touch a little bit initially, John, on the competitive environment here. Over the last 18 months, we've seen sort of new products being introduced both by you, but by competitors, pricing model changes, and some of them deals in some of those competitors. Just some sense of what you see in competitive front, any change, and then any change in more, in terms of the trend around win rate. Morning Bhavan. In some ways, there's been very little change. In other ways there has been some larger changes. The little change is really around sort of this competitive dynamic everybody seems to worry about in this space. Really from our perspective, it hasn't gotten any more crowded nor was it really that crowded to begin with. Certainly at the enterprise level the digital transformer level that we focus on it's been, it's pretty simple. There is less than a handful of players that can play there. And most of them fall away the minute you get to scale multi cloud kind of scale.
On the other side what is happening is there is a marked shift toward observability, which is much more of a platform sort of concept where customers are tired of sort of the fragmentation of all the piece part tooling, and they really want to see more of a platform consolidation of their tracing, their metrics, their logs, etc. And we anticipated that, as you know, seven years ago, when we rebuilt our platform and refocused it. So we've been leading, and we've been trying to progress the concept of observability in the market, because we think it gives us strength in our landing zone. It's a new and expanded landing zone. And it also sets us up for quicker expansion which we're also seeing. So that's probably the other dimension of this where there is some change, and it's changed for the good for us. Yes, no, that's helpful. And I think you're right about the shift towards observability, especially with your partnership with telemetry, too. I guess one other one for me really quickly, is when you look at the metallogenic, right, it's remained relatively consistent, and really, really solid. But as you look at sort of when you're expanding into a company, I'd love to get a little color around the split between selling into adjacent kind of used cases or departments. So maybe going to e-commerce or usability or something like that, versus selling more modules into an existing kind of used case. So I've got sort of like the guys doing the data center and now they want everything measure. So help me think through how that deepening versus broadening plays out to drive NBRR, Yes. That's a big sort of varies by customer in a lot of ways. The very large customers have more sort of fragmentation between teams of who does what, and so to move from the application layer to the cloud platform where more of the infrastructure play as that's just moving to a different group that's adjacent to the first landing zone, but a little bit different characteristics, different care abouts and so that's one but what we're seeing most of the time, honestly is that we're landing with multiple modules.
The vision even if somebody doesn't buy them all at once the vision is already planted that they want to expand to multi module use provided the landing zone [indiscernible]. I love the fact that we are so consistent with that landing zone and means that we're not sort of elephant hunting and now we're staying focused in our suit spot. We know the product tastes so good when somebody gets it, and it just expands rapidly.
So I'm really pleased with that. But that the module expansion comes in two different ways. Some of its super straightforward off of the initial sort of vision we plan with the customer. And other ones take a little more time, the larger customers take a little more time, but obviously, they pay off too, because the size of those companies can be quite large when they're multibillion dollar businesses.
Overall just looking at that growth, three plus module growth where we have nearly $500,000, average ARR per customer, and growing year-over-year, I think we grew it from maybe about 30% of our customer base to now over 40%. That's just a great progress. And we expect it to continue. I'd be surprised if we weren't picking up another chunk of percent of our customer base over the next six to nine months. We're doing well with it, and we're excited with the progress. Yes. No, you can see that even that infrastructure grows and 30%. Congrats. I mean, those are great numbers. And thanks for taking my questions, guys. Appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. Next question today is coming from Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. And congrats on the quarter. And also, congrats on the two year mark of the IPO. It seems like two years has gone fast. But I think we have a lot to look forward to in the future here. So congrats on both those milestones. Obviously the success that you're having John, you just alluded to customers with three or more modules than you were 500k. And I know historically, you've said your I think your overall base monitors like 15% to 20% of their applications. But if you really move into full stack monitoring, full stack observability, is there a different way to think about penetration in these customers beyond just the number of apps monitor? Yes, Matt. So the way we look at it, is that pretty much every customer starts in a segment. It's usually their most advanced cloud environment where they want to Dynatrace in there, the more dynamic, more complex environments where there's lots of blind spots, but there's also a lot of impact if they get it right, but that quickly expands to them to either other app stacks, cloud app stacks, or hybrid. And so digital transformers one of their characteristics is that they're moving from something to something, otherwise, why are you transforming?
So they usually have multiple generations. And so we start out, as we've talked about before, in the most advanced cloud environments, and then we come back and sort of sweep through the hybrid elements that supply those modern cloud applications. So that characterizes sort of the way things look to us, and it's hard to sort of peg Oh our customers are here, or is there a different sort of expansion. The fact is digital transformation, as I said, is a journey.
People are moving from everything they had before, to something brand new on the other end of this. It will take them a long time, and the minute they're there, they're going to continue to evolve. So I see this is we're in early innings. It doesn't really matter, sort of exactly what things look like today. They will continue to evolve and scale rapidly. I mean just look at the cloud companies, and how fast they're all growing at some at massive multi billion dollars worth of revenue. There is just a great opportunity ahead of us and where we're certainly lead at the enterprise space. And we expect to continue to do that and with that will come growth across all the modules as we expand our sort of footprint, our capabilities and our reach into these customers. Got it. Thank you. And then, as we start to look forward to the federal year end it was great to see you awarded the AWS government competency along with your prior FedRAMP authorization. Can you remind us of what your exposure is to Fed spending and how do you think about that into sort of your guidance in terms of like what sort of expectations you have on federal this year? Yes. No, I think we think the federal market is a fantastic opportunity for us to continue expanding in. We are relatively early in that. I think we talked about it about a year ago, in fact, the doubling down that we were doing. We now have quite a good sized team there. It's considerably well over 100% year-on-year. The progress we are making is significant, but it still offers small numbers.
I think is going to be more meaningful in fiscal 23 and 24 honestly, as far as a overall piece of the business, but we're really pleased with the progress that team has made. And we look forward to some great things from them, with partnerships that we're building with, with some of the extensions and some of the new modules, we're bringing out like the app stack module, these are things that said Fed government extremely well, at this moment in time. And so we're looking for great things from them. It's an important thrust. Now, it certainly seems like the government needs to digitally transform just as much as the commercial side. So well done, guys. Thank you. Thank you. Next question today is coming from [indiscernible] from Bank of America. Your line is live. Hey, John. Hey, Kevin, really nice quarter. Congratulations. Thanks for taking my questions. I actually wanting to dig into the prior question on that the AWS government competency award congratulations on that. Great testament to the platform's capability. I guess I was just wondering, could you tell us a little bit about what the process is like for an achieving that award? How long does it take? I mean what goes on with that process of getting a word of that competency award? Yes. that's it, that's a competency that is not really about some technical review. It's actually more about success with joint customers that you earn in the field. So that's a little bit more what that's that one's about. We have a great relationship with the AWS federal community. It's not just AWS themselves as the partners and that whole community there. And we have that with the other hyperscalers as well. But we were pleased to get that. It's a great calling card but it's winning business doesn't just come in the door. You still have to go earn it. And as I just finished we're leaning into it hard, because we see it as a massive opportunity for us. I mean, I think everybody knows, the U.S. federal government spends is probably like that the sixth country in the world as far as spend, IT spend, and they are digitally transforming. Slowly, but hopefully, we can help them to speed it up. Got it. Got it. Thank you. And just one follow up from me looking at the results it really demonstrates the power of the Dynatrace platform and the strong positioning within the overall opportunity. I guess just looking out into the future what is getting you most excited maybe from a product standpoint, or an opportunity standpoint that we should be thinking about? Thank you for taking my questions. Sure. Well, I think the thing that excites us that there's two dimensions to it overall. I mean, of course, the cloud spend continues to go skyrocket. So that's sort of the under underpinning, but that can float many boats. I think, from our perspective two things. The first one is that apps continue to be the high ground. You don't put a cloud platform and unless you're going to put applications on it and you're not going to be able to digitally transform unless you're driving continuous innovation on top of those platforms. So the apps are where the strategic action is and we're super good at it and extending then to the full stack cloud stack is just gravy for us. The other piece is that these clouds are extremely complicated.
And everyone needs to de-risk their cloud programs and as they do that, they're going to look to automation and AI to help drive consistency, allow their best resources to extend themselves further. And that's perfect for us. I mean that's part of our reinvention. We're the first to realize that the scale and complexity was going to outstrip human ability to keep up and we built analytics at the core, some very sophisticated analytics at the core of our platform to handle that data explosion that's going on, that complexity explosion. So that's the other one is that that's finally starting to resonate up at the buying community, not just that at the technical practitioners. And that's super exciting because that's a big differentiator for us and one that is certainly helping us consistently win against all competition no matter who's there ahead of us. Great. Thanks, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Really, really great quarter. Congratulations again. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Next question today is coming from Jonathan Ruykhave from Baird. Your line is live. Yes, well, good morning. I am wondering if you could talk about pricing. You guys have really been able to command a premium for your products. But just curious on your thoughts on how comfortable you are with that pricing strategy just in light of the increasing number of resource consumption based pricing models we see from various competitors. Yes, I think there's a little bit and sort of too much noise about pricing in the market, honestly. We really haven't seen that much change. Some people try to use pricing as a sort of deflection for lack of momentum in their business. But we haven't really seen much sort of impact, their shifts in pricing it's certainly not at the enterprise or the digital transformer level of the marketplace. We're aggressive where we need to be aggressive. We are consistent and predictable for enterprise customers. The thing that they hate most is our overages or things that they can't anticipate, and all of a sudden they get a bill for it. We live in this space. We know how these folks think. We structure our pricing and packaging appropriately for them. And we don't see sort of any reason to move too far off of that what's working for us at this point, nor do we see a moment in time ahead of us where we're sort of worried that all of a sudden something dramatic has changed. So I like where we are. I think we're smart, anticipate where the market is. And we listen to our customers, and make sure that we're predictable and transparent with them. That's helpful John. Thank you. Just a second question I have is just a business analytics product. I know it's relatively new but curious if you're seeing any the emergence of a consistent use case that can drive you a more repeatable sales motion or is it more one off applications that you're staying with that product? No, it's one of our, it's one of the modules that drives some of the three plus module expansion that we talked about. When you think about it nobody really wants to put cloud infrastructure. They don't really want to monitor logs. They don't, what they're trying to do is they're trying to expand their business. They're trying to be more agile and more innovative, find new revenue streams, transform the business itself. And so they put all this in, in order to accomplish something, but you still need to measure, are you getting the customer experience you're expecting? Are you getting the business outcomes you're expecting? And that's where the business analytics piece and the digital experience pieces come in. They measure exactly what the value is on the output the business value. So you can understand whether your investments you're making in the cloud platform, and the applications are paying off. And if they're not paying off, why not and what do you have to do to get that kind of return on investment for your IT digital transformation spent. So it's a really important module for us. It'll continue to be and I do think more and more of the digital transformers are waking up to the fact that it's not just about the infrastructure they're putting in. It's measuring the value at the other end. Very helpful. Thanks, John. Thank you. Next question today is coming from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is now live. Hey thank you. John a quick question on the security on app stack you talked about the early progress there. How do you see that playing out in terms of the behavior you see from some of the security guys because it looks like they are realizing as well that getting data out of security will be more and more important. I mean, you will seem like more than natural hub like how do you see evolving over time. And then I have one follow up for Kevin. Yes. Well, the reason that we entered where we did is we see it as a greenfield space it's very hard to do continuous scanning in production without overhead. We have a fantastic instrumentation technology out in the and we see everything, code level detail, we see every entry and every exit point. So we have a visibility that is really unprecedented. And the second thing we do is we have the intelligence built in, an AI engine, that allows you to actually score determine what's really a vulnerability and what's not, and then score those vulnerabilities. So you can always keep things prioritized for sort of the limited time your Dev team has to spend on this on the security side of things. So that combination is very unique.
And while others are trying to figure out just how to scan in production we're already there. And we already and we have the AI engine to help make it to simplify that world. So it's a great place to come in. we have plans behind it of course, but we believe if we stay in that application, that cloud application zone, first of all, it's going to be a rapidly expanding space. It's being disrupted tremendously. And we have a very unique sort of angle in from the observability, the intelligent observability we do. So we're focused more on what we're doing and how to maximize the value of it with the customers we have rather than worrying too much about what competitors are doing at the moment. And I think that strategy has served us well in the past and we'll continue to pursue it. So far, so good and what we hear back from the hundreds of trials we've been doing is this is spot on we needed. How fast can you mature, so we can roll it out and volume. Perfect place to be. Yes, sounds really exciting. And one for you, Kevin, as we talk more about like RPO going forward, I know you said here are the most important for you. But RPO will come up more and more than are there any kind of drivers or trends that we should see? I'm just if you think short term versus long term RPO. So your long term RPO going faster than short term. Is there, like some duration benefits you see from bigger engagement and longer engagement customers, etc? Thank you. So I was having, so as we've moved to a fully subscription business, we have seen a slight uptick in our average contract duration and right now it's approaching about two years. So that's sort of generally where we are from that standpoint. But the reason we focus investors back on ARR is we've gone out to our customers, and we're signing multiyear agreements. But as they rip and replace existing contracts it's sort of resets the RPO numbers and deferred revenue and the billings numbers as well.
So over the next couple of years as we scale our customer base as we get them on to three year agreements, and as they grow, it's just going to continue to create some variability in those different metrics which is why if you really want to cut through all the noise around everything, we think ARR is the best metric. It's the leading indicator to subscription revenue growth and the one we certainly focus on internally in our company. Okay, make sense. Congrats. Thank you. Next question is coming from Tyler Radke from Citigroup. Your line is now live. Hi. Good morning, everybody. So I wanted to ask you first just on the new logos that you're seeing in the market obviously a nice bounce back from Q1 a year ago. What are you just seeing in terms of their appetite to take on kind of the full Dynatrace platform? Do you find that your landing with a broader set of solutions given the investments that you're doing? Just give us a flavor for how those conversations have progressed. Yes. No, appreciate that. So it's about a third of the customers land with a platform approach three plus module kind of approach. And that's up year-on-year. So that maybe one item to take away. That's because the rise of this observability as a concept sort of landing zone. Two years ago, we talked about the application landing zone. Now, we talked about in observability landing zone, which is a little wider and we see that continuing. It'd be surprised if that isn't scaling up consistently quarter-on-quarter now for the next 12 to 24 months.
So that's an important characteristic. And I think that customers are as they start to move, we starting to see more, do it yourself kind of customers that are tired of trying to cobble things together. It's sort of a game that you just can never get on top of. You feel like you're always behind and customers feel that way. And when they find out that we already do all this and it's all automatic and AI to help them really transform the way they work.
They are totally willing and happy to give up the do-it-yourself approach. That's the other characteristic I'd say that's, that's important. It means that people have already figured out the clouds complex. They've already figured out that old tools don't work. That's why they're in this cobbling it together zone.
And the more we find customers there again I think that multi module footprint will continue to expand in the landing zone. So those are a couple of characteristics of those new logos that we're starting to see and what the dynamics are in those environments.
And I think just with the visibility we see ahead of us, we think that the momentum we've saw this quarter, and maybe it's not a 50% quarter-over-quarter, I'm sorry, year-over-year uptick, but we do see as good, steady, strong new logo flow throughout this year. Probably a little bit ahead of our 15% to 20% guidance, long term guidance we've been giving. Right, and just one follow up, as you think about your kind of mix of expansion and new deals in TAM that are tied to obviously application modernization, like, how is that mixed between public cloud kind of public cloud native applications versus maybe hybrid cloud or private cloud just kind of obviously you talked about some really nice momentum with the hyper scalars. But just kind of curious how that mix of where these applications deployed has changed kind of between the hybrid, private versus public cloud. Sure, well. So there's definitely a trend towards more and more public cloud just in general and people put hybrid clouds in not because they're going to lock down on hybrid is that they're transitioning or transforming their environment over time. Every hybrid cloud that we run into has public cloud extensions. It wasn't that way five years ago, but it is today. Over 80% of our customers are observing cloud native applications and containerized environments.
So it's extremely modern set of tech stacks but they also reach back into data sources of record that are required just to run their business. In an insurance company, it's a risk management system, that's probably running on a mainframe somewhere or some other kind of mid range systems behind their firewall.
They have to reach back to banks, their customer data, transaction data, etc. Airlines, you go down the list of the digital transformers, you realize that there are data sources of record that need to be tapped in order to support the modern cloud front ends and mobile applications we all use. So the way we think about it is that over 80% of customers are modern cloud environments. And it's from our perspective, digital transformers will be hybrid, highly hybrid for some years to come. We are extremely well-positioned for that world and helping them move from the old to the new. Thank you. Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Erik Suppiger from JMP Securities. Your line is now live. Yes. Thanks for taking the question. And Congrats. On the app stack module now that you've been selling that for a little bit. Can you talk a little bit about the competitive environment? Are you seeing the likes of kind of the broad solution providers like Palo Alto or was it more startups and then secondly you've talked a little bit about sales and marketing from the year ago quarter in light of some return to the office. Can you talk a little bit about where you are in terms of your sales organization returning to a more normalized spending level? Sure. I'll try to handle these relatively quickly because I know are short of time here. From an app stack standpoint as I said -- we're still in sort of the maturing and sort of early stages of sales development but we do know what that competitive environment looks like. And no matter what people have they have gaps in production and every one of these customers sort of knows what this landscape looks like. It's about lots of tools out there.
There's plenty of them. But this is a greenfields angle that we're coming in on. There is nobody that's doing what we're doing. It is a hole. And as you guys know from security if there's a hole somewhere, and you're a public company, or a government agency you're going to need to fill it.
And so that's what gives us a lot of excitement around this space. Our timing is good. The angle we're coming in on is good. It is greenfield and yes there is lots of tools out there that people want to talk about when it comes down to does it work? The answer is there's a big gap in the market.
On the sales front, so the sales organization is chomping at the bit to get back here to face to face with customers and there's plenty of customers that are looking forward to that as well and already engaging. In fact, I think some of our travel is for sales in particular is up a big jump from where we were when we were all locked down a year ago.
So they're excited about it. But what I leave you with is this we don't have to be face to face with customers to be successful. We already checked that box a year ago. And we've learned how to win with zoom, over zoom. And we can continue to do it. If anything, back to sort of a little more normalcy and face to face will be an accelerant for us both in onboarding new talent as well as I believe building relationships with customers that allow us to expand faster. So those are some of the characteristics but either way it goes whether it's a protracted pandemic or whether we're back to normal sooner it's all good from our perspective. Very good, thank you. Great. Hey well , thank you everyone for joining us. We're thrilled with the dynamics of the market moving toward us as I said in my prepared remarks. We're excited about our ability to invest in growth, both commercial expansion and innovation. And we believe that as long as we stay focused on our two key metrics the expansion and new logos and the expansion of our ARR per customer that we can grow a fantastic business for years to come. So thanks again and I look forward to catching up a quarter from now. Cheers. Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference webcast.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Noelle Faris, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Dynatrace's second quarter fiscal '22 earnings conference call.

A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP measures can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. And with that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, John Van Siclen. John? Thanks, Noelle. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. First, let me start by sharing how extremely proud I am with the team's performance this quarter. Once again, beating guidance across all our key operating metrics. ARR was $864 million, up 35% year-over-year and subscription revenue was $213 million, also up 35% year-over-year. Once again, we balance these strong top line metrics with solid bottom line performance as well, which Kevin will elaborate on a few minutes.
We continue to believe that a smart balance between growth and profitability makes for a more durable business. Underpinning our consistent year-over-year top line ARR growth above 30% are two key building blocks net new logos to the Dynatrace platform and the ongoing expansion of existing customers. I'm pleased to report that we added 160 new logo customers to the Dynatrace platform in Q2 up 20% from a year-ago.
And that net expansion rate fueled by growth across all modules was once again at or above 120%. The consistent execution against these two building blocks we believe will sustain a 30 plus percent growth business at scale for some years to come.
With the strength of our Q2 results and positive outlook ahead, we're increasing our guidance for fiscal 2022, which Kevin will provide more detail on shortly.
This morning, I'd like to provide an update on the three topics that I believe will continue to drive Dynatrace's momentum and success. First, the ongoing market dynamics that continue to drive new logo growth and rapid expansion within our growing customer base. Second, the progress we're making in commercial expansion to accelerate go-to-market success. And third, the progress we are making and expanding our platform and module strength to address the full $50 billion TAM, we see ahead of us.
Let me start with the market dynamics. We sit in a rapidly growing market. It's being driven by digital transformation across every geography and vertical. IDC predicts digital transformation investments will exceed $7 trillion by 2023 and the pandemic whether protracted or short lived has little effect on this movement.
At the core of digital transformation are three mega trends that are interrelated. The first is that applications are eating the world as businesses look for innovative ways to transform. The second is that these applications and the platforms they run on our Cloud First, in fact multicloud-first and the third is the rise of automation and AI to simplify the complexity, increase the speed and mitigate the risk of these transformations.
Dynatrace's unique combination of multicloud observability and application security unified with powerful AIOps capabilities position us to benefit nicely from all three of these megatrends. Digital transformation is not an event. It's a journey and we are in the early innings of digital transformation and these three mega trends.
Take one of our brick and mortar retail customers who is shifting more business online, increasing customer loyalty and optimizing supply chains, all while reducing their real estate footprint dramatically. Leveraging digital channels at scale will be a long-term imperative for increasing profitability, while reducing business risk for years to come.
Another example, one of our media entertainment customers, who is digitizing their entire library of video assets, extending their online licensing capabilities, and leveraging public cloud for scale and flexibility. New digital partnerships, new revenue streams and powerful new branding opportunities will fuel their business well into the future.
For one of our U.S. Federal customers, who is on a multi-year journey to migrate hundreds of applications from legacy data centers to a modern multicloud platform for greater agility, efficiency and security, application effectiveness and responsiveness needs to be maintained while scale increases functionality advances and mobile access becomes a primary channel of engagement.
These are just a few of the 1000s of customers Dynatrace is helping to modernize and transform, modern cloud native application stacks, multicloud platforms, AIOps enabled for ease and efficiency.
Our numbers are proof of our superior fit for these digital transformers. As I mentioned earlier, we added 160 new logos to our franchise in Q2 up from 135 last quarter, and up 20% year-over-year. Great companies and agencies such as HCA, Victoria's Secret, PG&E, and the FAA, all digitally transforming in one way or another all with observability requirements that include hyper scalar platforms Kubernetes container orchestration, Cloud native applications and modern DevOps practices.
Some of these accounts are transforming of outdated monitoring tools, while others have been trying to cobble together their own modern cloud observability solutions, and all considered multiple alternatives before selecting Dynatrace as their digital transformation partner.
On the expansion front, once customers experience the value of the Dynatrace platform, they are eager to expand module usage and increased coverage. This quarter global leaders such as Hertz, MasterCard, Bell Canada, American Airlines, and U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs expanded their use of Dynatrace and all now use three plus modules of Dynatrace to cover their multicloud observability needs.
As digital transformations expand, as applications drive more and more value for the business, as scale and complexity accelerates faster than human expertise, the Dynatrace value advantage gets stronger and stronger.
As you heard us say in the past, we believe the market is moving toward us. The macro trends of applications eating the world, digital transformations Cloud First, and the need for automation and AIOps capabilities on the rise put us in a very strong position for continued new logo and that expansion success going forward.
This brings me to my second topic this morning, increasing investment in commercial expansion to capture the powerful market opportunity in front of us. We continue to invest aggressively to grow our salesforce, expand our partner relationships and increase awareness of the Dynatrace brand in the market.
Our ability to attract talent to Dynatrace has never been stronger. We grew our quota carriers by over 30% this past quarter, and expect to continue growing this team at or above 30% for the foreseeable future. Our market is strong. Our products are well differentiated, our customers are happy and there's plenty of room for expansion, a great combination if you're an experienced seller.
One of the most exciting market expansion opportunities we have underway is our doubling down in the U.S. federal market. This is a huge market, with the U.S. government projected spend over $7 billion this year alone on cloud platforms. Over the past 12 months, our U.S. Federal ARR has more than doubled as we win new agencies and expand across our growing number of U.S. Federal customers. So still early in our penetration of this massive market, our investments are paying off.
Helping to accelerate our success with both government agencies and commercial accounts is our growing portfolio of partners. We continue to invest in cloud system integrators and strategic tech partner alliances and the results are strong. Our partner community is now influencing nearly 50% of our transactions globally. And the leverage we are seeing through the hyperscale and marketplaces continues to grow even more rapidly. In fact, the growth in ARR through hyperscale and marketplaces has more than doubled year-over-year.
Our reputation for reducing risk and accelerating project success, especially for projects of scale continues to catch the eye in more and more partners and the community members an exciting opportunity for us as we scale beyond $1 billion business.
Market and brand awareness continues to be an important component of our sales and partner go-to-market efforts. We often leverage the voice of the customer, or third party experts to tell our story. Keeping with this approach in Q2, ISG named Dynatrace, the leader in cloud native observability.
GigaOm named Dynatrace leader and outperformer for AIOps Solutions, and Gartner rated Dynatrace highest for application performance monitoring in their 2021 peer insights review. The recognition by these experts for leadership across various dimensions of modern cloud observability is gratifying, and helps clarify our value advantage for the market.
The third and final topic I'd like to cover today is a continuous investment in innovation in both the Dynatrace platform and its growing number of monetizable modules. As observability becomes a primary market requirement. Our three plus module customer count continues to climb. Now over 40% of our growing base. We are landing and expanding with full stack for apps and microservices, plus infrastructure for hyperscaler platforms metrics and logs, plus digital experience for mobile more and more often.
Our landing ARR is gradually increasing. And our average ARR for three plus module customers is nearly $500,000. With AppSec and cloud automation modules kicking in over the next few quarters, we see a great opportunity to both increase the value of our landing zone as well as expand ARR per customer materially.
Behind these advances is an extremely strong organic innovation engine. This team anticipated the massive disruption, modern dynamic clouds would have on the IT ops, software development and digital business landscapes, and they continue to lead in the cloud automation, [indiscernible] AI and data analytics the Global 15,000 need for continued digital transformation success.
To augment this team and accelerate our innovation roadmap, we may do technology tuck-in acquisitions from time-to-time. Our recent acquisition of SpectX, which closed in September is a great example of strong technology fit and team fit to accelerate our value and differentiation across both platforms and modules. A high performance parsing and analytics engine SpectX will continue to accelerate the convergence of observability and security used cases as a cloud continues to disrupt classic approaches.
Going forward, where the fittest strong and roadmaps could be meaningfully accelerated. We continue to augment our organic innovation engine in a smart way.
With that, let me summarize, as I've covered several important topics this morning. It's an exciting time for Dynatrace, as we fire on all cylinders. We have an incredible long-term market opportunity, and we are investing aggressively to seize the advantage.
Commercial expansion is strong, and our product differentiation is increasing. We're gaining new digital transformer logos at a steadily increasing rate and the net expansion of our base across multiple modules continues to be robust. We are building a long-term category leader with the building blocks to sustain a 30% plus growth business well into the future.
Now, let me turn it over to Kevin to take us into our financial results and guidance. Kevin. Thank you, John. And good morning everyone. As John mentioned, we delivered another great quarter on both the top and bottom line, setting this up for stronger fiscal '22. The investments we have made in sales productivity and commercial expansion are evident across all of our top line metrics with ARR above our internal expectations and revenue and subscription revenue exceeding our guidance.
ARR for the second quarter was $864 million. That's up $226 million year-over-year representing 35% growth or 34% in constant currency. Excluding the perpetual license headwind, which was roughly $25 million. Our adjusted ARR growth rate was 39% on an as reported basis, and 38% on a constant currency basis. That's up 200 basis points sequentially from Q1.
Please keep in mind our ARR as reported was impacted by currency movements and I will cover that component when I review the full-year ARR guide. The building blocks for sustained ARR growth remained the same. The addition of new logos to the Dynatrace platform combined with the ability to expand existing customer relationships, as measured by our net expansion rate.
As John discussed, new logo growth continues to be strong, and it was up 33% for the first half to 295 new logos. We continue to see positive traction across all of our regions. With notable strength in EMEA and North America. We ended the quarter with more than 3100 Dynatrace customers.
At the same time, existing customers continue to see the value of the Dynatrace platform, adopting new modules and expanding coverage. This is evident in our net expansion rate, which for the 14th consecutive quarter was at or above 120%.
As a result, our ARR per Dynatrace customer continues to increase. And in Q2, it was $277,000, an increase of 19% year-over-year. In addition, we continue to see strong momentum in the number of customers that are leveraging the Dynatrace platform for full scale observability defined as customers using three or more modules.
At the end of Q2, more than 40% of our customers were using three or more modules with an average ARR of nearly $500,000. We now have over 1300 customers using three modules, and this cohort has increased by well over 400 customers over the past year.
Moving on to revenue. Total revenue for the second quarter was $226 million, $5 million above the high end of our guidance and representing an increase of 34% on a year-over-year basis, or 33% in constant currency.
Subscription revenue for the second quarter was $213 million, $5 million above the high end of our guidance, representing an increase of 35% on a year-over-year basis, or 33% in constant currency.
With respect to margins, total non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter was 85%, in line with last quarter and Q2 of last year. As we have said before, a very healthy margin reflecting the value and efficiency of the Dynatrace platform.
Overall, we are extremely pleased with the strength of both our ARR growth and revenue performance. We believe this further validates that our strategy to continue to increase investments to grow our top line is the right path and you will continue to see us lean in to both commercial expansion and technology innovation to capture the large and growing market opportunity ahead of us.
As a result, we invested $32 million in R&D this quarter, that's up over 33% from last year and approaching our targeted R&D investment level of 15% of revenue. On the commercial side, we invested $76 million in sales and marketing this quarter, up 52% over the last year and within our target investment zone for sales and marketing of 34% to 36% of revenue.
Even with these levels of increased investments, we continue to run a balanced business. Our non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $61 million, $6 million above the high end of our guidance range due primarily to the revenue upside that flowed through to the bottom line. This resulted in a non-GAAP operating margin of 27%, compared to 32% in the second quarter of last year. Again, keep in mind, we saw significant savings in the first half of last year related to the COVID shutdown. And we continue to invest for growth and innovation. On the bottom line, non-GAAP net income was $52 million or $0.18 per share.
Turning to the balance sheet, as of September 30, we had $370 million of cash, an increase of $122 million, compared to the same period last year. We are pleased with our continued healthy cash generation and believe it puts us in a strong position to consider strategic business investments where there's an opportunity to accelerate our growth in select areas as we did with SpectX this past quarter.
Year-to-date, our unlevered free cash flow was $93 million, up 20% compared to the same period last year. As a reminder, due to seasonal variability, we believe it's best to view unlevered free cash flow on a full-year basis.
On a trailing 12-month basis, our unlevered free cash flow was $252 million, or 31% of revenue.
The last financial measure that I would like to mention is our remaining performance obligation, which at the end of the quarter was approximately $1.3 billion, an increase of 42% over Q2 of last year.
The current portion of RPO which we expect to recognize as revenue over the next four quarters was $719 million. An increase of 38% year-over-year. Though our RPO may become a more meaningful metric force in the future, we continue to believe ARR is the best metric to understand the performance of the business as it removes variability associated with billings and contracts.
Moving on to guidance, as I outlined last quarter, we believe the investments we're making in commercial expansion and product innovation will enable us to maintain 120% net expansion and at least 15% to 20% new logo growth over the mid-term. These are the core building blocks that support ARR growth of 30% plus. With respect to fiscal '22, ARR as reported is expected to be between $986 million and $996 million up 27% to 29% year-over-year.
As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, our as reported ARR guidance was impacted by currency movement. To be specific, there was about $15 million or roughly 200 basis points of headwind to our as reported ARR guidance when comparing to previous guidance. To eliminate the FX impacts, I think investors should focus on our constant currency guide, which we're increasing 29% to 30% year-over-year. This is an increase of 250 basis points at the midpoint of the range.
Also, keep in mind, our ARR guidance assumes roughly 300 basis points of headwind to ARR growth rates in fiscal '22 due to the perpetual license wind down. We expect the third quarter to be roughly 450 basis points of headwind and then it will decline to about 300 basis points in Q4 and continue to decline thereafter. Excluding the perpetual license headwind, our full-year adjusted ARR growth rate is expected to be between 32% to 33% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. This is also an increase of 250 basis points compared to what we communicated last quarter.
Moving onto revenue, similar to ARR but not quite as pronounced currency had a $7 million negative impact to our previous as reported revenue and subscription revenue guidance. Despite that headwind based on the strength of ARR, we're raising our revenue guidance for the full-year. We expect total revenue to be between $913 million to $919 million, up 30% to 31% year-over-year or 29% to 30% in constant currency.
We're raising our subscription revenue guidance, now expected to be between $857.5 million and $862.5 million up 31% to 32% year-over-year or 30% to 31% in constant currency. It's also an increase of 250 basis points at the midpoint of the guidance range for both metrics when compared to our previous guidance. We continue to expect subscription revenue to be 94% of total revenue driven by the size and strength of ARR and associated subscription revenue growth.
Moving down to P&L, we expect full-year non-GAAP operating income to be between $219 million and $226 million. As we have been communicating, we are investing for durable growth of the business. We believe a proper levels of investment for sales and marketing to be in a range of 34% to 36% of revenue and R&D to be around 15% of revenue. The results of which is a non--GAAP operating margin of 24% to 24.5% of revenue for the year, up roughly one point when compared to our prior guidance and not from a $1 standpoint due to the higher revenue guidance. For the full-year we expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.63 to $0.65 per share up $0.02 on the high end of our previous guidance due to our revenue over performance.
Our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS calculations assume a non-GAAP effective cash tax rate of 12% consistent with prior guidance. At these investment levels we're able to continue delivering strong unlevered free cash flow margins. For the year we're raising our unlevered free cash flow slightly to be between $263 million to $275 million or approximately 29% to 30% of revenue. To summarize our full-year guidance, there is a continuation of our durable balance of growth and profitability, guiding to a rule of 50 plus business when combining ARR growth and another free cash flow margin.
Quickly looking at Q3, we expect total revenue to be between $233 million and $235 million up 27% to 28% year-over-year or 28% to 29% in constant currency. Subscription revenue is expected to be between $219.5 million and $221 million up 29% to 30% year-over-year or 30% to 31% in constant currency. From a profit standpoint, non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $54 million and $56 million, resulting in an operating margin of 23% to 24% of revenue as we continue to execute on our investment strategy.
Finally, we expect non-GAAP EPS to be $0.16 per share. In summary, we're very pleased with the overall momentum of our second quarter performance with strong ARR and top-line growth combined with healthy margins. As John mentioned, we have an incredible long-term market opportunity ahead of us. And we're investing aggressively in commercial expansion to accelerate go-to-market success and in our platform to further strengthen our RD robust module offerings. Overall, we're well positioned for sustained and durable growth in fiscal '22 and beyond.
And with that, we'll open the line for questions. Operator? Thank you. We'll now be conducting your question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Great. Thanks guys for taking my questions. Congrats on the quarter the adjusted currency ARR acceleration on a sequential basis, it was super impressive. John, I guess, as you alluded to in your script, one of the biggest drivers seems to be the growth in just cloud applications and workload. And I wonder if you could talk about that dynamic a bit more really in the scope of the hyperscale sort of the size and scale? All of this isn't that new workload? I guess the question also was, what does this mean for the percentage of deals that are really Greenfield today, in what I think a lot of people see as a more competitive market for observability solutions? Well, thank you, Matt. And good question. You're right in that. We're seeing the Greenfield space increase for us. As this market expands, and shifts from sort of a tool layered market into an observability market. The dynamic cloud environments that our customers find themselves in now, they realize that old tooling isn't something that they can live with it actually fails, they actually fail.
And so there's a scramble for new tooling. Many of the customers start with just trying to cobble things together themselves. And when we show up, it's a pretty open opportunity for us to provide a platform approach that accelerates their ability to regain control over their environment, which gives them the kind of visibility they need to scale faster and at lower risk. So we're seeing that that Greenfield actually open up for us from what we saw when we first IPO a couple years ago. And it is accelerating growth in a number of areas. That's super helpful. And then maybe as a follow-up, the - you continue to add new sales rep at a rapid pace. I guess I'm wondering, what is the plan for sales reps getting back on the road face-to-face meetings? And if they do so to a greater extent, do you think that could have start to have a positive sort of incremental benefit to pipeline generation? Well, we're already back on the road actually, and around the world, and the sales organizations been pretty sort of thoughtful and but aggressive that's re-engaging both customers, as well as prospect opportunities. And I do believe with our direct approach to the global 15,000 especially since we call on sort of director level and above in organizations that that the direct face-to-face will help accelerate pipelines especially in the new logo area. Thank you. Next question is coming from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is now live. Hey, thank you. Congrats from me as well. Can I stay on that topic a little bit, John? If you think about the sales expansion and the new functionalities you're getting there, it's like how do you think about that motion around sales expansion in terms of overly kind of specialized on the new modules versus kind of guy to kind of tell the whole portfolio? And then follow-up for Kevin there's like you expanded the sales by 30%, what's the notion? Or what's the situation on sales productivity? How's that tracking for you? Thank you. Sure, well so most of our sellers, back all the direct sellers handle the entire portfolio. So there's no confusion over who's calling on what account or how we manage agreements with customers, there's no friction at the point of customer and that's, we think that that's very important. There are certain most products are actually very similar in that they complement various dimensions of observability.
The only outlier is the AppSec module, which does have a separate overlay team to help with some of the specialized selling skills around security, especially with the CISOs. So that's the only one but we're getting great cross sell now, a year and a half ago, we talked about, hey, when we're done with our conversion program, we'll lean into cross sell, and we built quite strong muscle there.
And you can see those in the numbers, the fact that three plus modules continue to climb every quarter at a steady pace. And that's without really sort of AppSec and the new cloud automation module kicking in yet. So we just see that, that that our motion is strong, the sales organization and partner organizations have embraced it.
And we're executing well to that multi-module strategy that we talked about two years ago, and are now executing against today. Hi, Raimo, Kevin. Just to follow-up on your question around productivity. So first of all, it's been great over the last couple of years, as you know, we've been stepping on the gas in terms of the sales acceleration growing that organization 20%, 25% in this past quarter growing 30 plus percent. So super excited there. I'd also say that's noteworthy is we're doing a great job, given the company's brand visibility awareness of attracting great talent across the organization.
And we've invested a lot in onboarding and bringing those people up to speed as well. So that whole commercial engine is working extremely well, we obviously keep an eye on productivity, I think generally our view on productivity is if we start to see it creeping up too much, then what we want to do is probably go out and lay around a few more sales reps. To keep productivity relatively flat, our goal is not to lean on certain part of the organization too heavily. We want everybody to be productive. And when we sort of hit productivity levels, we step on the gas a little bit more. Okay, perfect. Thank you. Well done. Thank you. Next question today is coming from DJ Hynes from Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now live. Hey, thanks guys. And congrats also in the quarter, John, is the partner influence deals continue to increase as a part of the mix, right via through the size of the hyperscalers. Is there any notable difference in the typical profile of those deals versus what you're attracting and closing directly? DJ no, not really. We've had this partner of Operation for quite a while now. And it does take a little while to get them up to speed and gain momentum. But they really become quite a strong augmentation to our sales, our direct sales engine. And so the type of deals are relatively similar. What is a little bit different is that the global SI's think of, so they're more general contractors? So their deals will include five, six, 10 different piece parts of an entire cloud transformation project and ecosystem and will be a piece of it.
So from that standpoint, you might say, well, that's different in how they move and what their motion is in the market. But the kind of deal and use cases and so on that they use they bring Dynatrace in for very similar to the kinds of deals we do directly. Yes, okay, that's helpful. And then Kevin as a follow-up. Is there any way to get a bit more granular on the trends you're seeing in dollar base net retention, is it improving? Is it staying the same? I know kind of north of 120 is kind of the default comment. And maybe as part of that, like there are multiple levers to expansion. So maybe just unpack maybe what's having the most impacts there? Sure. So I think some of the visibility we put this out actually in our investor deck, but we break out the expansion between two companies DJ. So if we breakout ARR growth between what's coming from new logos and what's coming from expansion in the base. And if I just sort of mentioned the last couple of quarters, when we've been growing 30 plus percent, 24% growth has been coming from expanding in the base that was in the fourth quarter. And over the last couple of quarters that stepped up.
So in Q2, I'm sorry in Q1, that went to 25%. And then in Q2, that went to 27%. So that's sort of an indicator of that net expansion rate. As you know, we don't specifically give you the net expansion rate, but expansion from the base has been growing, which is contributing to the overall ARR growth. Yes, perfect. Thank you, guys. Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. That's perfect timing. So maybe to segue on that question is, when you look at that net expansion, how much of that is more modules versus more applications? It's actually the module expansion beyond applications is growing a little bit faster than the applications. But I won't say that it's materially faster, because application expansion is, as I've said before, it's sort of an evergreen environment. Everybody's adding more applications, every application is scaling further than it was a quarter or two ago. And so it's because we're consumption based, it continue growth environment for us just in the application side alone.
And we really only have I mean, we still believe we're still early innings we're at most 15% to 20% penetrated in the application areas where we believe that most customers would like to have 50% to 60% of their applications monitored by sort of a deep wide technology like a Dynatrace. So lots of room to grow there, and no question that we have even more room to grow on the module side. So, I think we're just going to, we're doing a good job of executing, but there's so much more room to go. It's a wonderful market. That makes sense. And maybe one quick follow-up, when you look at the new business in the quarter, how would you characterize the mix of that business that's for observability on Azure versus AWS versus GCP versus private cloud versus something else? You know the 80% or so of our customer base, and this includes new logos, at least 80%, probably closer to 90% are coming to us because of our expertise in modern cloud environments, whether they're public cloud, Kubernetes, orchestrated cloud native application environments. It's a combination of all those that really drives our business. The fact that we are extremely strong in the hybrid extension side is just another reason for why the global 15,000, the digital transformers out there, favor Dynatrace. So they can get a real Indian view as they're migrating from the old to the new.
But what drives our business is where companies are headed. And that is modern cloud, modern workload everywhere. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jonathan Ruykhaver from Baird. Your line is now live. Yes, good morning guys. And congrats on the performance. So, John, we're starting to see some of these DevOps platform vendors, notably GitLab talk about their ability to drive value across the entire DevOps lifecycle including observability. And I'm just kind of curious, how you view that position from a DevOps perspective and the focus on that center? Did you view it as a potential competitive impact over time? Well, the short answer is, we don't view it as competitive impact over time because what we do sort of sets up above the CI CD tool chain kind of approach out there. And having intelligent, automated observability along the path and the same sort of tooling between deployment to production to sunsetting of legacy or outdated code at scale requires a little bit different kind of platform, and different kind of approach than sort of that multi-tool approach that pretty much everybody has an including GitLab. So it's a compliment for sure, but not a competitive kind of situation the way we view it. Okay, that's helpful. The second question I have, it might be more for Kevin, but you've talked about potentially churning us a few 100 lower value accounts. So I'm wondering if you could just talk about how that has progressed including - are you seeing success maybe turning those accounts into more meaningful platform customers, and then on the other hand, if you aren't seeing some churn on those customers, anyway to quantify what kind of impact that might be to ARR? Yes, so we've mentioned that there are a few 100 customers that were single module customers, and a lot of these customers have been running one of our synthetic products - with synthetic monitoring products. And we have sort of seen some turnover that in the last couple quarters on that. We also do land some new logos, you know, not want at this point, but some new logos, with single modules, but we've been very successful in terms of growing those customers to multi module more observability players over time.
So yes, we're seeing the churn as we communicated I think in our fourth quarter costs, nothing sort of out of line there. Keep in mind that customer segment when you look at it from an ARR standpoint, it's sort of mid-single million dollar AR number. So not meaningful from an AR standpoint and not meaningful from a customer count standpoint. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jack Andrews from Needham & Company. Your line is now live. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I want to ask maybe a two part question. And the first part is, could you speak to what types of metrics your enterprise customers are focused on deriving from their observability solutions these days, being that is it still just about number of critical incidents and things like me time to resolution, or are they increasingly looking to tie observability to potential business outcomes like measuring net promoter score for example? More and more these customers are trying to tie together sort of the business impact of that, IT platform and tool chain. In other words, measuring results around user experience against different kind of app decks indexes and so on, or relative to conversion rates, or abandoned carts, and that kind of direct connect to business outcomes.
And it's one of the unique and powerful aspects of Dynatrace is that we actually connect the dots between all the rest of the plumbing, all the applications and services with the actual outcomes themselves to give operators a very good well focused approach to how they should optimize where they should troubleshoot, and how they should manage their innovation investments to improve their business results. So it is a growing trend, and one that we're excited about and well positioned for. Well, thanks for the color on that. And just as a quick follow-up. Could you maybe expand on your comments in terms of how you're thinking about M&A in other particular aspects of your platform that you think might make sense to perhaps acquire capabilities rather than the building organically? Yes, great question. Our approach has always been platform first, because we believe that's easier for customers to manage, to operate and we can apply greater degrees of automation and AI against used cases if we sort of manage all the components of that platform. And so technology tuck-ins therefore fit extremely well in that strategy and we've started to do.
We announced our SpectX acquisition. And as we find additional similar kinds of talented teams that can accelerate roadmaps materially will be acquisitive. And it just it makes sense, where we have a large enough portfolio, Kevin talked about sort of the cash generation of the business. And we want to put that to work in whatever way we can to continue to extend our differentiation and drive top line growth. Thank you. Next question today is coming from Koji Ikeda from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Hi, John and Kevin, very nice quarter. And thank you for taking my questions. I guess this is a follow up. We're just to dig in on that M&A strategy. You know, thinking about the SpectX acquisition. It's been about six weeks now since the acquisition closed. So couple of questions here. First, around the technology that was acquired. I guess, how much did it accelerate the roadmap for high speed parsing and analytics for Dynatrace? And as SpectX a good way to think about the inorganic roadmap acceleration strategy? And then I guess, second, it's still early, but how has the initial reaction been with the partners and customers out there? Yes, good question. So first of all, I'd say that from a roadmap standpoint, I'd say 18 to 24-month kind of bump forward, which is significant. Second of all, we believe that first parts of their technology will be infused into our platform in somewhere between six and nine months from closing the acquisition, which is about the right kind of timeframe that we think about when we think tuck-in, and the feedback that we've gotten from customers and partners have been two thumbs up, what's next and what else do you have up your sleeve kind of thing? So, we've done these before, we did one a couple years ago, we found it to be highly successful. And Kevin and I see more in our future where they make sense. Now, they'll be smart. There'll be tuck-ins. And but we'll be aggressive in life as I said extending our differentiation. And driving top line growth. Got it. Thanks, John. And maybe a follow up for Kevin if I may. I was hoping we could dig into the FX impact a bit more. Can you help us understand a bit more granularly around what regions are driving the FX impacts we're seeing right now? Yes, so for the year as I mentioned in the call are as reported guidance was reduced by about $15 million or sort of two percentage points of growth related to FX. A majority of that came as a result of the dollar strengthening primarily against the euro and the pound, and also the Australian dollar. So those are sort of three major currencies that we're operating in, where we saw the currency movement towards the end of the second quarter. So that's sort of resulted in that as reported impact. But as we said in the call, and what we'd like investors to focus on is certainly the constant currency ARR growth, which we increased by about 250 basis points at the midpoint for the years. So trying to normalize out that any of that FX headwind there. Thank you. Next question today is coming from Gray Powell from BTIG. Your line is now live. Great, thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple of my side. So last quarter, you highlighted, I think 45% of customers use infrastructure monitoring outside of full-stack. Any update there? And then for customers that are taking infrastructure monitoring outside of full-stack APM? How much are they spending on the product? Like, if you're spending $100 per year in APM? What does infrastructure add today? And where could it go? Yes, so we just dropped some of the side data, but think of it as about a 5%, increase in the customer base on a quarter-over-quarter basis, I mean, we're doing extremely well, selling cross selling that module in with the full-stack customers. And when you think about how many cents on the dollar versus the full-stack application microservices module, think about it as probably today, maybe we're in the $0.15 to $0.20 on the dollar kind of range. And there, it can clearly be dollar for dollar, there's a lot of infrastructure, kind of workloads in that, by the way is log analytics for us because we package that together in our infrastructure module. So there's a lot of dimensions of expansion for that module with every customer we have. So like I said, we're excited about its maturity. I can go toe-to-toe with anyone and cross-sell is going very well with that module in particular. It's a key driver of the three plus module growth as well. Got it. Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you. Thank you. Next question today is coming from Kamil Mielczarek from William Blair. Your line is now live. Thank you. Hi, congrats on the third quarter. John, you said in the past that a third of customers land with the three or more module platform approach. And you've attributed this, I think, last quarter to the move toward observability as a landing zone away from applications as a landing zone. So in that context, I'd like to better understand how you expect the size of new lands to trend long-term. How do you expect that landing zone to evolve? And is there a point where you choose to limit the growth in new lands in favor of maybe a faster pace of new logo wins and then faster expansion rates? Or should we expect the size of new logo ASPs to trend up for the foreseeable future? That's definitely a key question that we continue to ask ourselves, because the speed of new logo acquisitions is a really important long-term growth driver for us. So that's why you've seen that landing zone stay pretty constant. But I will say when we IPO a couple years ago, it was more in the 90K to 95K. And now it's in the 105K to 110K. So it has been creeping up and that's that creep has been more modules on day one. So the shift to observability definitely has some impact to it.
No question about that. And I do believe that it will continue to creep up. Okay, it won't jump up, but it will creep up. As more and more landing zones are - our observability a broader platform approach, which is today, as you pointed out about a third is that approach is 50% obviously that that that will impact that landing zone number. I think we'll always try to keep it pretty close to the 100K, maybe it gets to 120K, 125K. But, even there, it's still up, it's still not, it's not too high for a billion dollar business, who's digitally transforming to try something new. That just might work better than advertised, fulfill the promises that many have had that have fallen short. So I still think it's in the right zone, but I do expect it to creep up over time. That's helpful. Thank you. And a quick follow-up for Kevin. Current RPO was up in high 30s. Billings on a trailing 12 month basis up close to 40% I think. ARR after adjustments also high 30s. So why aren't we seeing that kind of growth rate in revenue yet? What's causing divergence? And is it fair to expect ARR and revenue growth to converge sometime on next few years? So I think what we're seeing so. So first of all, from an RPO standpoint, yes, I think we're very pleased in the growth of that. We've got implemented one contract, one price. We're also doing a lot of more rip and replace and accelerating growth with our customer base and extending the three-year deal. So that's sort of driving that that RPO growth. But the more important metric, I think, as you appreciate is the ARR growth. And that's been growing nicely. And subscription revenue, I think that's the metric that you need to think about.
And I think those will start to converge, there's a little bit of a dynamic in the subscription revenue do the perpetual license wind down. But as we get through that transition here, over the next quarter - couple of quarters, you will start to see the ARR growth rate and subscription growth rate, essentially marry each other. But I think that's probably four to six quarters away. So there's - there'll be a slight discrepancy between those two metrics at this point. But again, they're both grown pretty nicely and both converge over time. Thank you. Next question today is coming from Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Your line is now live. Hi, thank you. I wanted to focus on security for my first question. Could you give us an update on where you are in terms of potential traction over the next 12 months and going back to the dollar-for-dollar opportunity set? How would you characterize it now that you've had a couple more quarters to at least observe it, and what the potential is, but if you could just give us an update on security including how the recent M&A may impact your thoughts there? And then I have a follow-up if I could. Sure, Keith. So things are still going extremely well with that module. We've introduced it now to about 20% of our customer base, trialed it in about 10%, feedback is still the same that we've heard before, this is a - there's nothing like this is a Greenfield opportunity for us. And it just needed a few sort of pieces to be mature enough for a global 15,000 CISO to approve. And we're at that point now, and a combination of coverage, as well as sort of operational automation, capabilities of how it fits in a DevSecOps environment.
So those have been the two key technology elements to add. We see this quarter are really the second half of this year as a scale up of customers and growth opportunities. But it's still office a super small number, so you won't see it really in any ARR impact until fiscal '23. But that's consistent with what we said about a year ago, when we talked about it, I think it was either December or January that we introduced the AppSec module. And we're on track maybe a little bit ahead of track actually.
As far as acquisitions go and sort of impact over time. Today with the functionality we have, we think it's, we're probably able to capture maybe $0.20 on a full stack dollar. But with the roadmap we have, a year from now we'll be capturing $0.50 on the full stack dollar and where we are two years from now we think it's clearly should be a dollar-for-dollar with the observability suite. Perfect. Okay. A lot of room to scale up. Yes. Well, that relates to [indiscernible] your customers are three plus modules and I think your total module offering is six. How would you think investors should consider what that looks like three years from now? In other words, does your model - module offering double over the next three to five years? Or how should we be thinking about the potential for portfolio expansion over the next three plus years? So first of all, let me just start with the way we package modules is different than others. We packaged by use cases, which includes multiple sort of features and components things other people might call products. We'll package them all around use cases. So, it's a different kind of packaging strategy, which fits our global 15,000 customer a little bit better. So we'll never have a massive amount of modules, but we will continue to gradually increase the modules over time.
I think with the way, we'll end up talking about in this a little speculative, but I think you knew assist are start talking a little bit about four plus module, five plus module customers. But the key I think is the movement of ARR for customer like, how do you go from a landing zone of a 100,000 in ARR to a million dollar ARR, which we believe all of our customers can reach and exceed.
And I think that that's really right now, we're talking about three plus modules, because you can see as close to 500,000, halfway there. You add a fourth and a fifth, and you keep growing. And it's really underpins our thesis of that expansion above 120% for a pretty long time to come. And that's a key part of our entire growth strategy to stay above 30% over the long-term. Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further closing comments. I appreciate your attendance today, support for the business. Just leave you with a few thoughts. First of all, we believe our business has never been stronger. Our - this was our very strong financial quarter for us business results. And one of our stronger guides actually when you take it in constant currency. So we're thrilled about that. Teams extremely strong, proven and our execution ability has never been better as well. So we're thrilled for the future and look forward to catching up at the - at our next call in January or early February when we talk about Q3 results. Thank you very much. Thank you. And that does conclude today's teleconference call and webcast. You may now disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.","the second quarter fiscal 2022 earnings conference call is being recorded . it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to noelle Faris, vice president, Investor Relations . the forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's views on October 27, 2021.",0.0

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded.
At this time, I will now turn the conference over to Noelle Faris, Vice President, Investor Relations. Noelle, you may now begin. Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining Dynatrace's third quarter FY '22 earnings conference call. With me on the call today are Rick McConnell, Chief Executive Officer; and Kevin Burns, Chief Financial Officer.
Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements such as statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, depending on a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Additional information concerning these uncertainties and risk factors is contained in Dynatrace's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's views on February 2, 2022. Dynatrace disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial measures during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP measures can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.
And with that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Rick McConnell. Rick? Thanks, Noelle and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's call. I am very excited to be kicking off what I anticipate will be the first of many positive earnings calls as Dynatrace's CEO. First, I'd like to thank John Van Siclen for his contributions in growing Dynatrace as CEO to nearly $1 billion in ARR. He set the stage for a smooth and seamless transition in leadership for which I'm very grateful.
I'm going to cover a lot of ground today. So at the highest level, there are three key messages I'm hoping you take away from today's discussion. First, Dynatrace has established a solid foundation and we are continuing to fire on all cylinders. Second, Q3 was a very strong quarter, beating expectations across all key operating metrics and we are raising guidance for FY '22. And third, we're leaning further into our sales and marketing as well as R&D investments with the intention to drive accelerated growth.
Before talking about our financial performance and how I think about the future of the business, I thought it would be helpful to share with you my primary reasons for joining Dynatrace. First, the addressable market is enormous, over $50 billion and accelerating across all industries and we've only scratched the surface. Second, Dynatrace's technology is world-class and highly differentiated. Customers and analysts provided me with powerful third-party validation of the strength of Dynatrace and it's products and my recent customer conversations since taking the role have further reinforced this perspective. Third, Dynatrace's financial performance is exceptional and positions us in a very elite group of companies with similar results, with growth in excess of 30% and strong profitability, we are in excellent position to continue investing to deliver ever-increasing value to our customers. I enjoyed building market-leading multibillion-dollar businesses and this is precisely the opportunity we have in front of us at Dynatrace.
And finally, I joined Dynatrace because of the expertise and talent of our people. I admire the vibrancy of the Dynatrace culture, celebrating innovation, collaboration and customer orientation. In short, this is a company I'm thrilled to be a part of. And my passion and enthusiasm have only grown since starting in mid-December. I'm fired up and looking forward to this next phase of growth.
Moving on to our Q3 performance. Let me start by sharing how extremely pleased I am with the team's execution, once again beating guidance across all our key operating metrics. ARR finished at $930 million, up a very strong 32% year-over-year in constant currency. Subscription revenue was $226 million, up 34% year-over-year in constant currency. People often speak of the Rule of 40 as exemplifying strong performance in a highly successful SaaS business with the combination of ARR growth and free cash flow being greater than 40%.
On a trailing 12-month basis, we've been operating at a rule of nearly 60 with 32% ARR growth and 27% unlevered free cash flow margins and this remains the case for our FY '22 guidance. Our foundation for sustainable, long-term ARR growth continues to be the combination of adding new logos to the Dynatrace platform plus the ongoing expansion of existing customers. We continue to see strength in both areas. We have added more than 500 new logos to the Dynatrace platform over the past nine months which at 22% growth is above our historical 15% to 20% goal.
During the quarter, we continue to add industry leaders from diverse industries such as Varian Medical Systems, Janus Capital, the State of Arkansas and Wendy's. Of equal importance, we are closing larger initial transactions driven by multi-module sales, a key indicator of the value our customers are deriving from our observability platform. Year-to-date, our new logo ARR is up 37% over last year and 50% of these were three plus module sales.
As to existing customers, Secretario General de Administración, Marathon Petroleum and General Motors are a few examples of companies that expanded their Dynatrace investments, contributing to our net expansion rate being above 120% for the 15th consecutive quarter. The consistent execution against the two building blocks of new logo acquisition and net expansion rate has resulted in a sustained 30%-plus ARR growth business over the past couple of years which is a tremendous accomplishment. At the same time, we continue to see healthy bottom line performance in Q3 with 25% non-GAAP operating margins and non-GAAP EPS of $0.18 per diluted share, reflecting our commitment to running a balanced business even as we invest for future growth.
With the strength of our Q3 results and positive outlook ahead we are increasing our guidance for FY '22, as I mentioned which Kevin will provide more detail on shortly. Now I'd like to shift to how I think about our business moving forward. It would come as no surprise to any of you that digital transformation is at the heart of many global businesses today with IDC forecasting global spending in this area to exceed $10 trillion over a five year period. The result, if executed well, is an organization that is better suited to meet it's customers' needs, can compete more effectively in an online world and is equipped to do so more efficiently at lower cost. Digital transformation has become ubiquitous in driving corporate strategy from customer relationships to supply chain, to internal processes and beyond.
To execute digital transformation initiatives, organizations are often leveraging modern, ever-changing multi-cloud environments to deliver efficiency and flexibility but these environments also bring a scale and complexity that's well beyond that of the data center world. Teams need assistance in simplifying the overwhelming volume and complexity of data.
To innovate quickly, organizations need what we think of at Dynatrace as answer-driven automation, not just data but rather answers from the data that drive automated action. They want to optimize all aspects of their business at every moment in time, anywhere around the globe. And if there is an issue, they need to know it in real time before their customers or partners do. They need to be able to pinpoint the origin of the problem to enable rapid or even automatic resolution and they want to go further to gain insights and user experiences and use the wealth of information flowing through their systems to understand customer behavior and drive better business results such as increased conversions, higher revenue and profit optimization. This is the power of Dynatrace. Instead of requiring multiple disparate and disconnected tools and providing petabytes upon petabytes of data, Dynatrace provides a software intelligence platform that makes sense of it all, even in the most complex hybrid and multi-cloud environments. These modern environments demand more than serving up data on dashboards from manual analysis and action. Rather, we provide deep situational awareness to keep businesses operating and to radically improve innovation, efficiency and responsiveness.
Powered by our unique AIOps engine, unified with a deep and broad observability provided by the Dynatrace platform, we deliver the answers companies need to run their businesses most effectively and the automation to do it efficiently. In so doing, we have gone well beyond the capabilities of other in-house or competitive tools to become an indispensable part of our customers' cloud ecosystems.
Let me share a couple of examples of how the power of our platform translated into several strategic customer wins for Dynatrace during Q3. One of the largest insurance providers in the U.S. has a goal to digitally transform the insurance industry and make it easier for customers to buy their distribution teams to sell and their employees to work. In the midst of their transformation, they found the previous siloed multi-tool approach required far too much manual work and did not provide the answers to allow them to innovate at the speed and quality the business demanded.
With Dynatrace, they moved to a single source of truth and AI-driven answers. This freed time for innovation, accelerated their digital transformation and enabled them to optimize every step of their biggest client-facing application to ensure that their software performed precisely as internal and external customers expect. Another customer, a Fortune 500 global oil and gas company based in Asia is reshaping it's operations to ensure a sustainable future. Their previous monitoring tools and approaches were not designed for modern environments. The scale, speed of change and complexity of the multi-cloud architecture that is powering their transformation have surpassed these tools' ability to keep up. The customer came to Dynatrace to tame cloud complexity and provide end-to-end visibility and root cause analysis to reduce manual work.
By delivering intelligence and automation at enormous scale, we eliminated thousands of alerts in innumerable war rooms resulting in greater simplification, faster innovation and more efficient collaboration. As a result, Dynatrace has now become the blueprint for observability across the organization. These are just a couple of customer examples. I learn of more each day and with each successful engagement, it reinforces my enthusiasm for Dynatrace and the value we bring to our customers.
Near term, our focus will be on continued execution, leveraging what we're doing well and then finding ways to grow even faster. Consequently, we believe there is an opportunity to modestly increase investment in both sales and marketing as well as R&D to accelerate growth while maintaining healthy profitability which Kevin will say more about shortly. We've already made great strides in these areas with quota-carrying reps growing over 30% year-over-year, partners now influencing more than 50% of our transactions and brand awareness increasing.
The level of interest generated for our Perform conference next week is a great indicator of these efforts with more than 32,000 registered attendees expected, representing over 8,500 organizations, more than half new to Dynatrace. You can also expect that we'll continue to fuel our innovation engine with existing module expansion, new module creation and platform innovation to enable even more comprehensive views of our customer ecosystems. Our cloud application security module is a great example of our focus on continued innovation to produce substantial customer value as a fundamental element of our software intelligence platform. We're seeing positive early signs of traction and our differentiated approach is worth highlighting.
Back in December, as the world raced to protect systems from the Log4j vulnerability, our application security module was able to detect it within minutes of being published. Not only did we detect all instances of vulnerability across highly distributed multi-cloud environments but through our AI engine as well as our associated understanding of the topology and transaction patterns, we helped our customers prioritize application updates and mitigation strategies. Customers using alternative tools had to go through the painful and largely manual process of upgrading their agents and restarting their applications to mitigate Log4Shell.
One customer said, ""Other tools tell us we have a vulnerability but Dynatrace AppSec tells us everything about what, where and how to fix it."" Another customer told us, ""It's mind-blowing how Dynatrace Application Security found the Log4j vulnerability before any of our other numerous security products."" And yet another said, ""We've spent hundreds of hours trying to understand our exposure. And once Dynatrace AppSec was enabled, we immediately understood it.""
With this level of clear value-add to customers, it's no surprise that we saw an over 10x jump in POCs during this time. While we don't hope for more vulnerabilities, they have become an unfortunate and common reality. It is still early in Dynatrace's AppSec journey but I was delighted with the performance of the module as well as our customers' engagement and response. It offers a strong proof point of our unique offering and leads to our plan to drive ARR growth in this area in FY '23 and beyond. It is worth also noting my personal enthusiasm for our opportunity in this area, given my background in application security over the past decade.
Before I turn it over to Kevin, I am very pleased to welcome Ambika Kapur to the Dynatrace Board. Ambika has extensive product marketing knowledge and experience from her work at VMware, Bracket Computing and Cisco and her expertise in this area represents a valuable addition to the already strong breadth of knowledge and experience across this group.
In summary, I am delighted with our continued strong performance in Q3 and for the first three quarters of this fiscal year. We are putting our growth, profitability and cash generation to good use in our investments in innovation, go-to-market and the world-class talent needed to fuel future growth. I couldn't be more delighted to be part of Dynatrace and I look forward to meeting many of you in the future.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Kevin for more on our Q3 financials and our outlook for the fourth quarter. Kevin? Thank you, Rick and good morning, everyone. As Rick mentioned, we delivered another outstanding quarter on both the top and bottom line, setting us up for a solid finish to fiscal '22 with the building blocks in place for sustained ARR growth of 30% plus. Our investments in sales and commercial expansion continued to result in strong top line performance with ARR, revenue and subscription revenue exceeding our guidance and resulting in another increase in our annual guidance. ARR for the third quarter was $930 million. That's an increase of $66 million sequentially or $208 million year-over-year, representing 29% year-over-year growth. Sequentially, this includes a $15 million FX headwind.
On a year-over-year basis, this is a $21 million FX headwind of roughly 300 basis points. Given the fact that we focus on the needs of global enterprises, approximately half of our business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. This means that our ARR and financial results are subject to foreign currency fluctuation. Given the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, this is creating an ongoing headwind to our reported growth. As a result, we believe investors should focus on our constant currency growth rates as these reflect the true strength of the business.
On a constant currency basis, total ARR was $951 million, an increase of $229 million, representing 32% growth over the last year. Backing up the $34 million of perpetual license headwind to ARR which negatively impacted year-over-year growth rate by about 450 basis points, our constant currency adjusted ARR growth rate was 36% year-over-year. This represents the fourth quarter in a row with sustained growth rates above 35% and is reflective of the increased investments we have been making in our commercial organization. As we wind down the perpetual license revenue included in ARR, we believe the constant currency adjusted ARR growth reflects a sustained and durability growth rate of the business. Expanding on this further, when looking at ARR, excluding the impacts of the perpetual license headwind, we added $263 million of new ARR over the last 12 months compared to $176 million for the prior 12 months, an increase of nearly 50%. We included a quarterly historical chart of new ARR expansion, normalized for currency and perpetual runoff in our investor deck and data trends table that are available on our website.
As Rick mentioned, the building blocks for sustained ARR growth remain the same. The addition of new logos, combined with the ability to expand existing customer relationships as measured by our net expansion rate. New logo growth continues to be healthy. We added 206 new logos in the quarter, an increase of 9% over last year and year-to-date, we added 501 new logos, up 22% compared to the same period last year. Given the changes in seasonality of our business last year, where we had a much stronger back half due to the COVID headwinds in the first half, we believe a year-to-date view is the best way to look at new logo additions as it normalizes for these quarterly fluctuations.
As observability becomes a primary driver for new sales, we continue to see positive momentum with a higher percentage of customers landing with three or more modules. On a year-to-date basis, the number of new logos landing with three or more modules was 44% compared to 33% for the same period last year. In addition, over the last year, new logos have continued to land at a very healthy level with initial ARR lands of $116,000 on a trailing 12-month basis. Given the observability landing zone, we're starting to see a healthy increase in our average land size.
At this point, nearly half of our customers are now using three or more modules, demonstrating that Dynatrace's open and unified platform is an indispensable part of their ecosystem. With over 3,200 customers on the platform, that's an increase of more than 450 customers from a year ago, when about 1/3 of our customers use three or more modules. Average ARR for three plus module customers has increased to nearly $500,000, almost twice the size of the average ARR per Dynatrace customer at $287,000. Underlying this healthy average ARR for three plus module customers is the ARR contribution from our infrastructure module which increased over 75% from Q3 of last year.
Moving on to revenue. Total revenue for the third quarter was $241 million, up 33% year-over-year in constant currency and exceeding the high end of our guidance range by $6 million. Subscription revenue for the third quarter was $226 million, up 34% in constant currency, a $5 million beat versus the high end of our guidance. As I move forward in prepared remarks, I will be using non-GAAP measures, unless otherwise noted.
With respect to margins, gross margin for the third quarter was 85%, in line with last quarter and Q3 of last year. As we have said before, a very healthy margin reflecting the value and efficiency of the Dynatrace platform. Overall, we are extremely pleased with the strength of both our ARR growth and associated revenue performance. We believe that this further validates our strategy to continue to accelerate investments to grow the top line, as Rick discussed. You will continue to see us lean in on both commercial expansion and technology innovation to capture the large and growing market opportunity ahead of us.
For the third quarter, we invested $34 million in R&D, up 37% from last year. We continue to successfully attract and retain talent in our R&D organization, consistent with our expectations. On the go-to-market side, we invested $84 million in sales and marketing, up 45% over last year and within our current target investment zone of 34% to 36% of revenue. Our operating income for the third quarter was $61 million, $5 million above the high end of our guidance range, primarily due to the revenue upside that flowed through to the bottom line. This resulted in an operating margin of 25% compared to 29% in the third quarter of last year. Again, keep in mind that we saw significant savings last year related to the COVID shutdown and we began to reaccelerate investments starting in Q3 of last year. On the bottom line, net income was $52 million or $0.18 per share.
Turning to the balance sheet. As of December 31, we had $409 million of cash, an increase of $109 million compared to the same period last year. We are pleased with our continued healthy cash generation and believe it puts us in a strong position to consider strategic business investments where there's opportunity to accelerate growth in selected areas. Year-to-date, our unlevered free cash flow was $152 million, consistent with the same period last year. As a reminder, due to changes in billing patterns, we believe it's best to view unlevered free cash flow over time. On a trailing 12-month basis, our unlevered free cash flow was $238 million or 27% of revenue.
The last financial measure that I would like to discuss is our remaining performance obligation, RPO was approximately $1.4 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of 37% on a constant currency basis over Q3 of last year. The current portion of RPO which we expect to recognize as revenue over the next four quarters, was $804 million, an increase of 35% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. We are very pleased with the growth in RPO. However, we continue to believe ARR is the best metric to understand the business' performance as it removes variability associated with billings and contracting.
Moving on to guidance. As a reminder, when we talk about margins and profitability, I will be referring to non-GAAP measures. Since the end of Q3, the U.S. dollar has further strengthened, resulting in a growing Q4 FX headwind. To provide investors better visibility into the fundamental strength of our business, I'll share and recommend that investors focus on constant currency growth rates. Once again, we believe our investments in commercial expansion and product innovation will enable us to maintain 120% net expansion rate and 15% to 20% new logo growth over the midterm. These are the core building blocks that deliver sustained ARR growth of 30% plus over time.
With that in mind, we are once again raising our FY '22 ARR guidance to 30% to 31% growth year-over-year on a constant currency basis, up 100 basis points from our prior guidance. We expect as-reported ARR to be between $990 million and $996 million, up 28% to 29% year-over-year. In addition, our ARR guidance assumes roughly 300 basis points of headwind to ARR growth rates in fiscal '22 due to the associated perpetual license wind down. Therefore, we expect that our constant currency adjusted ARR growth will be 33% to 34%, again, an increase of 100 basis points from prior guidance. We are also raising our constant currency revenue guidance by 100 basis points for the year. We now expect total revenue to be between $922 million to $924 million, representing 31% year-over-year growth or 30% to 31% year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis.
Underlying that, we are also raising our subscription revenue guidance for the year by 150 basis points in constant currency. We now expect subscription revenue to be between $866 million and $867.5 million, up 32% year-over-year both as reported and in constant currency. We continue to expect subscription revenue to be 94% of total revenue, driven by the size and strength of ARR and associated subscription revenue growth.
Moving down the P&L. We expect full year operating income to be between $228 million and $230 million. As Rick mentioned earlier and consistent with our stated goals over the last year, we plan to lean in on investments to fuel additional ARR expansion and top line growth. However, it will take time to ramp additional investments before we further move the needle on ARR expansion. For the year, we expect sales and marketing to be in a range of 35% to 36% of revenue and R&D to be around 15% of revenue, resulting in an operating margin of nearly 25% of revenue.
As we plan beyond fiscal '22 and continue to lean in on our investments, we expect to layer in another 200 to 300 basis points between R&D and sales and marketing throughout fiscal '23. For the full year, we expect EPS of $0.66 to $0.67 per share, up $0.02 on the high end of our previous guidance. Our net income and EPS calculations assume an effective cash tax rate of 12%, consistent with prior guidance. At these investment levels, we are able to continue delivering strong unlevered free cash flow margins. We are raising unlevered free cash flow slightly to be $268 million to $275 million or approximately 29% to 30% of revenue for the year.
To summarize, our full year guidance is a continuation of our durable balance of growth and profitability, guiding to a Rule of 60 business when combining ARR growth and unlevered free cash flow margin. Looking at Q4, we expect total revenue to be between $245 million and $247 million, up 25% to 26% year-over-year or 27% to 28% in constant currency. In addition, subscription revenue is expected to be between $230.5 million and $232 million, up 26% to 27% year-over-year or 29% to 30% in constant currency. From a profit standpoint, operating income is expected to be between $51.5 million and $53.5 million, resulting in an operating margin of 21% to 22% of revenue as we continue to execute on our investment strategy, combined with the incremental spend related to our Perform conference next week. Finally, we expect EPS to be between $0.15 to $0.16 per share.
In summary, we are once again very pleased with the overall momentum of our third quarter performance with strong ARR and top line growth combined with healthy margins. As we have outlined, we have a solid foundation for sustained growth.
And with that, we will open the line for questions. Operator? [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question is from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Hey guys, good morning. Rick, welcome to Dynatrace. And we certainly look forward to working with you on an ongoing basis. So congrats on that, first and foremost. Guys, it seems like people are focused on the slight constant currency-adjusted ARR deceleration this quarter. But I think your new disclosures on the net new ARR growth was super helpful this quarter. And the way I look at it, if you exclude currency and the perpetual runoff, it looks like on a two year stack basis, you continue to accelerate ARR growth. Is that the right way to think about this? And I guess, overall, can you characterize the spending patterns for those that worry about maybe a slowdown in digital transformation spending post COVID? Sure, Matt, it's Kevin. So I think you're absolutely right. I think what we did provide in the top track and also in our supplement that we filed in our 8-K that's on our website is a disclosure about our new ARR expansion bookings. And what this is, is the growth in the business. And this year, on a trailing 12-month basis, we grew our ARR by $263 million which as we highlighted, was up 49% on a year-over-year basis. So that really is the underlying growth of our expansion bookings and we think that's a great indicator of the health of the business. I will also say it's important to look at our growth rate on a constant currency basis over the last four quarters, our ARR, excluding the perp license headwind, has been north of 35%. This quarter, it's dropped slightly 36% but super healthy.
Underlying the business, the demand environment remains very robust. The company continues to perform and we're hiring sales reps above plan. And we think the business is continuing to do extremely well. So between the combination of the 36% ARR-adjusted growth and the 49% ARR expansion bookings, we're super excited and pleased with the results in Q3. And thanks very much for the welcome, Matt. Appreciate it. Look forward to meeting you. Very excited both on the new logo front as well as net expansion rate, both look very strong and feel very good about the future. Thanks a lot, guys. Our next question is from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Yes, thanks. Hi guys and let me echo Matt's comments, Rick, welcome to Dynatrace. Just to further Matt's line of questions because, yes, that's what we're getting the most inbound interest from investors. On the ARR side, that slight -- or the 2% deceleration quarter-over-quarter, can you give us a sense of any thoughts that you might have around what your market share might have done in the quarter or pricing trends or anything else that may have also contributed to that two point slowdown? No significant changes, Sterling, in market share. We continue to have very healthy win rates across the board. So I think that continues. I'd say there is a slight change in seasonality. If you look at our ARR expansion in the first half of last year and certainly, on a year-to-date basis, it was impacted by COVID in the first half which made a little bit of an easier comp in Q2 of '22 compared to Q3 of '22. So fundamentally, win rates remain very healthy across the board. And as I mentioned earlier, the demand environment remains robust and people are continuing to accelerate their digital transformation initiatives and we think that bodes well for the future. Got it. Thank you. And what I would say, Sterling, is just that we continue to see the biggest opportunity as being a replacement of DIY. It is -- that is the biggest greenfield. And as Global 15,000 customers and companies move over to digital transformation initiatives, they just have a hodgepodge of tools that they need to replace with an integrated software intelligence platform and that's what we're focused on delivering to that category of companies. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Cikos with Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question. Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions here. I did want to circle back on some of the prepared remarks to make sure that I heard you properly but I thought that the comment was that you guys are looking to layer in additional investments when we think about fiscal '23, specifically in the sales and marketing and R&D. Could you remind us, I guess, where -- how those investments are expected to layer into those two functions as well as how long it takes a typical sales rep to ramp on Dynatrace? Sure. Let me take the first part of that. Our expectation and what we're seeing in the market is that there is upside opportunity for growth and that's what we're going to be investing in. So we're looking at a one to two point increase in R&D to drive innovation and additional product deployment in terms of new modules and module expansion and one to two point expansion during FY '23 in sales and marketing to drive awareness, new logo generation and overall penetration with partners. So those are the areas that we're going to be focused on driving in order to generate that growth incremental opportunity. And from a time to productivity, Mike, it's fairly consistent over the last couple of quarters. It's anywhere from four to five quarters for our sales reps to become productive. And we continue, as I mentioned earlier, a very solid, healthy clip of growing our sales reps. As you probably know, last year, we grew our sales organization direct quota capacity 25%. This year, our goal is 30%; we did better than that in Q3 here. And as Rick mentioned, we're going to put some more money into sales and marketing and one of the goals as well is to increase the number of direct sales reps as well across the board. Great, thank you. The next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Yes, thanks. Hey Rick, all the best from me as well. Just if you think about the investments that you're doing there and if I just do the math of four to five quarters here, like we cannot get an idea how we think about growth as well. But the question here is a little bit is like how do you think fundamentally about the growth for you guys. You kind of -- Kevin said that you see upside in the growth opportunity or upside in the growth in the market. Like can you just frame it in a more -- slightly more bigger picture of you've been a company that has been solidly growing in the mid-30s now for several quarters. Like how do you think this will evolve in the future against like a growing market opportunity? Let me take that. Thanks for the question. The starting point here, as we articulated in our prepared remarks, is really around digital transformation. That really is the fundamental and primary market driver that is growing this and especially growing the opportunity in the market in the Global 15,000, because that is creating enormous complexity of everything from on-prem to hybrid cloud, the multi-cloud environments that are untenable. And so that's where we start. And our linkage opportunity into these digital transformation projects is just enormous which is why one of the areas we're leaning into is through partnerships, hyperscalers and others because they're now generating a substantial percentage of new logo opportunity for us; so that's the beginning. And then what we need to do is we need to provide an integrated software intelligence platform that provides situational awareness to allow for the monitoring and the observability of an entire infrastructure, not reactively but proactively to provide essentially answers to the questions that customers are asking about managing those infrastructures going forward and automatic resolution. So these are the kinds of areas in which we're investing to drive our opportunity into the future. Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ruykhaver with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Yes. Good morning, everyone. So Rick, I think this is more for you. When you look at the sales motion, I'm curious to hear your view on developer engagement versus being focused on targeting C-level suite, particularly given the success some of your competitors are showing with a more bottoms-up approach. Great question. We are absolutely shifting less as the terminology goes into earlier in the development cycle. So this is going to be a key aspect of our development opportunities and our marketing and sales opportunities as we look to the future. Not only are we doing elements and providing capabilities like code validation but integrating through APIs which -- or announcements that you'll see to come directly into code bases to provide for an allowance of observability metrics to be integrated directly at the code level. So this is -- it is a great question and it is directly consistent with where we're headed in the future in terms of the shift left motion back into the development process. Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. The next question is from the line of Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Okay, thanks and good morning. Rick, I just wanted to double click and take a step back on the increased investment notion. First, could you just maybe just take us through the process that you went through in determining the need for the further investment? I understand you run a very efficient R&D organization but already fairly healthy levels for sales and marketing spend. So the process that you went through in determining that? And secondly, the framework that you thought about for earning a return on those investments. I imagine a lot of it's related to growth, if you could maybe double click on the specific areas of growth that you're thinking about for payoff, that would be helpful. Great question. So on the R&D front, to take that one, we run a very efficient R&D organization primarily out of Europe. It is incredible how much they deliver. But we believe that the market is ripe for further expansion in terms of both our existing modules and deployment as well as new opportunities. For example, look at what we've been talking about with the AppSec module. We believe that we've hit a huge nerve in vulnerability analytics that provides us with immense capability to target a latent need that has only just begun. We're at the very, very early stages of AppSec ARR and yet we think that, that has dramatic opportunity for growth into next year. So that's one example of where we're investing in development, logging associated with infrastructure and the infrastructure growth that we see of that module is also another area, substantial investment in the R&D side. Those have corollary investments, obviously, that need to happen in the sales and marketing side to grow our opportunity in infrastructure, grow our opportunity in AppSec and grow awareness in the market about the brand overall. And we're seeing this opportunity. It manifests itself through our customers and customer spend in terms of things like multi-module deployment and in terms of growth in the ARR per customer for those multi-module deployments. So this is -- that's the analysis that we went through to evaluate that now is the time and the new modules provide the fuel for us to be able to go after that additional wallet share. Very helpful. Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Thank you very much and congratulations on your position. Curious to get at a high level, any changes in the strategic direction for the company? Secondly, on a more tactical level, were you able to discern any changes in product contribution from the different silos? And any update on the competitive environment would also be very useful. Sure. So in terms of overall strategic direction, as we've said several times, this is a company that is, we believe, firing on all cylinders. So nothing is -- in coming in, john did an amazing job of building the company to the point that we're at today. And so I am of great fortune in joining a company that is operating and performing exceptionally well. That is a great foundation. So no major changes in strategy, certainly in the first six or seven weeks here for me. What I would say and as we've indicated in the call, we believe that there's an opportunity to lean in further especially with some of the new modules and new capabilities that we have in infrastructure as well as AppSec, for example. So those are our areas, both on the development side and on the sales and marketing side that we'll lean into.
The other aspect that I would indicate is just on the partner front. As I've alluded to, partner opportunities are substantial. And in my view, to create acceleration over the course of FY '23, it has to be, to some extent, the power of the and, as I've heard in the past many times. It is not just the expansion at the 30% level of the number of reps we have and going after the market in the same way that we've done so in the past but also then expanding that opportunity to include partners to be able to canvass the market more completely. So those are some of the areas that we'll look at.
One other area that, obviously, we can't comment on in any detail. But I owned M&A for the last 10 years at Akamai and that was a tool that I used pretty extensively. So we're going to be active shoppers and very disciplined buyers, only leaning in where we see it appropriate but that's another tool that we have in our arsenal that we'll begin to look at as well, things like the SpectX acquisition that we did to focus on continuous analytics at enormous scale. These are elements that we can integrate directly into our platform to drive further scale and growth. That's great. And just a quick follow up. If all these initiatives were to bear fruit, are we making too much of the sequential deceleration that everybody is pointing out? And if these initiatives bear fruit, could we see reacceleration in the business because you are definitely investing for growth, as you said, the research development and the partnership and the sales and marketing side? Kash, it's Kevin. Yes. As Rick said, we are firing on all cylinders. And these incremental investments are all focused on accelerating ARR growth over the midterm and longer term. It will take a few quarters for that to obviously kick into that ARR top line. But the market opportunity is tremendous ahead of us. Our platform is amazing. We have some great modules that we're bringing to market here in the next 12 months as well. And I think all those combined gets us pretty excited about that top line ARR growth number accelerating over the longer term. Wonderful. Thank you so much and congratulations. Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Kamil Mielczarek with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So, I just want to follow-up on the comment that I think Rick made on M&A. Can you just maybe talk a little bit more about the framework behind your decision to acquire versus build new products? And given Dynatrace is now in a net cash position and we're seeing digitization drive the secular tailwind for likely multi-years, would you consider something more transformative? Well, look, we're not going to comment on specific acquisitions and opportunities. But I would say -- and it's a great question, I figured I was going to prompt a follow-up question out of that set of remarks and I do appreciate the question. We're going to be opportunistic, looking and scanning the market for M&A really across the gamut. And certainly, I'm not going to commit to a transformational M&A or anything of that nature. What I will say is we'll be looking at M&A as an accelerant to grow. And that's -- that was really my earlier comment and we'll look at it at all shapes and sizes in evaluating it but we're going to be very, very disciplined in our acquisition strategy as we look at it. Great. And just a quick follow up for Kevin. Can you maybe update us on how customer count growth came in relative to your expectations? And how should we think about the single product customer churn over the next few quarters? Yes. So it's playing out as we had anticipated and as we communicated on our Q4 call. I think, as a reminder, we had -- for folks, we had about 200 customers that were single module sort of non-platform legacy customers that we do believe were going to churn over the next four to six quarters. We've churned about half of them so far. And I think over the next three to four quarters, we'll see the churn of the balance of those probably another 100 or so over the next three to four quarters-ish [ph]. That's great. Thanks, again. Our next question is from the line of Fatima Boolani with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. And Rick, welcome to the team. I look forward to working with you. Maybe I'll start with you, you've set a tremendous pedigree in the security arena and you spent a lot of time talking about how big the application security franchise could be for Dynatrace. I'm curious in the reinvestment envelope that you set out for fiscal '23, can you talk to us a little bit about maybe the opportunities and challenges with selling to a much more different buyer in the security realm in sort of how we should think about that manifesting in your sales and marketing expenses and posture? And then I have a quick follow-up for Kevin. Okay, sure. In terms of the buyers, the good news is I think there's a ton of leverage in the buyer that we have today. In fact, we're -- with the Log4j situation that occurred back in December evolved, obviously, those discussions happen very rapidly in order to get our AppSec module deployed into POCs. And that, of course, wasn't a new buying process. That was through our existing buyers who had a very strong need to resolve the Log4j situation very rapidly. So the good news is there's a lot of overlap. Now as we move into AppSec even more deeply, clearly, the buyer will morph a little bit but we think that there is, as I say, enormous leverage there. In terms of the broader question on AppSec, yes, I think that this is an enormous growth opportunity for the company. I think it is very natural and logical for customers to be looking at managing their overall ecosystems and environments and wanting simultaneously to make sure that it's protected. And so the value proposition is extraordinary. And I think it is a very consistent story for our customers to expand in this sector. Kevin, historically or certainly in the last couple of quarters, we've certainly had some conversations about the buying and procurement behavior of ""economically sensitive industries."" I'm curious, as you look at your pipeline just from a vertical perspective, where are we in terms of business momentum in buying posture in some of these economically sensitive industries that you've called out historically? And frankly, are we sort of back to pre-pandemic levels of engagement and purchasing activity? Any updates there would be very helpful. Sure. Fatima, what I think the punchline is we are seeing strength across all of the different verticals. So certainly, obviously, during the COVID era, we're getting some headwinds in COVID-related industries. But every company now is embarking or have embarked on new transformation initiatives. It's critical to their success going forward, so we're seeing strength across the board in all different verticals. Rick, anything to add on that? I certainly think that some of those protected verticals are going to be important areas and avenues of evolution. Digital transformation isn't resigned to be just in one or two verticals. It's obviously enormous in areas like banking and commerce, manufacturing, health care, where we see it driven foremost. But the federal government, for example, in light of others are all areas in which digital transformation is occurring and in which we have an opportunity for growth. Thank you. The next question comes from the line of DJ Hynes from Canaccord. Please proceed with your question. Hey, good morning guys. Rick, I want to ask a high-level question of you. So as you did your diligence on Dynatrace and have gotten to know the business better over the last 1.5 months or so, what was the KPI that stood out to you where you said, man, this is really best-in-class, we can get a lot of leverage out of this. And then conversely and probably more interestingly to this crowd, what was the KPI where you thought, this is okay but we can probably do better? That's a great question. I started with the financial performance, actually, because financial performance at nearly a Rule of 60 is phenomenal. And so when I got a call to consider being a CEO of a company that was operating at a Rule of 60, had for a bit of time and looked like it was going to continue that into the future and had further opportunity for acceleration, I was all in and very, very excited to be in the seat now. So thrilled with the selection of our Board to give me the opportunity to go drive it, so that was that. In terms of KPIs that have surprised me on the downside, I would say none really. I would probably pivot the answer to the question to instead say, where can we lean in? And I think the areas where we can lean in are the areas that we've been discussing like, for example, new modules and multi-module sales, I think, can be even bigger where Dynatrace really shines for our customers is when you do full deployment of the entire software intelligence platform.
And so we've got an opportunity for further penetration into both our installed base as well as new customers with these multi-module sales deployment. We're going to continue to add new modules, new capabilities and everywhere from infrastructure to AppSec as we've been discussing. So those are areas we're leaning in. I also think that we have an opportunity to lean in on the sales and marketing side as we've been discussing. So I won't belabor it other than to say that I think that there's substantial opportunity with hyperscaler expansion, global system integrators and other partners around the world in order to further accelerate.
So I view it as it's all good; no surprises on the downside and lots of opportunity for us to execute against on the upside. Yes. Okay, great. That's good to hear. Thanks. Our next question is from the line of Gray Powell with BTIG. Please proceed with your question. Great, thanks. I really appreciate that. So yes, I know you've received a lot of questions on the operating margin side but I just had a couple of follow-ups, if that's okay. So yes, Dynatrace has always delivered just a really compelling balance of high growth and strong margins. You just talked about how the Rule of 60 was why -- one of the reasons you thought was really compelling to join Dynatrace. So I'd just be curious, Rick, what do you think the right margin level is going forward such that you don't miss out on any potential growth opportunities? Well, great, great question. I think we'll tune it over time. But at least in our initial assessment, you sort of heard the focus around profitable growth. And we're very much committed to maintaining this profitable growth approach. We believe that leaning in to the tune of, as I said, one to two points on the R&D side, one to two points in sales and marketing is the correct initial land to go after this opportunity, given the growth in the business at top line north of 30%. That obviously fuels a lot of incremental OpEx in and of itself as you're growing headcount and growing opportunity for spend in other areas. So it's really the combination of those factors that we're leaning into. We'll continue to reassess this as we go through time. But that certainly gives us the power that we believe make the investments needed to be successful in driving this incremental growth. Got it. Thanks. Our next question is from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Please proceed with your question. Hi, thank you. For you, Kevin, I wanted to ask a clarification and a question. The clarification first. When you talk about the incremental investments, is that an FY over FY or is that a Q4 run rate when we think about our FY? And if you could also clarify, is there a similar impact that we should be thinking about to the free cash flow margins? Or is there some offsets on working capital? The question I had, Kevin, also is for you. I just wanted to review the growth algorithm as we think about '23 -- FY '23 for you. And coming off your Analyst Day, we think about kind of 120 plus on the net retention rate and 15 to 20 new customer logo adds. Is that still the right kind of algorithm? And what I'd particularly like to hear you comment in, because I think there is broad investor concern, is there anything changed as you approach the new fiscal year on win rates and/or net retention rate? And if you could also just comment on anything specific on how you think the security offering that you have may be contributing in the new fiscal year in terms of that growth algorithm. Okay. Yes, a couple of different questions there, Keith. So from an OpEx standpoint, Rick sort of outlined one or two basis points in both R&D and sales and marketing. And we're going to step into these investments over the next couple of quarters. It's not something that we just turn the spigot on and we can increase hiring overnight. So you will see the margin impact over the next couple of quarters throughout fiscal '23. And bringing that down to free to cash flow, again, not trying to provide guidance on this call at this point. But certainly, that will reduce cash flow by a couple of hundred basis points. However, our cash has also been negatively impacted by the perpetual license runoff over the last couple of years. So that can be an offset as well. So we're not thinking as big of an impact on the unlevered free cash flow side as compared to the operating income side. Hopefully, that was helpful.
And then when I think about the building blocks for FY '23, you're absolutely right, 120% net expansion and 15% to 20% new logo growth. And if you do the math on that, just on sort of those base numbers, 120% net expansion adds about $200 million of ARR next year. If you do new logo growth and you grow 20% and your average land is $100,000, $125,000, that's another $80 million-ish of ARR. So between those two sort of core building blocks, we're growing the business by $280 million. Again, not trying to provide guidance on the call. And I sort of think of those as the base numbers. Obviously, if you look at our net expansion rate, right now, it's impacted by the perpetual license headwind and that will start -- has started to wind down as well. So we have a pretty healthy net expansion rate, nicely above that 120% rate.
So hopefully that was helpful, Keith, in terms of how we think about just the core basic building blocks of the business next year. They haven't changed. And I think as Rick outlined we're putting some other programs in place that we think can boost and accelerate the business as well. I'll wrap it up. Any specific comments on security? I know I'm at the end of the lineup, so I apologize if I ask one more question but any comments on security? Security, I would say, is very early, as I said but an area in which we're leaning into. We'll be driving it aggressively and you'll hear more. The good news is Log4j is a great example of vulnerability analytics and how critical it is to the market. And as we said in our prepared remarks, we've increased by 10x in one month, really from December to January, the number of POCs that we're driving there, that we are now evaluating our customers, are evaluating and going through that process. So early days but excited about the opportunity for growth and very committed to AppSec leadership over time. Thank you. Thank you. Our last question is coming from the line of Koji Ikeda with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Great guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here. So a question for Rick. You've been there for a couple of months now; you saw some big deal expansion. I mean, the business is operating in a big TAM. Business is investing in sales and technology, APM observability is super important for organizations of all sizes out there and then thinking about the legacy runoff, too. The question is, how do you think about the potential with the commentary on NRR? It goes up to 125% plus or maybe even better, up from the 120% plus the company has been delivering so consistently for such a long time now. Well, NER is a huge metric for us. And the fact that we've delivered it now for 15 straight quarters at north of 120%, I think, is demonstrable of just the power of the platform that our customers see and the fact that they are leaning in aggressively to things like multi-module deployments, increased host units, full stack spend, infrastructure and new modules. All of these elements are driving that NER northward in terms of the installed base of existing customers. And then once we deploy new customers, the other good piece of news is that those new customers are increasingly likely to deploy multiple modules as well. So we're seeing the power of the platform really across the board. It is certainly my expectation as we add more module capabilities in the existing modules plus new modules such as AppSec that we're going to see even further expansion of multi-module deployment and further increases in spend. So I believe that there's an opportunity to have some accretion in NER as we look forward. But still early in that regard. In the meantime, we look to continue to operate the business in north of 120% in NER as we look at it. Thank you. So all, thanks very much for joining for my first call as CEO. I really appreciate it. The summary message, I guess, I would leave with you coming out of the call is as follows: number one, we are a company firing on all cylinders. To some of the questions and remarks that came through the Q&A session, that's why I'm here and that's why I'm excited about it. I do think that there is an opportunity for accelerating growth which is why we're leaning in here even more aggressively in some of the areas like R&D and sales and marketing. And so those are opportunities for further expansion as we look to the future and that's why we increased the guide for the fiscal year. So we're leaned in. Also super excited about our Perform conference to come next week where we've got over 30,000 expected registrants. And so that's another area where we look forward to seeing some of you on that session as well.
So, thank you all very much for participating in our call. And as I said at the outset, I look forward to meeting many of you in the future. Thanks very much. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.","a question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation . at this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode . a detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP measures can be found on our website .",0.0

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today's conference is being recorded.
At this time, I'll turn the conference over to Noelle Faris, Vice President of Investor Relations. Noelle, you may begin. Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Dynatrace's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 earnings conference call. With me on the call today are Rick McConnell, Chief Executive Officer; and Kevin Burns, Chief Financial Officer.

And with that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Rick McConnell. Rick? Thanks, Noelle, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's call. I'd like to begin by thanking the 3,600-plus people of Dynatrace for their immense contributions in helping us to achieve several notable milestones in fiscal 2022. In particular, we continue to deliver very strong growth in adjusted ARR of 35% for the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year, marking the second straight year of mid-30s growth for Dynatrace.
Additionally, in the fourth quarter, we surpassed the $1 billion threshold in annualized revenue. This is a significant achievement while operating at a rule of 60 when combining adjusted ARR growth and free cash flow margin. It is a testament to the strength of our market, our platform, and the durability of our business model, which, in combination, enable us to run a business that delivers high growth with strong profitability and free cash flow.
Let me share a few financial highlights from the fourth quarter. ARR ended the fiscal year at $995 million. Subscription revenue was $235 million, an increase of 31% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating income was $58 million or 23% of revenue. These strong results were driven by the combination of solid new logo additions to the Dynatrace platform in addition to the expansion of existing customers.
We grew our new logo additions by 18% year-over-year for Q4 and 21% for the full year, above the high end of 15% to 20% annual growth. And our net expansion rate was at or above 120% for the 16th straight quarter. I'd like to devote the rest of my remarks to how we drive our continued success in fiscal 2023 and beyond, specifically covering market opportunity, product leadership and go-to-market leverage.
Let me start with the market. We have sized our market opportunity at $50 billion in growing. Digital transformation has become ubiquitous and our market for observability and application security solutions has become an essential element of successful transformations. According to IDC's 2022 Worldwide CEO Survey, driving digital transformation is the number one business priority for CEOs in 2022.
To execute these digital transformation initiatives, organizations are accelerating their movement to the cloud. But what many companies are realizing is that as they scale the dynamic nature of modern files introduces incredible complexity, the larger the business, the more complex their cloud ecosystem.
Global 15,000 companies are running multi-cloud and hybrid cloud environments with thousands of applications, many of which leverage microservices and containers. This frequently yields a complicated ecosystem, often generating petabytes of data and tens of millions of interdependencies.
Companies are often overwhelmed and ill-equipped to handle this level of complexity. The majority of observability solutions deployed have been assembled internally, pulling in multiple disparate tools to gain visibility into their ecosystems. But the end result is even more non-cohesive data for teams to process. And when there is an issue, these tools don't provide sufficient clarity to enable rapid resolution.
Companies are looking to simplify this complexity with comprehensive observability, incorporating all forms of data across multiple aspects of their technology stack. They want more than just dashboards. They want answers and intelligent automation from their data along with remediation capabilities to enable them to operate more efficiently.
This brings me to my second topic, the strength and differentiation of the Dynatrace platform and why enterprise customers choose Dynatrace. Overall, we are investing significantly in R&D to ensure that we expand customer value and deliver significant differentiation. Nearly 1/3 of our workforce is driving our innovation engine to extend the depth and breadth of our platform.
What the Dynatrace platform delivers uniquely is end-to-end observability, leveraging our AIOps engine to invoke situational awareness and true causation versus just correlation across complex ecosystems. We deliver our platform across multiple modules.
First is our industry-leading solution for apps and microservices, which delivers best-in-class observability across the full stack, including infrastructure and applications. Closely aligned to our full stack module is our digital experience management or DEM module, which optimizes user experience across channels and extends our platform value to digital business owners.
Next is infrastructure monitor, which provides server, log, network and container observability. It is our fastest-growing module now in excess of $100 million in ARR and deployed by more than 50% of our customers. Our application security module has sparked significant interest in the market by helping companies manage vulnerabilities such as Log4Shell.
In fourth quarter, the number of customers using our AppSec module more than doubled. Our Cloud Automation module enables customers to perform automated quality and security validation for safer deployments. Also during Q4, we announced the ability of customers to shift left by accessing a huge array of the answers delivered by our platform as code and easily incorporate software intelligence capabilities into their applications.
And there is so much more to come with our platform. One in particular that we expect to release in the second half of this year is dramatically enhanced logging capabilities. Our vision is to provide a fully automated, highly performance and cost-effective log monitoring solution that scales with the largest businesses. We believe this market is ripe for disruption. Unlike current logging tools, we do not view logs as siloed, but rather a key data source to analyzing the full context of observability and security, leveraging intelligent automation capabilities of a full Dynatrace block.
Our customers expand their usage in two dimensions, both with the number of modules deployed as well as the number and scale of the workloads run. Both dimensions provide visibility to immense volumes of data, and more data leads to more complexity, making manual a learning and response nearly antenna.
But to Dynatrace, more data facilitates more sophisticated and improved AI analytics by processing all data sources while reducing the time it takes to get precise answers that ensure well-functioning software. The average ARR for customers using three or more modules is nearly $500,000 and that level continues to increase. Today, nearly half of our customers are multi-module.
A British multinational telecommunication company had over 60 disparate systems deployed for observability, including those from our competitors. In Q4, they agreed to expand their existing relationship with an eight-figure transaction covering the entire breadth of the Dynatrace platform, an enormous deal and testament to the power of Dynatrace.
Another example of the value of Dynatrace is a multinational consumer electronics retailer that consolidated a wide array of technologies by leveraging our software intelligence platform. They had over 30 disparate tools, collecting data across their ecosystem. The need for one solution that could expand the entire ecosystem, unify the data and provide intelligence was evident when an issue arose causing end user disruptions that were undetectable by any of their existing tools. Dynatrace was selected to provide visibility and precise answers.
In Application Security, a large U.K. gaming company has started a POC just days before Log4Shell came to light and quickly converted just three weeks later due to the value of the platform in detecting all instances of the vulnerability, understanding the transaction patterns and prioritizing application updates. This brings me to our go-to-market strategy.
Given the powerful trends and market opportunity I touched on earlier, commercial expansion continues to be a top priority for us. We've made great progress across three strategic go-to-market areas, including the expansion of our direct sales force, amplifying our partnerships and bolstering our brand.
With our direct sales force, we successfully increased our quota-carrying sales reps by nearly 30% over the last 12 months, providing us with increased coverage for the Global 15,000 market that we target. And our goal is to drive the same level of growth in reps in fiscal '23.
In late April, we had our annual sales kickoff with the entire global sales team. This was our first in-person kickoff since 2019, so you can imagine how energizing and engaging the event was for all of us. These events are to foster relationships, educate our sales force, and build upon our already successful and efficient go-to-market momentum. Adding to this momentum, we are heavily focused on the expansion of our partner ecosystem.
To start, the three hyperscalers, AWS, Azure and GCP, offer greater leverage through deeper integrations, sales force engagement, and offerings in their respective marketplaces. New ARR transacted through hyperscalers, again, more than tripled during the quarter versus last year. The general availability of our platform last quarter running natively as SaaS with Azure and GCP, with AWS already available, represents another significant catalyst for us this year.
I'm especially excited about our developing relationships with global system integrators. Today, Deloitte announced that they have chosen Dynatrace as their solution for their cloud observability practice. Their deep industry-specific knowledge and modern delivery expertise, coupled with our multi-cloud observability and advanced AIOps capabilities, is a powerful combination for Global 15,000 companies. The combined offering will focus on optimizing cloud ecosystems.
I'll wrap up our go-to-market strategy with brand. Market and brand awareness continue to be important components of our go-to-market efforts. As you may have seen, we have begun to build out our branding and marketing efforts with an awareness campaign combined with increased targeting in search engine optimization.
We want companies beginning or in the midst of digital transformation efforts to think of Dynatrace as cloud ecosystems done right. When they are ready to increase cloud workloads, we want to be part of the initial deployment decision, thereby shrinking the gap between cloud ecosystem migration and deployment of world-class observability.
Finally, as most of you have seen, Kevin has decided to depart Dynatrace as of the end of this calendar year. During this period, we will be searching for an equally strong successor CFO for the Company. Kevin's contribution to Dynatrace over the past six years has been immense from overseeing one of the fastest moves to a high-growth recurring revenue business to our successful IPO in 2019. I'd like to thank Kevin for his strong dedication to Dynatrace, and I appreciate his commitment to a seamless transition.
To close, we believe that our observability platform is highly differentiated and well positioned in a large and rapidly growing market. We are innovating at a rapid rate and we are building up go-to-market leverage through increased sales capacity as well as partners. Fiscal 2022 was an extraordinary year for the Company as we drove record levels of ARR and revenue with excellent operating margins and cash flow. We remain committed to ongoing strong financial performance and are deeply passionate about the opportunity ahead.
With that, I will turn it over to Kevin to cover the financials and detailed guidance. Kevin? Good morning, everyone, and thank you, Rick. I appreciate the kind words. Before I get into the financials, I want to thank the entire Dynatrace team for giving me this incredible opportunity to be CFO of this amazing company. Together, we have built a world-class team and organization that is still early in its growth trajectory. I look forward to working with Rick to onboard a new CFO, ensuring a successful transition and then taking a break to enjoy time with my family.
As Rick mentioned, Q4 was a fantastic quarter, capping off a strong finish to fiscal '22. ARR is a key performance metric of the overall strength of the business, and we delivered 35% adjusted ARR growth for the second year in a row, exceeding the high end of our guidance range by one percentage point, highlighting the resiliency and predictability of our business model. Please keep in mind, adjusted ARR growth normalizes for currency and the wind down of perpetual license ARR, a reconciliation can be found on our IR website.
Total ARR was up $221 million year-over-year, ending the fiscal year at $995 million. Reported ARR would have been $10 million higher and well above the high end of our guidance range when you take into account two items. First, we suspended business in Russia, resulting in a nearly $6 million reduction in ARR. And secondly, we had another $4 million of incremental currency headwinds as the U.S. dollar strengthened yet again in recent months.
As we have communicated for the last few years, the building blocks for ARR growth continue to be the combination of our net expansion rate and the addition of new logos. Our net expansion rate for the fourth quarter was above 120% which is now four years in a row. We continue to see momentum in new logo additions. We added 205 new logos in the fourth quarter. That's up 18% over last year.
In total, we added 706 new logos this year, that's 21% growth and above our previously communicated expectations of 15% to 20%. Our average ARR per customer with three or more modules continues to increase. This cohort represented nearly half of our customers in the fourth quarter. These customers have an average ARR of nearly $500,000. Given the significant cross-sell and expansion opportunities in our customer base, we continue to believe that the average ARR per customer could be $1 million or more.
Moving on to revenue, total revenue for the fourth quarter was $253 million, $6 million above the high end of our guidance. Total revenue and subscription revenue both grew 31% over last year. With respect to margins, total non-GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter was 84%, down one percentage point, driven by a slight change in revenue mix and increased investments in customer success. We expect gross margins to remain roughly consistent in fiscal '23.
Our non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter was $58 million, $4 million above the high end of our guidance range, driven by the revenue upside in the quarter. This resulted in a non-GAAP operating margin of 23%, exceeding our guidance range by roughly 100 basis points. Non-GAAP net income was $48 million or $0.17 per share, $0.01 above the high end of our guidance.
Turning to a quick summary of the financial results for the full year. Total revenue was $929 million and subscription revenue was $870 million, both of which grew 32% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating income for the year was $234 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 25%. Non-GAAP net income for the year was $198 million or $0.68 per share.
As we've mentioned in the past, we believe in a balanced approach to operating the business, one that delivers strong and durable performance on both the top line and bottom line. This approach proves to be even more important as we navigate the rapidly evolving macro environment, where the resiliency and predictability of our business model is the parent.
Turning to the balance sheet, as of March 31, we had $463 million of cash, and our net cash position was $189 million. Our unlevered free cash flow for Q4 was very solid at $82 million. For the full year, our unlevered free cash flow was $234 million or 25% of revenue. This came in below our guidance range due to a tax refund that was due in fiscal '22, but not received until the start of fiscal '23.
Given the strength of our cash flow and the declining interest expense as we've reduced our long-term debt consistently, this quarter will be the last quarter we provide unlevered free cash flow and are moving to free cash flow as a metric.
The last financial measure that I would like to discuss this morning is our remaining performance obligation, which at the end of the quarter was approximately $1.6 billion, an increase of 33% over Q4 of last year. The current portion of RPO, which we expect to recognize as revenue over the next four quarters, was approximately $900 million, an increase of 34% year-over-year.
Now let me turn to guidance. We are very pleased with how the business has performed in recent years, and we anticipate delivering another strong performance in fiscal '23. We believe we have the right foundation in place to sustain 15% to 20% growth in new logos and a net expansion rate of 120% or higher for fiscal '23.
There are a few things to keep in mind with respect to our guidance. First, we are mindful of the evolving macro environment. To be clear, we have not seen any material impact to our business, and we are confident in the durability and predictability of our growth. However, we believe it makes sense to be prudent with guidance. Second, with almost half of our business conducted in foreign currency, the continued strength of the U.S. dollar creates a sizable currency headwind.
Based on FX rates as of April 30, we expect the FX headwind to ARR and revenue to be roughly $20 million for fiscal '23. And with respect to Q1, we anticipate the FX headwind to be roughly $15 million to ARR. As you think about your models over the course of the year, keep in mind that every 1% movement in non-USD currency equates to roughly $6 million of movement in ARR.
Third, we announced that we suspended business in Russia, which results in a headwind of approximately $6 million on ARR and revenue for fiscal '23. And finally, fiscal '23 will be the final year where the perpetual license wind down will have a significant impact on ARR growth rates. The overall annual impact in fiscal '23 is approximately $8 million or 80 basis points. The impact will be most notable in Q1 with a three percentage point headwind and then tapering off throughout the year.
Starting with our guidance for the full year, again, with growth rates in constant currency, we expect ARR to be between $1.25 billion and $1.265 billion representing an adjusted ARR growth of 29% to 30%. This assumes net new ARR growth of $290 million at the high end of guidance, offset by the $20 million headwind that I just mentioned.
Given the FX impact in Q1, we wanted to provide you with a little bit more color on Q1 seasonality. Historically, roughly 18% of our annual net new ARR is closed in Q1, which would imply $52 million of net new ARR in constant currency in Q1. As I just said, there is also a $15 million currency headwind on our fiscal '22 year number that needs to be taken into account in Q1.
Total revenue for the full year is expected to be $1.142 billion to $1.158 billion. Underlying that, subscription revenue is expected to be between $1.071 billion and $1.086 billion, both up 27% to 28% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be between $257 million and $266 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 22.5% to 23% for the year.
We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.74 to $0.77 per share based on 292 million to 294 million diluted shares outstanding and a non-GAAP cash tax rate of 13%. We expect free cash flow margin to be approximately 29% to 30% of revenue, which equates to $330 million to $345 million. This is 45% growth year-over-year at the midpoint and incorporates the impact from the timing of the tax refund I mentioned earlier.
Looking at Q1, we expect total revenue to be between $261 million and $263.5 million or 29% to 31% growth. Subscription revenue is expected to be between $244 million and $246.5 million, up 29% to 30% year-over-year. From a profit standpoint, non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $60 million and $62 million, 23% to 23.5% of revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $0.17 to $0.18 per share based on the share count of 291 million to 292 million diluted shares.
In summary, we are very pleased with our fourth quarter and fiscal '22 performance where we saw strong ARR and top line growth combined with healthy cash margins. We have achieved the important milestone of $1 billion in annualized revenue and continue to operate at Rule of 60. Dynatrace's breadth of product offerings and our geographic reach provides us with multiple growth opportunities in the future. Overall, we believe we are well positioned for resilient and predictable growth profitability and cash flow in fiscal '23 and beyond.
And with that, we'll open the line for questions. Operator? Thank you. At this time, we will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Rick, I wanted to start with you just with respect to some of your comments in the prepared remarks around the broader secular opportunity and still what is a vastly underpenetrated state for observability solutions given those broader trends. But I know there's been a lot of hanging in the investor community around these, business and pricing, models rather than are consumption and usage based. So I'm curious if you can just sort of give us a quick overview on how your model with one agent is differentiated; and cloud usage and consumption trends that are perhaps impacting some of -- might not necessarily sort of come your way? And I have a quick follow-up for Kevin, please. Thanks very much for the question. So first of all, completely agree with you in terms of the secular trends and the opportunity and insurability. We believe, as I mentioned in my remarks, that it's quite substantial. In terms of consumption, I do think that we'll see more consumption-based pricing over time. And I do think that there is accretion opportunity in pricing as we look ahead just amidst the overall market environment. We do have built-in price increases in our typical support contracts at the time of renewal. So, we see accretion opportunity as we look at it. And Kevin, just for you, with respect to the new logo performance in the quarter, I know Rick talked about sort of elevating or expanding the sales capacity by 30% in the trailing 12-month period. But I'm wondering when and where we're going to see a more meaningful or visible acceleration on the new logo front? And that's it for me. So when we think about the building blocks for next year, the base model that we have right now is 15% to 20% new logo growth, which is what we've been doing consistent the last couple of years. I do agree with you how we're giving some of the investments that we're making and accelerating in terms of the direct sales force, the investments that we're making in the hyperscalers and partners in SI.
There could be some further tailwinds. Will that materialize in fiscal '23 or starting into fiscal '24, I think it's in that time zone or in that timeline where, yes, we can probably start to see a little bit of a further acceleration on the new logo side. But today, we're super happy with the 50% to 20% new logo growth and the 120-plus percent net expansion rate. That gives us a sustainable 30-plus percent ARR growth. Our next question is from the line of Mike Cikos with Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question. First question was more about the guidance. And I want to come back to maybe some of the comments on guidance during the call. But we're in this macro environment currently, and I know that you guys are, I think the comment was that you're being prudent with guidance. Can you help us think about puts and takes to how you guys thought about guidance coming into this year? Is there -- how did you weigh some of those external factors as headwinds or tailwinds to your business over the course of the next 12 months? Mike, it's Kevin. So, there's some headwinds and some tailwinds that we obviously evaluate. We're certainly aware of the macro environment and the uncertainty that is out there today. So that's one thing that we've considered. The other thing that we were considering are the investments that we're making and when we think those are going to begin to pay off, as I just mentioned to Fatima. They're growing the direct sales organization, the hyperscalers the Deloitte partnership that we announced this morning, which is very exciting.
And I think all those can be some tailwinds, but there is some uncertainty in the actual world. I think that uncertainty though, when Rick and I think about the guidance, I think that's offset by the trend in digital transformation. Companies need to transform and the value that our software delivers help companies operate more efficiently and drive higher ROI. So, those are sort of the things that we consider. We certainly do appreciate we're operating in a different environment than we were 90 days ago, six months ago, and those are things that we put together [indiscernible]. Maybe just building on that for the follow-up. And I did -- I'm trying to put it in comparison to where we were last year when we first got our guidance for the year that we just finished, right? There were still some puts and takes last year when we were thinking about a normalizing environment post-COVID. And we've all seen how that's kind of played out to a certain extent. But is it fair to think that maybe with the current macro environment, there is maybe a bit more conservatism when thinking through, again, the kind of demand environment that we're in today and how these organizations respond accordingly? I think that's fair, Mike. I think there's a lot of uncertainty out in the world today. And I think that certainly, as we said in the prepared remarks, helped us establish sort of a prudent guide where we are. But we also don't want to get over our speed in terms of the top track here and set expectations too high. We're very bullish on the year. The Company is moving in the right direction, things are in motion and we're excited about it. But given that macro uncertainty, we think the guidance is prudent. Our next question is coming from the line of Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Kevin, I just wanted to start on the net new ARR ex-PERP in constant currency, and that's a mouthful it bounces around a little bit, but 7% growth in Q4. I think Russia accounts for a little bit of that. But if you want to maybe unpack a little bit of color on that 7% number in Q4, what the real number would be. And you made some comments on Q1 net new. I just wanted to clarify if you could maybe expand a little bit more on how you're thinking about Q1 net new ARR. Sure, and for those of you who are interested in our -- on our Investor Relations website, we do have the net new ARR broken out in the Reconciliation. But to answer your question, Mike, in Q4, you're absolutely right. The net new ARR was $71.5 million, actually 7%, and that was impacted by $6 million because of Russia. So normalizing that for Russia, that growth rate was 16%. For the year, as I'm sure you appreciate, the total net new ARR do grow to $267 million, $268 million. That was up 33% on a year-over-year basis.
So, that -- we're pleased with that. There was a change in seasonality that we've been talking about in fiscal '21 due to COVID, which made those year-over-year comps a little bit different in fiscal '22. We do believe year-over-year comps in fiscal '23 will normalize a little bit more, meaning, historically, we've always got about 40% of our net new business in the first half and 60% in the back half. That's fairly consistent with what we did in '22, and we think that will continue into '23. So I hope that helps Adam. And maybe just as a follow-up for Rick, obviously, big shoes to fill. But if you can maybe talk about some key characteristics that you and the Board will be seeking in Kevin's successor. I know you mentioned previously that you might be a little bit more open to M&A, for example. I'm not sure if that was maybe like a core competency that you'd be looking for? Just any kind of general characteristics that will be important to you. Thanks, Adam. It's big shoes to fill for sure with Kevin. So that's true and great to have them through the end of the year to make sure that we get exactly the right person on board. Dynatrace is a great company in a very exciting market space, obviously, impeccable financial results as we saw this quarter and has seen over the course of the last couple of years and beyond.
So, we believe that we will attract a very, very strong candidate into the role. The characteristics, obviously, you want global experience, you want multibillion-dollar scale ideally in terms of capabilities in the person's background and above and beyond all else. Perhaps, I want an exceptional business leader and partner to join our leadership team as we look at it.
So, those are some of the elements. You mentioned M&A, Adam. Obviously, M&A tuck in, as we talked about last quarter, is certainly on the docket. We're not looking at transformational M&A, but tuck in M&A is something that we'll look at. So if the person has that kind of experience as well, obviously that's a plus. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. This is Anushka for Matt Hedberg. So you're continuing to hire at a strong pace, and you're again expecting a similar growth in the quota-carrying reps in fiscal '23 or fiscal '22. Could you expand on how you think about hiring and attracting the right people in this competitive environment with labor shortages and wage inflation? We are adding very, very strong people. It's been amazing to watch over the last one, two, three quarters. I do introductory meetings with new hires, especially in our sales team, but really more broadly in on a very frequent basis. And the engagement passion, enthusiasm that we're getting the quality of the candidates we're seeing by way of resumes is very, very high.
So it gives us very strong confidence as we look to FY '23 as to both the numbers of our ability to recruit to the levels that we described in our prepared remarks, but also to the very high quality threshold that we have set for ourselves as we look to the future.
So far, end of the year, very, very strong. And I think Dynatrace is a brand is becoming more and more visible. And that brand awareness and recognition is assisting us in making sure we recruit the best talent as well. So, very optimistic on the recruiting front as we look at FY '23. Next question comes from the line of Koji Ikeda with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Kevin, congrats on the well-deserved upcoming break. I guess maybe the first one for Kevin or for Rick, thinking about the fiscal '23 operating margin guide, looks like it's about 22.5% there kind of at the midpoint. I wanted to ask how you're thinking about the margin guidance framework here, thinking about typical conservatism. Have you thought about it in the past, any sort of return to work or in-person expenses this year? And then I guess kind of following up on the last question, too, any sort of wage inflation or talent retention that's embedded in the guide this year? Yes, so from a wage inflation standpoint, the market is moving, as I think we all appreciate, and we have looked at that as an organization and made some nice adjustments in terms of cash compensation, also some long-term incentives and equity. So, we use the tools in our tool bag to make sure that we're meeting the requirements and demands of where the market is today.
From a margin standpoint, I think the way we think about these investments, these are targeted investments that we're making in the business in fiscal '23. They will happen during the course of the year. It's not going to happen all in one quarter. But then what we will see as we go into fiscal '24 is the margin we appreciate, right?
So, getting back to a 25% operating margin in fiscal '24, and frankly, going forward after that, there should be additional leverage in the model. So, the targeted investments this year, bringing margins down from 25% down to about 23%, and then we will see that re-accretion happening shortly thereafter. And then just one quick follow-up, if I may, pretty simple question. Just kind of thinking about the guidance here for the full year, both from a revenue and a margin standpoint, thinking about the macro-related headwinds out there. I mean, I guess, does it assume the guidance with the macro out there? Does it assume things get better, same or maybe even worse for the rest of the year? Thanks, Koji. I would say that it's a balanced view in evaluating the macro environment. We believe it's a prudent guide amidst macro constraints and considerations. But we're not making any prediction about the macro environment improving in any material way, either geopolitically or in terms of the macroeconomic environment with respect to inflation or other factors in the market. I would just add to that just add to that as well, so we're highly instrumented that we brought a very efficient business here for the last six years. We're super well instrumented in terms of visibility and we're making those investments. And if we do see a change in circumstance in the environment, I think you will see us react pretty promptly as well. Our next question comes from the line of Joel Fishbein with Truist. Please proceed with your question. Kevin, congrats to you as well and good luck. Rick, on the last call, you talked about doubling down on the Fed. I'd love to get your input on where we are in Fed and observability? And any color you could share there would be really helpful. Yes. So, the federal government opportunity, I think, is really significant for us. I've been engaged personally in that over the course of the last few months. And it is growing faster than the baseline growth of the Company in terms of overall ARR growth at a very nice fit.
I believe it's a significant opportunity for us to place additional bets and investments. So, that's precisely what we're doing as we look to FY '23. So, I'd corroborate all the comments from last quarter in terms of ongoing trends around federal government. And for that matter, also the slight environment we see as well. Our next question comes from the line of DJ Hynes with Canaccord. Please proceed with your question. Rick, a two-parter for you on the Deloitte partnership, and then a quick follow-up for Kevin. Just on Deloitte, curious what kind of RFP process went into that? I mean I know they're a customer, so maybe that was enough for them, but talk a little bit about why they landed on Dynatrace? And then part two of the question is just in your experience, does this get more or less likely that other SIs will kind of consolidate and build practices around Dynatrace? I don't know if there are fast followers in that industry or if they'd actually prefer to have some sort of differentiated offering? Any thoughts along those lines would be helpful. To start, I would say, we are very enthusiastic about the Deloitte partnership. I've spent personal time on this is the senior leadership team of Deloitte, and we believe that there is substantial opportunity in working numbers to look at. And it really does come back to our view of the overall environment for observability because as companies do digital transformative work and go through cloud migrations, we believe that Dynatrace can deliver a cloud done right. And it is that notion of reducing the gap between a digital transformation workload effort and moving to an observability solution with Dynatrace that really is our principal objective.
So if we can pull those things together and that's a substantial opportunity, Deloitte can do this for us. We're very excited with the partnership. You asked about how we got this point, they are a customer, but I assure you they did a thorough review based on their input to us of solutions in the market, and they believe that Dynatrace is the best solution for their target customer base, which aligns very nicely to ours and Global 15,000. So that's, I think, why they picked us. I think that this is just an on-ramp to additional opportunities with further global system integrators as we look ahead, because there's ongoing overlap with others as well. I think that there are additional opportunities to come in the future. And then, Kevin, the follow-up for you. Can you quantify the tax refund, and then confirm has that already been received in fiscal '23? Yes, DJ, it has. It was a little over $30 million that we received actually in April. Next question is from the line of Raimo Lenshow from Barclays. Please proceed with your question. It's Vinod on for Raimo. First, I just want to touch on adoption patterns for some of your newer modules. Can you just talk about how infrastructure growth trended this quarter? And then how have adoption patterns for other solutions like app security, trying to have dynamic infrastructure or are there any differences worth pointing out? It's Kevin. Yes, the infrastructure module continues to be at last quarter, I think we communicated it about a 70% growth rate on infrastructure module. The growth rate this quarter is fairly consistent with that. So, we're seeing continued adoption of over half of our customers have the infrastructure module. It's also still very early in terms of penetration there. As we've communicated in the past, we believe for every dollar our customer spends in apps on micro services, they should be spending another $1 on the infrastructure side.
And right now, they're spending about $0.15 to $0.20 on the dollar. So a big opportunity to continue to expand our customer base there, but also the opportunity -- additional opportunity to expand in our customer base in terms of further penetration. So, that's on the infrastructure side. App Security, given some of the things that happened in the world Log4j, the demand there is very good. We've converted a lot of customers as well. Not a meaningful mover to the ARR line at this point. So, we do think that's going to be a mover as we continue through fiscal '23. And then just one more for me. You mentioned you've hired about 30% of sales reps this year and you plan on doing that again this year. Can you just remind us how long does it take to get a rep fully productive? And kind of what have you learned over the last year or so, just as an organization in terms of kind of expediting that process? So, it's in that -- it's in the four- to five-quarter time frame. It is a very big priority for our organization. So, we've made big investments in terms of our sales enablement organization our training ongoing education. We just had our big sales kickoff that Rick mentioned on the call as well, where we've got the whole team together for further education. So, we are making investments and we do believe over the next couple of years, we can make a meaningful improvement in time to productivity. Next question is from the line of Kamil Mielczarek with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. One more follow-up on the macro. So, we've heard from several other software companies this earnings season that while demand was generally strong. Some companies did see one or two deals slip in Europe. Can you talk about what you're seeing in that market? And more generally, have you seen any changes in customer conversations and their willingness to adopt the observability tools? Kamil, it isn't our view that we've seen any slippage in deals at least at the moment, inclusive of Europe. So, we are not seeing that as an impact to our business at the current time. It's certainly possible that, that changes in the future. But at least so far, our pipeline and deal flow has continued to remain in roughly the same rate as expected. And Rick, you spoke about the lag between cloud transitions and adoption of observability. And we talked about this in the past where often the Company first tries an open source product or attempts to build something internally, which, as you mentioned, is very difficult to do today. So, two questions on that. First, can you provide more detail on what you're doing to cut down that lag in purchasing decisions? And second, we've seen strong rates of cloud transitions over the past two years and likely acceleration in '21. Do you think Dynatrace is seeing the benefits of these accelerated cloud transitions today? Or given the lag, is there potential for this to be a driver of higher levels of net new customer wins later this year or maybe in fiscal '24? I think, yes, in terms of seeing the benefit of cloud transition, the movement of customers and Global 15,000 companies, in particular, to the cloud is absolutely fueling demand for Dynatrace and fueling the increased interest in the Dynatrace platform. So, I'd say, absolutely is the answer to that question.
In terms of the lag, that really is the opportunity that we're driving against, how do we shorten that gap between the time of the cloud migration and an observability decision? And so too many customers or companies are deploying home build solutions, simple dashboard and space on open source tools, and it is those companies that deploy Dynatrace out to show at the time of cloud migration that we believe get the best performance.
In terms of their overall cloud platform and get the best results, in terms of precise answers rather than dashboards and data to glass. So that's really what we're pushing. How are we doing that? Partners as well as our direct efforts in terms of new logo generation, where we've been talking about partnerships like the Deloitte partnership should help in that regard. So, that's where we're focused. Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Congrats on a fantastic finish to fiscal year. Rick, I'm curious to get your perspective on customer conversations given that your customers presumably have labor shortage, supply chain shortage, inflationary pressures, how are they prioritizing Dynatrace? And what do those ROI conversations look like, especially since you've had 1.5 months or so after the quarter ended? Are there -- is there any change in the tone of how Dynatrace is being prioritized? And I have a follow-up question for Kevin. Cash, I would say that if anything, the ROI for Dynatrace is as strong as ever, especially amidst IT shortages of personnel, as well as wage inflation in that market. It's very difficult, as you all know, to retain IT people at the current time. And that's resulting in a need for greater automation, automation of tools, automation of processes et cetera. Dynatrace can bring that to companies. And so if anything, we should be able to deliver improved results to companies that are experiencing those kinds of shortages. We actually do see it as well in terms of ongoing strength of our services bookings in that more companies are asking us to do more work for them in terms of deployments to ensure that we get seeded as quickly and effectively as possible inside the infrastructures. Kevin, congratulations on your retirement. I was wondering, if I could get your perspective on the quality of the customer base kind of exposure to unprofitable tech companies, if you will, that is somewhat material or not your company for certain other companies. And the risk factors associated with collectability, ongoing business conditions for certain aspects of your customer base that may be impacted by the recession. Maybe we're starting to see some negative effect, but maybe you're more insulated. But any statistics you get thrown with respect to the diversification of your customer base or industry verticals and the quality of their own financials that can give you more conviction that those pressures are not an issue for you guys? Thanks, Kash, appreciate it. Look, we're very excited about customer base that we have, right? We target, as you know, the Global 15,000 largest enterprises in the world. We had best-in-class retention rates. And so, we're enterprise-first, we had very high-quality revenue, and we think that's going to be very durable for the long term. So, it's low churn, sticky products, high ROI.
And when CIOs, CTOs, they're looking to make investments we believe observability is going to be one of those areas because we're just talking about the value that we deliver, especially in an environment where there's IT shortages. We're going to help these companies become more efficient. So, we've thought about that as well, given the environment that we operate in. We think that's a big asset to the Company. Kash, I'd like to just add a quick point on the notion that you raised around profitable software companies. It is really important to, I think, to pick and understand that Dynatrace is operating at a very high level of growth, mid-30s adjusted ARR as we discussed, but also a very strong level of profitability and free cash. This is -- as you saw in the guide at 29% to 30% guide for FY '23 in terms of free cash flow at very strong and good operating margins that we expect to actually re-accrete in the early portion of FY '24 into the mid-20% range.
And on top of that, a very strong and solid growth, for a company that's been delivering, I guess, a Rule of 60 over the course of the past couple of years. So we intend to continue to operate the Company in a very balanced way and maintaining that profitability and strong cash flow through the future of the Company. That it's absolutely well appreciated. I was more curious about your customers and their profitability and they're going to renew contracts. But I think Kevin covered that. Thank you so much. Good to see the conviction. Next question is from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO. Please proceed with your question. I have two as well. First on the broader side, I wanted to think about how Rick and Kevin, you're thinking about portfolio expansion over the next two years. I think there's a perception in the marketplace that perhaps one your primary competitors is innovating faster and perhaps populating their portfolio more rapidly than you are. And I just wanted to kind of get your take over the next two years, how should investors be thinking about the expansion of portfolio, if you're at X now, what does it look like in two years X plus something? If you could just speak to the investment dollars you're making surrounding R&D and how that might expand your portfolio? And then I have a follow-up, please. I am very, very pleased with the rate of growth of our innovation engine and how we're investing here. We have, as I mentioned, about 1/3 of the people of Dynatrace in R&D or R&D-related activities. So, this is a very sizable investment for the Company that we're driving forth. We are making investments, as we've discussed in the infrastructure area in the logging area with which we, of course, are very excited and then on into application security, cloud automation and other modules, as I described at the outset. So, we are innovating, innovating aggressively. I do think that there is a difference in perception just based upon overall R&D spend, just relative to where we conduct our R&D primarily across the globe. But that doesn't change the commitment of us to driving the R&D engine as we have been in the past. And my follow-up, Kevin, probably is more directed to you. And again, sort of preliminary congratulations on your pending transition. What's the behavior been of the perpetual customers? And what I mean by that, have the perpetual customers been leaving that license or that contract in place and just paying the maintenance? Or have there been some conversion of the perpetual either in terms of add-ons or even transitioning away from perpetual? I'm just trying to understand how the underlying economics have flowed and as we think about FY '23, how that may flow. Yes. If you go back, Keith, a couple of years, and then think about where those customers are today, I would say probably half of those customers have converted to subscription model to a pure model. And the reason they've done that is, when we started to add additional offerings, whether it's AppSec or them or infrastructure, those were only available on a subscription basis. So, over the last couple of years, we've been moving our customers in that direction. And as you also know, in the last six, seven quarters, we haven't sold any new perpetual licenses. So, that underneath the covers, that will lead to preparing. So, they're converting the perpetual and then moving away from maintenance and converting that to subscription. At times of expansion, that's when we see doing it. They want to cover more apps, more micro services. They want to add them or infrastructure. Those are the points where we're having those conversations in moving them. At this time, we're nearing the end of our question-and-answer session. There is time for one final question, which is coming from the line of Gray Powell with BTIG. Okay. Great. Congratulations on the good results. So, yes, maybe on the new product side, how are you thinking about pricing on the log monitoring product in the second half of the year? How disruptive could you be there to that space? And then, how additive could log monitoring be to your typical customers' build? Well, the first element on log monitoring is that it is, we believe, a significant opportunity for disruption in the market. We do not look at log monitoring in isolation. That is to say that that we don't look to sell log monitoring in a unique independent way.
We really do believe that it is part and parcel to the value of the entire Dynatrace portfolio to have logging capabilities essentially built in to evaluate that along with apps and micro services, infrastructure, AppSec and the other modules that we offer. So that's sort of point number one is we really do believe that it is the value of the portfolio as a whole that log monitoring will get added to.
That said, log monitoring in and of itself in terms of the solution that we offer, we believe, there will be a leapfrog solution and will add an opportunity for significant ARR growth into the future as we end up FY '24 and beyond. And then I guess just a follow-up would be -- I mean, how do you think the traction -- and I know it's really early, -- but how can the traction there compare with what you've seen in the last couple of years with your infrastructure monitoring side? Should it be like as good, better? Any thought there Logging is really quite consistent with the way that we look at infrastructure in terms of this opportunity for growth. It will be a consumption-based model with the way that logging typically would occur from a pricing standpoint. So, it will be essentially a pricing model that is oriented to consumption around logging. But yes, I think it's safe to think of it as infrastructure like in terms of this opportunity for substantial growth as we look at it. Yes, very helpful. Thank you very much. So that brings us to a close. Thank you, all, for joining today. We really do appreciate your support and your engagement with Dynatrace.
FY '22 was really an extraordinary year for us. We drove record levels of ARR and revenue growth, very strong operating margins, excellent cash flow. We remain committed to that ongoing strong financial performance for the future. And I can assure you that we've got 3,600 plus or so people who are extremely passionate about the opportunity that Dynatrace has ahead.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Noelle Faris, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ms. Faris. Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Dynatrace's first quarter fiscal 2023 earnings conference call. With me on the call today are Rick McConnell, Chief Executive Officer; and Kevin Burns, Chief Financial Officer.

The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on August 3, 2022. Dynatrace disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances.
As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial measures during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP measures can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. Unless otherwise noted, the growth rate we discuss today are non-GAAP, reflecting constant currency growth. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP measures, please refer to today's earnings press release and financial presentation under the Events section of our website.
And with that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Rick McConnell. Rick? Thanks, Noelle, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's call. Let me start by saying that I am proud of the Dynatrace team and our solid first quarter performance. In particular, we saw a continuation of our mid-30s growth in adjusted ARR again in the first quarter at 34% year-over-year.
Subscription revenue came in at $250 million, an increase of 32% year-over-year in constant currency. And non-GAAP operating income was $60 million or 23% of revenue. This is a testament to the strength of our market, the significant value of our platform and the ongoing durability of our business model, which, combined, enable us to run a business that delivers high growth, with strong profitability and free cash flow.
Kevin will share more details about our Q1 performance and guidance in a moment. In the meantime, I'd like to share my view of current market trends and our platform leadership and our operational approach to the remainder of this fiscal year.
Let me start with the underlying market opportunity and trend that have been fueling our growth today. As we've said in the past, digital transformation has become ubiquitous. Observability as well as application security solutions are still at an early stage of evolution, and yet are rapidly becoming essential element of successful cloud deployments.
In our estimation, the current economic challenges will drive an even higher priority for digital transformation initiatives given the demand for greater efficiency of IT resources. Like cloud deployments typically yield data that is exploding in volume and complexity, which companies are simply not equipped to handle with internally-built solutions. This is driving an enormous market opportunity in observability.
Dynatrace's ability to drive greater efficiency at lower cost places us near the top of the strategic IT priority list now more than ever. And as our customers widely proclaim, organizations need Dynatrace.
Based on these fundamentals, we are confident that the digital transformation trend will continue to fuel our growth for many years to come. Our durable enterprise customer base, coupled with our recurring subscription revenue model, provide us with relative resiliency even in an uncertain economic environment. This is a growth market and as our Q1 results illustrate, we are a growth company.
At the same time, we are obviously not immune to the rapidly evolving macro environment, which we saw primarily in the form of elongated sales cycles in the latter half of June. We saw this most notably in our new logo close rate during the quarter with 135 added, consistent with the first quarter of last year.
For our installed base, we delivered our 17th straight quarter of a net expansion rate greater than 120%. Our existing customers VOS as an essential partner to their ecosystem and are eager to expand their usage of Dynatrace given the proven value we provide. As a testament to this, our average ARR per customer has now grown to over $300,000.
In updating our guidance, we believe it's prudent to assume that this economic uncertainty continues through the balance of our fiscal year. Our expectations assume greater conservatism in ARR and topline growth as a reflection of the macro environment. We continue to be a leader in enterprise observability and are addressing a huge market with tremendous growth opportunities.
I will talk further about how we intend to operationalize this plan in a moment. But before doing so, I'd like to reemphasize our platform differentiation and why Dynatrace continues to grow at a rapid rate.
Digital transformation is, of course, not just oriented to resource efficiency and offloading workload management. Organizations depend on software for essentially every facet of their operations to deliver products, facilitate commerce, drive supply chain efficiency, engage with employees, and much more. To achieve these goals, organizations expect their software to work perfectly.
To help customers enable this performance, our approach to observability is radically different. Dynatrace provides not a single product, but rather a comprehensive software intelligence platform, covering end-to-end observability with sophisticated AI ops capabilities unmatched in our industry. It combines the deepest and broadest multi-cloud observability solution with continuous runtime application security.
We focus on global 15,000 enterprise accounts where data volume and complexity are highest and where our scale and automation enable them to run their businesses most effectively. This is the power of Dynatrace and why customers choose us.
Whereas other approaches deliver dashboards, Dynatrace delivers precise answers and intelligent automation from data to help customers navigate the massive complexity that comes with digital transformation initiatives. It enables our customers to deliver flawless and secure digital interactions by providing broad-based situational awareness of their cloud ecosystem at all times, and enabling them to take action immediately to ensure maximum uptime and performance.
And over time, customers will use the intelligence we provide to integrate the Dynatrace platform directly into their application as code or auto remediation. Industry analysts corroborate our leadership position.
Recently, Gartner released its annual Magic Quadrant for application performance monitoring and observability, naming Dynatrace a leader for the 12th consecutive time, and in the Gartner critical capabilities for APM, and observability report, our platform differentiation compared to the competition is even more indelible, with Dynatrace leading in four of six use cases for DevOps and application development, site reliable engineering, and platform ops, IT operations and digital experience monitoring.
I'd like to share a couple of examples of customer wins this quarter that highlight our platform strength. First, a major California insurance company was leveraging a siloed approach to their cloud-first strategy. These tools provide disparate information that was not integrated into their IT services management system. They realized they couldn't measure what they couldn't see, and they were unable to improve what they couldn't measure.
By consolidating these tools through deployment of an end-to-end observability solution from Dynatrace, this customer dramatically enhance its visibility in their entire ecosystem. This resulted in vastly improved operational management and AI-driven insights, while reducing costs.
Let's take another example. A large supermarket chain with an extremely complex ecosystem, dependent upon dozens of SaaS and third-party tools, was looking for comprehensive visibility across their environment.
During the evaluation process, they suffered a production system outage impacting their loyalty program. Dynatrace was able to identify the root cause and resolve the issue within minutes rather than hours or days, avoiding lost revenue, wasted marketing dollars and damage to the customer loyalty they have invested to build.
They selected Dynatrace, because of the precision of our answers, and our enablement of immediate action to ensure maximum uptime and performance. These are just two examples of the trends that are widespread throughout our customer base. Our customers' jobs have never been harder. Now more than ever, it is critical for them to make observability an integral part of every cloud deployment.
At Dynatrace, we refer to this as cloud done right. We've never been in a stronger position to make consistent leverage the Dynatrace platform of reality across a wide array of cloud environments. We also have ample runway to continue to expand our footprint within our installed base. We have only just begun to gain meaningful momentum with our application security module.
Application security was a brand-new market for us less than two years ago. And just this quarter, we closed a number of six-figure deals, including Fannie Mae, UPS and Kroger. And our R&D team continues its fervent commitment to innovation. We believe that, the log market is ripe for disruption. We remain on track to release a dramatically enhanced logging capability based on a massively scalable data store and platform evolution we called BRAO [ph] in the back half of this year.
Customers frequently tell us they are generally satisfied with the functionality, visibility and cost of their current logging tools. And they want a highly performance and cost-effective log monitoring solution that scales with the largest businesses.
Customers also see enormous value in treating logs as part of an end-to-end observability solution and data set rather than a siloing tool. We recently closed a seven-figure deal with a major national bank to replace their existing log and security offer and a major retailer invested in air log capabilities. We look forward to sharing more details about this offering in the coming months.
This brings me to my final topic, and that is our plan to navigate through the current economic backdrop. I recently attended an event in which the speaker reminded a number of CEOs of a common auto racing expression, that drivers win races in the curbs.
Unlike straightaways, which are more predictable, curves upset the status quo. Turns can bring the unexpected. They are where races are often won or lost. Gartner talks about winning in the turns as a time when leaders must sharpen decision-making capabilities, manage resources strategically and be ready to take the lead.
I believe there are some parallels that we can apply to the current macro backdrop, and we are being thoughtful and strategic about how we execute in this turn. There are several actions we are taking to support our long-term growth objectives to enable us to gain market share and accelerate platform leadership, while maintaining healthy margins.
First, we have adjusted increases in headcount and OpEx through the balance of the year to deliver operating margins in line with our prior guidance to reflect the revised top line model. We still plan to add nearly 800 people during FY 2023, reflecting our commitment to ongoing investments in our growth. Innovation and go-to-market expansion remain top priorities for us, and we'll continue to invest most aggressively in these strategic areas.
Through the end of July, we grew our direct sales force by 30% year-over-year, and we plan to continue to grow the team to support our growth objectives. We are also focused on building more high-quality pipeline, rapidly qualifying leads and infusing even more rigor into our deal validation process.
On the indirect side, we will continue to expand relationships with the three major hyperscalers for increased leverage and sales cycle acceleration. We’ll also continue to expand our relationships with global system integrators.
Last quarter, we announced that Deloitte had selected Dynatrace to build observability into their digital transformation practice. And we expect to share similar announcements with other system integrators in the future.
Overall, we have proven our discipline in delivering growth in challenging environments, while managing top to bottom line in a balanced way. And we plan to continue to execute in this fashion looking ahead.
In closing, Q1 was a solid start, even amidst macro uncertainty. We remain highly confident in our market opportunity, the resiliency of our enterprise customer base and our platform leadership. I expect us to continue to innovate with passion, which is paramount to our future growth and core to culture.
We plan to use this period to increase differentiation from our competitors. We're going to manage prudently from a financial perspective. And we intend to invest thoughtfully in strategic opportunities to emerge even stronger competitively, than before.
With that, let me turn the call over to Kevin. Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As Rick mentioned, we delivered a solid first quarter in a dynamic environment. Overall, the resiliency of our subscription model and the strengthening of our enterprise customer base are reflected in our Q1 performance. This provides a strong foundation from which we expect to continue to deliver a balanced business of growth, profitability and cash flow, consistent with the last three years operating in the public market.
As with previous quarters, I will focus on adjusted ARR growth, as it normalizes for currency fluctuations and the wind down of perpetual ARR. Please note that all growth rates will be year-over-year and in constant currency, unless otherwise stated. Dynatrace delivered 34% adjusted ARR growth in the first quarter, representing the ninth straight quarter of mid-30% growth, highlighting the resiliency and predictability of our subscription business model.
ARR for the first quarter was $1.031 billion. Excluding the currency and perpetual license ARR headwinds, we grew net new ARR by $281 million year-over-year, which was 28% growth. Before I discuss the building blocks of growth for the business, let me provide a little color on the macro impact we saw in the first quarter. Throughout April and May, we were pleased with strength in linearity, as well as new logo wins and net expansion rates. The tone of customer conversations was positive and our pipeline coverage was consistent with historical trends.
However, as we entered the final two weeks of the quarter, we saw increased deal scrutiny and additional budget authorization requirements that led to a lengthening in sales cycles, primarily impacting new logos. Our win rates remained healthy and consistent with the last few quarters. And deals that we did not close in Q1 either remain in the pipeline or have been signed. These blocks growth continue to be the combination of new logos added to the Dynatrace platform and net expansion with existing customers.
As Rick mentioned, we added 135 new logos in the first quarter, consistent with Q1 of last year. And we were pleased to see that more than half of these new logos land into a three or more modules. And our net expansion rate for the first quarter was once again above 120%.
From an existing customer standpoint, we continue to see strength in multi-module adoption, with more than half of our customers now using three-plus modules at an average ARR of nearly $500,000 per customer. Given the significant cross-sell and expansion opportunity in our customer base, we continue to believe that the average ARR per enterprise customer could be $1 million or more, providing ample runway for expansion with our current platform.
Overall, we are very pleased with the resiliency of our enterprise customers that drove a healthy first quarter performance. Our existing customers view us as an essential part of their ecosystem, given the proven value, operating efficiencies and insights that we deliver.
Moving on to revenue. Total revenue for the first quarter was $267 million, exceeding the high end of our guidance range by $4 million and up 32% year-over-year. Subscription revenue for the first quarter was $250 million, up 32%, a $3 million beat vers the high end of our guidance. With respect to margins, gross margin for the first quarter was 84%, down 1 point from Q1 of last year, primarily due to the investment in our customer success initiative, which led to a further strengthening of our impressive growth retention and net expansion rates.
As we have said before, we have a very healthy margin profile, reflecting the value and efficiency of the Dynatrace platform. As Rick mentioned, innovation and go-to-market expansion remain top priorities for us. For the first quarter, we invested $41 million in R&D, up 35% from last year. We continue to successfully attract and retain talent in our R&D organization, consistent with our expectations.
On the go-to-market side, we invested $94 million in sales and marketing this quarter, up 31% over last year and within our current target investment zone of 34% to 36% of revenue. Our non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $60 million, resulting in an operating margin of 23%, in line with our expectations given the planned targeted investments we previously communicated. On the bottom line, non-GAAP net income was $52 million or $0.18 per share.
Looking at the balance sheet. As of June 30, we had $571 million of cash, an increase of $184 million compared to the same period last year and inclusive of $120 million of debt repayments. Our free cash flow was $136 million compared to $81 million in the same period last year. As a reminder, cash flow in the first quarter was positively impacted by a tax refund of over $30 million. This was previously expected to be received last year. On a trailing 12-month basis, our free cash flow was $289 million or 29% of revenue. We remain very pleased with our continued healthy cash generation.
The last financial measure that I would like to discuss is our remaining performance obligation. RPO was approximately $1.53 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of 27% over Q1 of last year. The current portion of RPO, which we expect to recognize as revenue over the next four quarters, was $877 million, an increase of 28% year-over-year. We are very pleased with the growth in RPO.
However, we continue to believe ARR is the best metric to understand the business' performance as they remove variability associated with billing and contracting modification.
Now let me turn to guidance. There are a few things to keep in mind with respect to our guidance. First, we remain confident in the long-term durability and predictability of our growth. At the same time, we want to be mindful given the extended sales cycles we saw in the last few weeks of Q1. Our revised guidance assumes these trends will continue for the balance of fiscal 2023.
Given that, we believe the majority of the macro headwind will be concentrated in new logo growth. As such, we now expect new logo additions in fiscal 2023 to be consistent with the 700 new logos we added in fiscal 2022. We are confident in the resiliency of our customer base and the ongoing value we deliver to our customers, and we believe the macro impact on this cohort will be less significant. In fact, we saw our best ever gross retention rate this past quarter, and it has been consistently trending up for the last 2 years. We continue to believe our net expansion rate will be above 120% for fiscal 2023.
Second, with almost half of our business denominated in foreign currency, continued strength of the USD creates a sizable headwind. We now expect full year ARR constant currency impact to be approximately $40 million and $47 million on revenue.
And finally, consistent with prior guidance, the perpetual license wind down for fiscal 2023 is expected to be approximately $8 million, or 80 basis points, consistent with prior guidance. The headwind in Q2 will be approximately 2.5 percentage point and will then taper off throughout the year. With that in mind, let's start with our guidance for the full year, again, with growth rates in constant currency.
Let's start with ARR. We expect ARR to be between $1.213 billion and $1.226 billion, representing an adjusted ARR growth of 27% to 28%. This is a 2 percentage point decline from previous guidance, mostly driven by the lower new logo expectations for fiscal 2023.
In terms of Q2 seasonality, we expect roughly 18% of the annual net new ARR to close in Q2. We now expect total revenue to be between $1.125 billion and $1.136 billion and subscription revenue to be between $1.053 billion to $1.062 billion. Both of which result in 26% to 27% year-over-year growth and a 1 percentage point decline from previous guidance.
From a profit standpoint, we remain committed to the margin expectation we set for fiscal 2023. We are reaffirming our non-GAAP operating margin guidance of 22.5% to 23%. As Rick mentioned, we are a growth business and we continue to hire. However, we are slowing the rate of hiring and adjusting certain operating expenses to align with our revised top line expectations.
We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.73 to $0.76 per share based on 292 million to 294 million diluted shares outstanding and a non-GAAP effective cash tax rate of 11%. And finally, we expect free cash flow to be between $310 million and $325 million, or 27.5% to 28.5% of revenue.
Looking at Q2, we expect total revenue to be between $272 million and $275 million, or 26% to 28% growth. Subscription revenue is expected to be between $255 million and $257 million, up 26% to 27% year-over-year. From a profit standpoint, non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $62 million and $64.5 million, 23% to 23.5% of revenue, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.18 to $0.19 per share.
In summary, we are pleased with our first quarter fiscal 2023 performance, where we saw solid ARR and top line growth, combined with healthy cash margins amidst a dynamic environment. We have a proven track record of consistent execution. We are being mindful of our investment levels and we'll continue to prioritize investments strategically in commercial expansion and innovation to support sustained growth. Our strong financials, subscription model, and enterprise customer base continue to position us for resilient and predictable growth and profitability as we move forward.
And with that, we will open the line for your questions. Operator? At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Okay. Thank you and good morning. Rick, I just wanted to start on the upcoming logging solution and the infrastructure product more broadly. I know that you've talked about that solution potentially being as big as APM over time. So, an interesting growth driver moving forward. Wondering if you can speak to maybe the pipeline and early-stage trajectory of that product. And any additional color around the key competitive differentiation and pricing on logging would be helpful. Thanks. Great. Thanks very much, Adam. First, infrastructure continues as a module to grow much faster than our standard ARR, our average ARR growth. So, we feel very, very positive about ongoing infrastructure growth. It is a core element to integrating that into our end-to-end observability platform, inclusive of APM plus infrastructure log, new experience and others. So, it is a core part of the solution.
With respect to logging, we feel great about the development of where we are. We're very much on track in delivery of Rail in the second half of this year. We are already in the process of beginning early access, what we call our EAP or Early Access Program to the solution.
We do believe, as I said in my prepared remarks, that this is a market and opportunity very ripe for disruption. We're focused on delivering a highly performance solution, at great price points with tremendous scale. It doesn't have the issue of cold to warm repopulation or a pullback of the data. So, we're in very good shape and we look forward to releasing the solution later this year. Great. And maybe just as a quick follow-up for Kevin. And this might be hard to do, but it -- could you maybe bifurcate core business versus new product expectations built into guidance for the rest of the year? Rick mentioned logging solutions on track for the back half. I'm just wondering, I think that's mostly not built into guidance, but I'm wanting to confirm that. Thank you. Yes, hi Adam. So, from a portfolio standpoint, as Rick mentioned, I think we're going to continue to strengthen the infrastructure product. The new logging capabilities will be a contributor, primarily towards the end of Q3 going into Q4 but obviously, a much more meaningful contributor over the next two years, where we certainly think, within two years, that can be a $100 million piece of business for us.
So, the other component from a core module standpoint, apps and microservices continues to grow very well, generally in line with our ARR growth, maybe a little bit smaller has grown faster.
And then app security, we've had some nice progress here over the last four or five quarters. We're gaining more and more momentum there as well. So, I definitely think the new product introductions are paying dividends, following the back half a little bit more. But as we go into FY 2024, they’ll become a meaningful -- much more meaningful contributor. Yes. Sounds like a lot of exciting stuff ahead. Thank you so much. Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Great. Thanks for taking my questions and thanks for all the detail, guys. Rick, I guess, for you, on the elongated deal cycles, was there a geographic? Was anything geographic there on some of the new business side? Was it more European, was it North America? Just curious on that aspect of it. Hey, Matt. I would say that we saw a modestly incremental impact in Europe. But it really was a global slowdown, or I would say, a global extension of deal cycle that we saw in late June. So modest in Europe, but the global in nature. Global. Okay, okay. That's helpful. And then Dynatrace has been around for a long time, and it's been through many economic cycles. And I like your analogy of when races are won in the turn. Although, you're tempering some of your new business expectations based off the macros, has there been periods of time where, historically, customers that are perhaps running multiple observability or monitor entries, look at this as an opportunity to say, hey, like I'm running for, I don't need to -- I'm going to try to consolidate on maybe one or two. Could that actually help new business sales at some point here as customers try to do maybe more with fewer vendors and maybe standardize even more so on a Dynatrace? Absolutely. It's a great observation. We do see it certainly in our pipeline in terms of opportunities for consolidation of other tools, and it occurs all the time. So that is a source of potential new logo, and certainly, market share increases that we see, in part come from precisely that phenomenon. Great. Thanks, guys. Our next question is from Kamil Mielczarek with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. Morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Can you update us on how churn looks in the quarter? It looks like it may have picked up. And how much of that is attributable to the planned decline in non-strategic customers? And what are your expectations for customer churn through the end of the year? Kamil, I'm assuming you're talking about customer count churn, is that? That's right. Yes, yes. So as we communicated over the last four to five quarters, we do have a small set of customers who's becoming smaller and smaller, that probably close to over 150, 200 customers with very low sort of combined single-digit ARR single products, perhaps running a synthetic product or not deployed across an organization. These are non-core customers to us. We are certainly working to expand them, but they're going to continue to decline.
So what you've seen over the last four quarters is really a burn down of this low customer sort of AR cohort. We think that will continue for another quarter or two. I think we're coming to the end of that cycle. The new logos that we've been adding to the -- when you think about the growth in the business, we're landing them at a healthy AR.
And more importantly, I think, Kamil, is that they're landing with -- be it the platform. And they're landing with three modules: apps, microservices, DEM, infrastructure. And when our customers have those components that those solutions deployed, it's so much more stickier and their net expansion rates are so much healthier.
So the way we think about it is, it's a little bit of a churn on the customer count side. As anticipated, it does not move the needle from an AR standpoint. And we think we're going to come out of this with a super strong full customer base that has a great ability to. That's very helpful. And then if I could just follow up on free cash flow. Margin was very strong in the quarter, I think, over 50%, at a multiyear high. Can you provide some more detail on what drove the free cash flow strength in the quarter? And given the strong start to the year, why bring down your full year free cash flow margin guide? Sure. So great free cash flow number in the Q1. There's a lot of seasonality, I think, as you know, in our business, we had a very strong bookings quarter in Q4 that resulted in a very high ARR balance. In addition, we received a tax refund of about $30 million. So despite -- if you back out the $30 million tax refund, we still had a really healthy free cash flow number in the quarter based on the health of the business over Q3 and Q4 that led to increased collection. So that all bodes well for RPO, for deferred revenue, for revenue visibility.
When we think about the guide for the year though, we want to be careful in this environment. So we are assuming that ARR will be coming down by about $20 million on a constant currency basis. And as a result of that, that will be resulting from lower bookings and billings. So a little bit more prudence and conservatism on that free cash flow number. We've been generating healthy cash margins in the business for many years, and we expect that to continue. So the way we do that is it's just a slight sweep based on current market conditions. That’s very helpful. Thanks, guys. Our next question comes from Mike Cikos with Needham & Co. Please proceed with your question. Hey, guys. Thanks for get me on here you have Mike Cikos. I wanted to ask about these elongated cycles that you're talking to. And really, my sense based on some of your commentary is it was just the last two weeks of June where this really picked up. So I'm curious with what you saw between deals either staying in the pipeline or closing since then. Can you help us separate the two? Like how -- what is that number that has closed versus remains in the pipeline? And then the second part of that question is, has the behavior from your customers been consistent through July, or are we seeing a further elongation of those cycles as we move away from June? Mike, it's Kevin. So if we go back and sort of revisit the last two weeks of the quarter, what we saw -- we saw a continued strength in our existing customer expansion numbers, right? There was a little bit of pressure there just due to multiple approvals required on some budget items. So a little bit of that pushed into Q2. The bigger change really was in the new logos where -- we saw this during COVID, right? People, when they're looking at a new solution, may be a little bit more tempered in their buying patterns. So we saw some deals push from Q1 into Q2 from a new logo standpoint. And we certainly have closed some of those. Some of those remain in the pipeline.
But I think when we think about the next couple of quarters, Q2, Q3, Q4, we just think there's going to be sort of this push of new logos throughout the course of the year just based on buying patterns and how we've seen new logos come, and those things are going to take a little bit longer. So overall, we're pleased with the customer -- existing customer expansion in the quarter. New logos, the way we think about it is the Q1 push is going to just keep pushing into Q2, Q3, and Q4. We're obviously very targeted at adding new logos to the franchise. It's super-important for the long-term health of the business. But given the current marketing conditions, we wanted to call sort of flat new logo growth on a year-over-year basis, which means we'll add 700 new logos this year.
So, that's how we think about it. No changes in market conditions from the end of June into where we are today. So, no further deterioration, said differently. So we'll see how the quarter plays out. But we could take all that into account when we guide. Thank you for that. I appreciate the color. And if I could just squeeze one more in. When I think about the budget pressures or maybe some of these deals pushing from, let's say, increased scrutiny, are you seeing new logos land smaller then? And then is there any way -- I know that you guys target the Global 15000. But to the extent, has there been any delineation if I think about like the ultra-mega enterprise customers versus maybe more mid-market type customers as far as that customer behavior we're talking to? So generally, I think as you appreciate, our trailing 12-month new logo land is $105,000, $110,000 in net that zip code. It's been increasing over the last four to five quarters, primarily due to the fact that customers are landing with the three modules that I mentioned earlier.
Q1, the number came down a little bit. I wouldn't call it a meaningful mover and I don't think it's a leading indicator of deal size at this point. We love the $100,000 landing zone. It's a great way to get into an organization, highlight certain applications in the full stack and expand from there. It's also $100,000 purchase. It's not a significant purchase from an enterprise level. So, it means out those budget approvals and results in we believe, faster time to market, faster time to close deals.
So, look, overall, yes, to answer your question, slight decline in average land on the new logo side. We don't think that's necessarily a trend that's going to continue. We make $100,000 sort of land for an enterprise customer that gets popped in. Terrific. Thank you for the color. I'll pass it on. Our next question comes from Erik Suppiger with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question. Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. One, you had mentioned a target of 800 employees or 800 new employees for the year. Can you give us a sense of where you are in terms of that hiring to-date? Hi Erik, it's Kevin. So, we got up to a great start in the first quarter. From a sales standpoint, our current quota capacity, as Rick mentioned, has grown 30%, that’s great. Our R&D organization made significant progress as well from a hiring standpoint. So, off to a good start.
Close to about 300 new hires in the first quarter out of the 800 that we're projecting for the year. So, pleased with the performance. And as we've talked about, we've brought down our original hiring targets, which were generally going to be in line with the revenue growth assumptions. And we just updated our headcount growth rates down -- back down to where we think revenue growth rates will be for the year. So, growing headcount in that -- new headcount in that 25%, 26% year-over-year.
We will continue the focus and go to market and we're going to continue to focus on, obviously, R&D innovation. And then obviously, we want the appropriate metrics from a customer success standpoint that we want -- so we want to make sure we're high in there based on the revenue trajectory of the business. And we can think of the growth within your sales organization in that type of growth range, like you were just saying, 25%, 27%? We -- well, so sales has been growing. And sales capacity, so I think direct sales reps grew 30% through the end of July on a year-over-year basis. Our stated goal for our sales rep headcount growth this year is 30% as well. That may move around a little bit, Erik, depending on the trajectory of the business coming off of Q2, going into Q3 and Q4. But we are prioritizing the investments in the direct business as we believe, once we get through some of these macro pressures, it will put us in a much stronger position to continue to grow and perhaps even accelerate growth going into FY 2024 depending on where the market is at that point. Okay. And lastly, your security module, I know it's still early. But is that on a trajectory where it could reach an attach rate that's comparable to your other popular modules? Is that something you see in another couple of years, or where do you think that attach rate could fall out longer term? We absolutely believe so, Erik. It's a very popular module, especially since Lafarge occurred in the December time frame. Our vulnerability management solution seems to have hit a nerve in the market for sure and seems to be the best tool out there to do the job, to assess vulnerabilities and enable companies, especially our customers who deployed it, to successfully utilize it to uncover vulnerabilities and triage them most rapidly. So we're very pleased by it. In terms of long-term opportunity, we certainly see this as a $100 million opportunity type business over a few year span. And that's what we felt the last couple of quarters, and we feel the same as we see the current trajectory. Any sense of timing on when it could start to approach some of the other attach rates? Well, the attach rate will grow over time. I gave you sort of the few year projection as to where we think it's going to be. And that attach rate will reflect growth through that period and beyond. Very good. Thank you. Our next question comes from Koji Ikeda with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Thank you. Hey, Rick and Kevin, I just wanted to kind of come back to the -- really the elongated sales cycles comments here. We really appreciate the prior commentary on June and how it's been trending since in July. But I really kind of wanted to hit on April and May. Was there any sort of early indications or maybe cracks in the sales cycles or comments that you're hearing from the sales teams that was kind of pointing to potentially elongating sales cycle there or was it really just pronounced in the last two weeks of June? No, it was an interesting time period. Obviously, we're very well instrumented across the organizations in terms of pipeline, deal coverage, and have a pretty thorough process for covering all that. April and May, we're trending extremely well in terms of linearity of bookings, so they were ahead of historical trend.
Pipeline coverage was excellent. So it was a little bit of a surprise when we went through the last two weeks quarter to see that certainly those new logo numbers come off when over the prior 10 weeks of the quarter, things seem very healthy. So, definitely a slowdown in the last two weeks, which is something that we're expecting to continue for the balance of the year. And then we'll see how long these macro pressures remain. And Koji, if I could just add to the answer from Kevin. It took the form, for example, of additional layers of approval in late June that we thought that the CIO would be sufficient to sign the deal. That's what had been communicated. And even in some of these cases, the CIOs would tell us, GSA require more levels of approval, which forced the deals into a later quarter.
Just to be clear and also to address some prior questions, we do not view these as deals lost. In fact, we didn't identify any of these as lost to competitors. So, in the vast majority of these cases, they were deals to continue in pipeline and that we're continuing to work through the course of the quarter. Got it. Thanks guys. I'll hop into the queue. Thank you so much. Thanks Koji. Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Perfect. Thank you. I've got two quick ones. Actually, related to this one, if you think about these new deals and the extra levels of approval, Rick, does that become like a sales execution thing? Because like you basically -- obviously at the beginning of these kind of turmoil, you get surprised because you're not aware of these extra layers that are needed. But then once you kind of bake that into the sales process -- the sales execution process, you kind of think you kind of have it more covered. Is that something that could happen as we go through this? That obviously, everyone got caught out in the last week of June. But now you know that that's required. So, did you -- are you reacting in terms of the sales process, et cetera? That's my first question.
And the second question is on logging. Obviously, really excited to hear that. The one thing is, what makes it so special for you? Because if I look into the market, there's been only like two super successful log vendors out there because it's quite a technical problem actually. What makes you so confident that you kind of crack it here and will be like a preferred guy in that space? Thank you. Great. I'll take both of them. So, first, on sales process, Raimo, great observation. Absolutely, you can imagine that we are doing much more thorough inspection and evaluation of deals in terms of what it takes to get these closed, asking incremental questions of our champions within customers to evaluate what that close cycle looks like, specifically what it's going to take to get the paperwork done.
So, we have reacted and reacted quickly to an updated environment requiring that additional approval cycle. So, very aggressive. Yes, to the answer to the first question to say, we are all over it from a sales execution standpoint of further a deal review as we go through the process.
Second, with regard to logging. What I would say as special are several elements. The first is, we believe that based on hypergraph technology that we're putting into place here that we've seen in the lab so far, that, as I said earlier, we can deliver a highly performing, very scalable solution at lower cost that has no data rehydration requirement.
So, no distinction between cold and warm storage. So, we believe that just on its own, our logging capabilities is very compelling in the market. But what we really believe is most compelling about the logging solution is its fundamental integration into our end-to-end observability platform. That's what makes it most differentiated.
And the reason is because we simply don't see logs as a uniquely independent data set. It really is part of logs, traces, metrics, behavioral analytics, metadata, digital experience or real user data. And it is the application of all of that data to our AIOps engine that really enables us to deliver the answers and intelligent automation from data that we see.
So that's -- we differentiate on the logging solution alone. But really, when you integrate it into the end-to-end observability platform, that's where you get the biggest bang for the buck. Great. Perfect. Thank you. Our next question comes from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Hello. Thank you very much. Extremely clear analysis of the quarter, and also, your take on how you constructed the guidance, so really well done, guys. A question for you, Rick, you've been through a couple of downturns before. And I'm curious to get your take on, what are customers saying? The new logos that you still have on the table, what are they saying as to what they are looking for in order to proceed with these contracts?
And what is your best prediction on what kind of a recovery we are expecting? Is it like a U-shaped recovery, or is it a much elongated recovery? Because maybe your customers are more concerned about certain other things happening with respect to the economy, that they're not quite sure. But what's your best prediction as to how we come out of this and the shape of the recovery? Thank you so much once again. Thanks, Kash. Early morning for you. Thanks for joining. So on the customer front, what they’re telling us in terms of our champions in our various different companies that we're speaking to is that, they want to proceed with the solution. They need some additional levels of approval. And they're going about trying to get those levels of approval as we speak.
So the deals are very much alive, and we're still working through the system. It's just going to take a little bit longer than perhaps it used to in a different environment. So our customers, namely our champions, are so very much of the mindset of continuing to drive these opportunities with us.
With respect to a recovery, gosh, I don't know how to predict that. I don't have a strong stance on it. Obviously, you've got a macro environment which has 40-year inflation highs, interest rates growing at 0.75%, two times in a row now, in June and July. We've got geopolitical challenges, both in the Ukraine, and now assuming even over the past couple of days to accelerate in China, which are creating additional challenge in the market, as you know.
So I don't know is the short answer, to what that recovery is. And I'm not going to take a take a position on it, other than to say that our guidance reflects an ongoing environment that we saw at the end of June and into July through the balance of our fiscal year, and that's how we factored it in. If we see a more rapid recovery than that of the economic environment, then we should benefit from that. As a follow-up -- Rick, thank you so much -- how are you evolving your sales cycles? And what is the new flavor to ensure that you do get your fair share of new customers to sign on? Because there's an opportunity here, right? Curious how the playbook changes. Yes. In terms of the sales playbook, in pipeline generation, which is a core area of focus for us, we're focused in three areas in particular. One that I've spoken of in detail in the past is around partners, talked about Deloitte, for example, last quarter as a global system integrator.
We continue to work with the hyperscalers on the global system integrator front with Deloitte specifically. I'm delighted to report that we have closed already our first contract deal with them, or I should say, through them, a couple of million dollar total contract value deal at Canada. So I'm pleased with that. We've got several dozen customers or opportunities in the pipeline with them. And they've trained almost now a dozen individuals on sales and partner enablement. So we feel good about that.
We do expect, as I indicated in my comments, to have additional system integrator announcements to come. I'm pleased about that. So partners is one category. Another category is through our sales development reps and then through our account executives, with both of those additional channels being also core focal areas for pipeline investment and development. Wonderful. Thank you so much. Our next question comes from Keith Bachman with PMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with that. Time, I'll ask my questions concurrently. The first, if you could update us on your thinking on M&A. There was some controversy, a couple of quarters on kind of what the message is. Now can we prices -- for public assets have fallen materially. Privates perhaps not as -- haven't followed the same trend line, but even privates are feeling some pressure. How do you think about M&A? And particularly, how do you balance the issues surrounding integration of assets, particularly on the technical side versus the opportunity to accelerate growth?
And my second question, a little bit off of cash but perhaps in a different direction is, if the macro continues to slow, because you mentioned that your guidance is based on a steady state from the last two weeks of June through August. But let's say, the macro, and therefore, the pressure on your top line continues to slow, will you further moderate hiring to try to preserve some margin? We had noticed that you had slowed hiring in the last six weeks. So just wondering, if things get worse, so to speak, is your plan to subsequently slow again, or will you just keep hiring and negatively impact the margin? That's it for me. Thank you. Thanks, Keith. To address the M&A one, no change in stance over the last couple of quarters. As we've communicated, we continue to look at M&A in terms of tuck-in opportunities for acceleration of R&D road maps. If we can accelerate our R&D road map by 12 to 18 months, then that's definitely worth us looking at.
Having said that, we are very disciplined buyers, and we're not going to overpay for assets. So we're going to be very careful about that. We are not looking at transformational M&A. So that is not something that is on the table and scope. So it's very much tuck-in in orientation. We do continue to evaluate those types of opportunities.
With respect to the overall macro environment hiring, it is our commitment, as we've stated repeatedly, to manage top line to bottom line. We run a balanced business, with focus on profitability and operating margin. As you see, we maintained constant in our guidance at prior guidance rates, in the 22.5% to 23%. We did that by reducing the hiring ramp, even though we are recruiting quite significantly, as we indicated, 800 people this year as a target. And we will continue to manage variable expenses in order to manage to that operating margin target that we have. So if necessary, based on further top line adjustment, it is our commitment to continue to manage to the operating margins that we've indicated. Perfect. Many thanks. Our last question comes from Joel Fishbein with Truist. Please proceed with your question. Thanks for squeezing me in. You guys have talked `about doubling down on the government go-to-market. I'm just curious about your expectations with regard to the public sector throughout the remainder of the year. That would be helpful. Thank you. A good input and question, Joe. Thanks very much. I was actually down in Virginia and D.C. recently with our federal team. I think that, that is -- it remains to be a significant opportunity in agencies from classified to civilian. And I am very optimistic about our opportunity to grow that business faster than our average ARR growth rate over the course of time. So, I feel very good about the federal situation in particular. Thank you. Okay. I think that brings us to a close. I want to thank you all very much for joining. Just to summarize, we view Q1 as a very solid start to fiscal 2023 in spite of some interesting macro headwinds that appeared late in June, and that continue to persist, and we're managing through. We remain absolutely confident and convicted in our market opportunity. We are seeing resiliency in our enterprise customer base. And we certainly aspire to maintain the ongoing durability of our business model.
We are committed to running this business in a balanced way, with strong profitability and free cash flow. Kevin and I also will be participating in several investor conferences this quarter. So, we look forward to seeing many of you there. Thank you very much for your ongoing support, and have a good day. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]
Please note, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I will now turn the conference over to Noelle Faris, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Faris, you may now begin. Thanks, Operator. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining Dynatrace’s second quarter fiscal 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me on today’s call are Rick McConnell, Chief Executive Officer; and Kevin Burns, Chief Financial Officer.
Before we get started, please note that today’s comments include forward-looking statements, such as statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties depending on a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.
Additional information concerning these uncertainties and risk factors is contained in Dynatrace’s filing with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.
The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company’s view on November 2, 2022. Dynatrace disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances.
As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial measures during today’s call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP measures can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.
Unless otherwise noted, the growth rate we discuss today are non-GAAP, reflecting constant currency growth. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP measures, please refer to today’s earnings press release and financial presentation under the Events section of our website.
And with that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Rick McConnell. Rick? Thanks, Noelle, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today’s call. Dynatrace’s Q2 results solidly beat expectations on the top and bottomline. In particular, adjusted ARR in the second quarter was 33% year-over-year. Subscription revenue came in at $261 million, an increase of 29% year-over-year in constant currency. Non-GAAP operating income was $73 million or 26% of revenue. And on a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow margin was 29%.
These results once again highlight our ability to run a balanced business that delivers compelling topline growth coupled with strong bottomline performance, and they are a testament to the strength of our market, the significant value of our platform and the ongoing durability of our business model.
In addition, I am excited to highlight the launch and release last month of what we believe will prove to be a market-changing product innovation with the launch and release of Grail. Kevin will share more details about our Q2 performance and guidance in a moment.
In the meantime, I’d like to share my view of the current market environment and long-term demand trends, our platform leadership, including further comments on Grail and our intended operational approach for the remainder of the fiscal year.
Beginning with market opportunity, digital transformation remains one of the most durable areas of investment for enterprises. This has driven a sustained need for more sophisticated observability and application security solutions to successfully navigate the resulting complexity and enormous scale of data.
Our customers tell us that such solutions are mission-critical and view them as increasingly mandatory to drive greater operational efficiency, improve customer satisfaction and facilitate commerce.
This market evolution has been a key catalyst to our growth in recent years, and we continue to see very healthy demand and result in pipeline generation across our business. This is a great indicator of the value our customers place on our solutions and of the substantial market opportunity still to come.
We added 164 new logos in Q2 and our net expansion rate was greater than 120% for the 18th straight quarter. We have, however, begun to see additional macro impact, particularly in Europe.
Clearly, enterprises are working to navigate the rapidly changing economic environment that is leading to increased caution in spending and a result lengthening our average close cycle. Consequently, we are bringing down our ARR guidance to reflect increased pressure on new logos and net expansion rates.
As I mentioned, demand generation remains very healthy and our competitive positioning plus win rates remain consistent and strong. Given our pipeline growth, market strength and portfolio evolution, we are highly confident in our ability to reaccelerate ARR growth as economic conditions normalize.
Moreover, our strong enterprise customer base coupled with our recurring subscription revenue model provide us with excellent P&L resiliency even in an uncertain economic environment. As I said last quarter, we are focused on executing well during this period to exit with greater competitive differentiation once the economy improves.
Let me now turn to platform differentiation. Our approach to observability and application security is radically different. Dynatrace does not provide a single product or address a single data type, rather we deliver a comprehensive software intelligence platform that combines the industry’s deepest and broadest multi and hybrid cloud end-to-end observability solution with continuous runtime application security.
It is rapidly becoming impossible for even an army of people in network operation centers to oversee and triage an organization’s entire software ecosystem. By leveraging our AIOps and automation expertise, our solution enables customers to successfully navigate this uncontainable increase in complexity. This is the power of Dynatrace.
Whereas other approaches deliver dashboards, we deliver precise answers and intelligent automation from data. It enables our customers to deliver flawless and secure digital interactions by providing broad-based situational awareness of their cloud ecosystems at all times and it enables them to take action immediately to ensure maximum uptime and performance.
Industry analysts corroborate our leadership position. Last quarter, we announced our position as a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Application Performance Monitoring and Observability for the 12th consecutive time.
In October, ISG released their 2022 Provider Lens for cloud native solutions, which named Dynatrace, a leader with the top overall position in cloud-native observability and a leader in cloud native security. This recognition reflects both our leading position in observability, as well as our strength in its convergence with application security.
Our customers agree, of the 164 new logo customers that we landed in Q2, well over half of them are leveraging three-plus modules. In addition, we saw an increase in the size of our new logos with our trailing 12-month average land growing to $120,000.
The reason customers typically choose Dynatrace is because of our platform strength and I’d like to share just a few examples of Q2 wins. First, one of the world’s largest multinational energy companies made a significant new investment in Dynatrace. With over 4,000 applications across multiple cloud providers, this customer recognized that the scale and complexity of their clouds created a need for a unified observability platform. They selected Dynatrace across the organization and deployed five of our modules. This is also a great example of the power of our partner channel, having leveraged the AWS marketplace with support from our strategic technology partner, DXC.
Second, once customers experience the scale and efficiency of automation and AI, they are eager to expand their relationship with Dynatrace. One such customer is a large financial organization seeking to enhance customer experience, improve operational efficiency and reduce cost by consolidating multiple disparate tools. As a result, the customer made an eight-figure commitment to standardize on Dynatrace. They also identified Dynatrace as a crucial player in their strategic initiative to accelerate cloud migration.
A third example highlights the continued traction of our application security offering with one of the largest global cruise lines. They struggled with prioritizing the hundreds of vulnerabilities they see on any given day. Dynatrace AppSec gave this customer the ability to sift through the noise and help them focus on the vulnerabilities that really matter, saving them time and resources by speeding up their development processes.
These are just a few examples of the trends that are widespread throughout our customer base. We continue to maintain our aggressive focus on innovation as a core differentiator of Dynatrace.
We delivered 24 major releases per year. Our innovation engine is constantly humming, adding functionality to accelerate product leadership. In fact, the vast majority of our R&D team is working on growth and strategic initiatives. AppSec and Grail are great examples of this investment in innovation.
I’d like to take a moment to thank our Founder and CTO, Bernd Greifeneder, along with our product and R&D teams for their immense work over the past few years to bring these groundbreaking technologies to market.
With respect to Grail, you should think of it not as a new module but as an additional core technology in the Dynatrace platform, joining OneAgent, PurePath, Smartscape and Davis. It becomes a key element of our comprehensive end-to-end observability solution and will enable us to capture our $50 billion TAM faster.
Grail is a purpose-built massively parallel processing data lake house that changes the game for data ingest, management and real-time analytics. We see it as a quantum leap forward for Dynatrace’s competitive differentiation and we are extremely excited about the plethora of opportunities it enables.
While there are many salient Grail attributes, here are three areas that differentiate it in the market. First, Grail enables organizations to cost effectively ingest and retain all of their data, while preserving against context across a myriad of data types, including traces, metrics, logs, really user data, et cetera.
Second, Grail leverages the new Dynatrace query language or DQL, to easily build queries for even the most complex use cases that can be run in near real time.
And third, Grail takes advantage of massive hyperscaler compute resources that can scale to thousands of processors operating in parallel on a single query. Our first use case for Grail is log management and analytics, which we continue to see as a market that is ripe for disruption.
While we don’t expect Grail to have a meaningful impact to ARR in FY 2023, we are delighted to see strong early demand with nearly 100 customers lined up for POCs in less than a month of its availability.
One early adopter of Grail is Toyota Financial Services. Before Grail, the team had to decide which log data to keep and store. With Grail, they can get cost effective storage for logs, while retaining context, enabling them to deliver more value and better user experience.
This brings me to my final topic, covering our operating approach over the second half of the fiscal year. I’d like to begin by providing a brief update on partners as a key investment area within our go-to-market strategy, most notably, with global system integrators.
In addition to our formal alliance agreement that we announced with Deloitte, last week, we announced a significant expansion of our relationship with DXC, a leading technology services company.
DXC has been a long time partner of ours and they now plan to embed the Dynatrace platform as the preferred observability solution within its DXC Platform X solution helping their customers optimize and automate their cloud and digital services. In addition, Dynatrace and DXC have agreed to launch a joint global strategic go-to-market program to bring the solution to customers worldwide.
In addition to our commitment to thoughtful and strategic investment in innovation and partnership, we are equally committed to protecting margins. We have adjusted our planned headcount increases and OpEx through the balance of the year to yield an expected increase in our FY 2023 operating margin relative to prior guidance and in alignment with our revised topline model.
Overall, we have proven our discipline in delivering growth in challenging environments, while managing top to bottomline in a balanced way and we plan to continue to execute in this way as we look ahead.
Before I turn the call over to Kevin, I’d like to take a moment to share my thoughts on the CFO transition. I am thrilled to have Jim Benson join Dynatrace as our CFO. Jim is a tremendous financial leader with a proven track record of leading and scaling global finance organizations. Having worked with Jim previously at Akamai, I am confident that he will be a strong partner to me and to the global leadership team.
In addition, I’d like to thank Kevin for his excellent leadership over the past six years and for his dedication to Dynatrace. Having announced his intention back in May to leave Dynatrace by the end of this calendar year, I very much appreciate his commitment to the company through this rigorous search process and to ensuring a seamless transition to Jim.
I want to thank the finance organization and the rest of the Dynatrace team for their engagement in supporting this transition. I continue to be extremely impressed with the strength of this team and I look forward to its next phase of growth.
In closing, Dynatrace is a business that delivers high growth with strong profitability and free cash flow. We delivered a strong second quarter even amidst macro uncertainty and we remain highly confident in the strength of our market opportunity, as well as our platform leadership.
Moreover, we will continue to drive innovation to meet our customer’s evolving needs and further differentiate ourselves in the market. We expect to manage prudently from a financial perspective and we intend to invest thoughtfully in our strategic priorities near-term to emerge from this period in a position of expanded strength.
With that, let me turn the call over to Kevin. Thank you for the kind words, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Before I jump into the business, I want to share that it has been a true pleasure to be part of the team that has helped build Dynatrace over the last six years.
I’d like to thank our Board, John and Rick for providing me the opportunity to be part of this talented team. It has been a truly rewarding experience and a highlight of my career. Equally important, I’d like to thank all the Dynatracers that have so much passion and commitment. It is so rewarding to see such a vibrant community.
Together, we have all built Dynatrace into one of the most successful software businesses. The market opportunity is immense. You are in great hands with Rick and Jim, and I remain confident that Dynatrace will continue to be highly successful.
And now on to our second quarter performance, as Rick mentioned, we delivered a strong second quarter in a fluid environment. We over achieved our internal forecast and guidance across all of our key operating metrics, even as we saw many of the macro trends from last quarter continued to weaken in Q2.
Overall, the resiliency of our subscription model, the strength of our enterprise customer base and solid execution are reflected in our performance. We have a strong business and expect to continue to deliver a balanced performance of growth, profitability and cash flow.
As with previous quarters, I will focus on adjusted ARR growth as it normalizes for currency fluctuations and the wind down of perpetual ARR. Please note that all growth rates will be year-over-year and in constant currency unless otherwise stated.
Dynatrace delivered 33% adjusted ARR growth in the second quarter. ARR for the second quarter was $1.065 billion. Please note that our reported ARR would have been $12 million higher or $1.077 billion when you consider the incremental FX headwinds in the quarter.
Moving on to the building blocks of growth for the business, we added 164 new logos in the second quarter, in line with our expectations, but certainly an area of our business that continues to be impacted by economic headwinds.
As Rick mentioned, the average ARR for new logo lands was $120,000 on a trailing 12-month basis, compared to $114,000 last quarter. In the second quarter, and once again, while over half of our new logos landed with three or more modules representing the movement to the observability platform.
The value of the Dynatrace platform continues to resonate with prospects as they look to deliver rapid operational efficiencies in a tight budget environment. Dynatrace’s ability to rapidly drive greater automation and efficiency that deliver strong ROI and places us near the top of the strategic IT investment list.
Our net expansion rate for the second quarter was once again above 120%. Gross retention rates have been consistently trending up for the last two years. From an existing customer standpoint, we continue to see strength in multi-module adoptions, with 55% of our customers now using three-plus modules at an average ARR of nearly $500,000 per customer.
Overall, we are pleased with the resiliency of our enterprise customers that delivered a strong second quarter performance even in a challenging environment. Our existing customers view us as an essential part of their ecosystem, given the proven value, operating efficiencies and insights that we deliver.
Moving on to revenue. Total revenue for the second quarter was $279 million, up 30% year-over-year and subscription revenue for the second quarter was $261 million up 29%.
With respect to margins, non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter was 83%, down 2 percentage points from Q2 of last year. This reduction was primarily driven by investments in our partner strategy that showed up as services cost of goods and customer success initiatives as we expand broader coverage.
As we have said before, we have a very healthy margin profile, reflecting the value and efficiency of the Dynatrace platform and I do anticipate gross margins stepping up in the back half of 2023.
Investments and innovation in select go-to-market initiatives remain top priorities for us. For the second quarter, we invested $41 million in R&D or 15% of revenue. We continue to drive successful product innovation, and as Rick noted, our recent launch of Grail is a great example of our steadfast commitment to ongoing market leadership.
On the go-to-market side, we invested $90 million in sales and marketing this quarter or 32% of revenue, prioritizing investments in direct sales and our expanding partner strategy. We grew our sales rep headcount by about 25% year-over-year, which will be down from our original goal of 30% growth as we pull back slightly as we have sufficient capacity given today’s environment.
Our non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $73 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 26%, exceeding the top end of the guidance range by 250 basis points due to the revenue upside, combined with a disciplined investment strategy. On the bottomline, non-GAAP net income was $64 million or $0.22 per share, $0.03 above the high end of our guidance range.
Looking at the balance sheet, as of September 30th, we had $563 million of cash, an increase of $193 million compared to the same period last year and inclusive of $120 million of debt repayments on a trailing 12-month basis.
Our free cash flow was $25 million, compared to $14 million in the same period last year. Due to seasonality in billings, we believe it is best to view free cash flow over a 12-month period. On a trailing 12-month basis, our free cash flow was $300 million or 29% of revenue. We are extremely pleased with our continued healthy cash generation and we have not yet needed to modify customer payment terms due to macro issues.
The last financial measure that I would like to discuss this morning is our remaining performance obligation. RPO was approximately $1.53 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of 29% over Q2 of last year. The current portion of RPO, which we expect to recognize as revenue over the next four quarters was $878 million, an increase of 29% year-over-year.
We are very pleased with the RPO growth, and it’s important to remember that seasonality associated with bookings and contract modifications will cause variability in the RPO growth rates. When combined, these strong Q2 results demonstrate the durability of our business model that supports a strong balance of growth and profitability.
Now let me turn to guidance. Our pipeline and demand generation remains very healthy and our competitive positioning and win rates remain strong. However, the macro conditions continue to generally weaken and we think this is even more prevalent in Europe.
As a result, we now expect close rates in the back half to be lower than what we experienced in the first half of fiscal 2023. Therefore, we will be reducing ARR constant currency guidance by $30 million and we believe this will primarily impact ARR towards the end of the fiscal year.
In light of this increased pressure on ARR, we are moderating some investments in order to increase operating margin and to continue to drive a balanced business.
So let me walk you through some of the key assumptions on sightsee what is included in our updated guidance. First, as I mentioned, new logos continues to be an area of the business that is most impacted by the weakening of the economy. Given that, we now expect new logo additions in fiscal 2023 to be down roughly 5% over last year, reflecting tighter budget scrutiny and elongated sales cycles.
From a headcount standpoint, we had a strong first half for hiring and have a talented team in place to execute against our strategic goals. This provides us flexibility to moderate the pace of hiring in the back half of the year, while still maintaining healthy growth in headcount on a year-over-year basis.
Third, with more than 40% of our business denominated in foreign currency, the continued strength of the USD creates a sizable headwind. We now expect full year constant currency impact to be approximately $60 million on ARR and revenue. This represents an incremental headwind of approximately $20 million to ARR and $12 million to revenue for the full year compared to our prior guidance.
And finally, consistent with prior guidance, the perpetual license wind down for fiscal 2023 is expected to be approximately $8 million or 80 basis points. The headwind in Q3 will be approximately 1 percentage point.
With that in mind, let’s start with our guidance for the full year, again, with growth rates in constant currency. We expect ARR to be between $1.164 billion and $1.172 billion, representing an adjusted ARR growth of 24%. From a constant currency standpoint, this represents a $30 million or 300-basis-point decline from prior guidance, driven by the factors I outlined above.
In terms of ARR seasonality, we expect that net new ARR is going to be $120 million in the back half of 2023, split roughly evenly between Q3 and Q4 to reflect further conservatism in guidance.
Given some strength in Q2 revenue and the fact that we think the ARR reduction is back-end loaded, we are raising the midpoint of our prior revenue guidance by 50 basis points. We expect total revenue to be between $1.190 billion and $1.126 billion and subscription revenue to be between $1.047 billion to $1.052 billion, both of which result in 27% year-over-year growth.
From a profit standpoint, we remain committed to offsetting incremental headwinds with operational efficiencies and appropriate investment management. With that in mind, we are raising our non-GAAP operating margin guidance to 24.5%, representing a 175-basis-point increase from the midpoint of our prior guidance. We believe this will still enable us to support additional investments in R&D and sales and marketing.
We are raising non-GAAP EPS by $0.07 per share to $0.81 per share to $0.83 per share based on 292 million diluted shares to 293 million diluted shares and a non-GAAP effective cash tax rate of 11%.
And finally, we are maintaining our free cash flow margin guidance of 27.5% to 28.5% of revenue. In terms of dollars, we expect free cash flow to be between $308 million and $321 million.
Looking at Q3, we expect total revenue to be between $283 million and $286 million or 24% to 25% growth. Subscription revenue is expected to be between $266.5 million and $268.5 million, up 24% to 25% year-over-year.
From a profit standpoint, non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $71.5 million and $73.5 million, 25.5% of revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $0.21 per share to $0.22 per share.
In summary, our second quarter fiscal 2023 results demonstrated strong performance amidst increasing macro headwinds. It’s a challenging environment and the durability of our business model is purpose built to navigate these transitory market conditions. We are being mindful of our investments and we will continue to prioritize strategically in innovation and go-to-market.
Our strong financials, subscription business model and healthy enterprise customer base, combined with a world-class people organization, continue to position us for resilient and predictable growth and profitability as we move forward.
And with that, we will open the line for questions. Operator? Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first one question is from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess either for Rick or Kevin, Q2 was a really nice quarter and a really tough tape. And kind of looking at, Kevin, your new ARR assumptions, I think, for my math, it looks like it’s down about 27% in the second half, that’s versus up about 13%, the first half and I guess the question that we are getting from a lot of folks are, sort of your level of confidence that this will be the last cut. And so maybe I know you gave some of the underlying assumptions, but maybe ARR assumptions or anything else that can kind of get us helpful with what looks like a significant level of conservatism. Sure. No. Thanks, Matt. Good to connect. We were certain -- as you mentioned, we were certainly pleased with the performance in the quarter and it came in ahead of expectations internally and obviously externally as well. So we are pleased with that performance.
When we thought about the back half, though, as you -- I am sure you can imagine, we went back and looked at the pipeline and coverage and how the geographies were performing and also the economic conditions in the regions. And we just continue to see additional pressure and we are expecting additional pressure coming out of the European area.
So generally the reduction is primarily focused in the European part of the world. That will be a little bit of new logos, as we talked, new logos will be down 5% year-over-year against generally most of that will be coming out of Europe and there will be some pressure, obviously, on the net expansion rate. We did reduce bookings by -- ARR by $30 million, and obviously, that will have some pressure on the net expansion rate.
We do believe, though, Matt, that we -- as we said in the call, it’s -- we put this as a back-end loaded adjustment and I think that’s indicative of what we thought guide from a revenue standpoint where we actually slightly increased our revenue guidance.
So back-end loaded, trying to be very -- trying to be cautious. We did -- we reset once. Unfortunately, we had to do it again. Unfortunately, we want to be very conservative just going into Q3 and Q4. We are very bullish on the business. We are optimistic, but we need to balance it with setting expectations that we will deliver on into Q3 and Q4. Yeah. Let me just add quickly, Matt… Sure. … and thanks for the question. First of all, we are very confident overall in this business. Pipeline is growing. That is a great sign. The challenge is some purchasing decisions are getting deferred, as Kevin said, particularly in Europe and that’s elongating some sales cycles. So we wanted to de-risk the model as we look to the second half and that’s what we sought to do.
Overall health of the business, very strong, great about the overall product leadership and evolution, which I talked about and that’s how we are going to manage the business in the second half. That’s super helpful, guys. And then, Rick, maybe just one for you on Grail, obviously, a lot of exciting things to think about there for the future, 100 customers on a POC, eventually, when that starts to hit your ARR. I mean, how do you expect that to sort of benefit? Is it just even more -- maybe just the monetization of, I guess, is the question, eventually when it comes in, I know it’s still early here, but how should we think about that eventually maybe as a fiscal 2024 driver? Well, as I said, Matt, we believe that the log management and analytics market is very right for disruption. We believe we have a very, very unique opportunity to take advantage of that given the technological framework that we have constructed and we are thrilled with the early demand and interest from customers.
We saw this in our customer innovate sections, which we executed globally in Singapore, Sao Paulo and London over the prior month to six weeks, getting first-hand feedback from customers here. So we feel very good about it.
We still believe what we said a quarter ago, which is that as with infrastructure, we think that log management and analytics can add $100 million or so of ARR over an eight-quarter span or thereabouts. So that’s what we are still expecting following launch. Thanks, guys. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question. Yeah. Thanks. So, first, Kevin, congratulations. Thank you for all the hard work and good luck with all the future endeavors. And then in terms of question, I wanted to drill in on the existing customers. We saw a notable slowdown out of the hyperscalers. How did you factor that into your ARR and what gives you the confidence that, that’s the right level in terms of the full year guide? So, thank you, Sterling. It’s been great working with you. So I always appreciate the great covering and great questions and insights you have in the business as well. So I appreciate that. Thank you.
With respect to our ARR guidance how we thought about the hyperscalers, it was absolutely part of the equation. I will say that our hyperscaler component of our business continues to grow nicely. So we didn’t see a dramatic of a slowdown that they did some of them printed publicly. So we are pleased about that.
And I’d say the other thing that we are super excited about again more over the next couple of quarters as opposed to the near term, but is the GSI partnerships that we are developing, right, the one that we have with Deloitte, the one that we just announced DXC, other ones in process that we will hopefully talk about in the near future as well.
So we definitely took some adjustments from hyperscaler slowdown. We are pleased with the performance internally. We do also think there’s another tailwind on the GSI. So I am not trying to walk up our guidance and get too excited about it, but definitely some tailwinds there that we adjusted down, but we think there’s some tailwinds that we are seeing today. The only thing I would add, Sterling, is that, we obviously have a huge market opportunity with the installed base of hyperscalers already. It is obviously well, well over $100 billion in revenue and we believe that as observability becomes more commonplace, becomes more standard in cloud deployments, especially for enterprise customers, that there is a lot of opportunity to penetrate that installed base, and obviously, the growth rate continues to be strong, even though down over the prior quarter for the hyperscalers. Understood. Thank you, guys. Thanks. Thanks, Sterling. Our next question is from the line of Kamil Mielczarek with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. Hey. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to better understand the linearity of demand. As the quarter progressed, when did you see the largest deterioration in sales and how did that change in the first few weeks of the December quarter? So in Q2, Kamil, our business performed as expected, if not slightly as we mentioned, it performed slightly better. So we definitely reached our expectations a little bit in terms of linearity and linearity came in line -- performance came in line with expectations for the quarter. So, pleased about that.
When we look into Q3, when we look into Q4, our approach is just to be more cautious, right? It -- the economy seems to be getting tougher, deal cycles are -- we believe will continue to elongate. As Rick said, we have great pipeline coverage, our win rates are great, but the close rates, we just expect them to slow down in Q3 and Q4, and that’s really what’s driving.
So those are the -- it’s really a close rate assumption is sort of how we are thinking about adjusting our guidance. Top funnel, all those metrics, win rates are doing great, but we just wanted to be a little bit more cautious as we fill into the back half of the fiscal year. That’s helpful. And if I could just follow up, Kevin -- and Kevin called out a slight slowdown in the pace of sales rep hiring, can you update us on your hiring targets for fiscal 2023 for the business as a whole and what has hiring look like to-date? So, ballpark we are at 25% for total company midpoint through the year, which is great. I’d say we are definitely a little -- slightly a little bit higher on the innovation sort of R&D and sales and marketing side, and our sales headcount growth, as I mentioned, we did about 25% growth there.
So we did a great job in the first half of getting great talent on the Board. Our retention is very high as well, which is great. I think that can also help our sales capacity, as we go we will have better and more mature revenue. So that’s where we are at midpoint of the year.
We will continue to grow R&D and sales 20% plus in that range. We will see how the good quarters play out here over the next six months and then we will slow some other things down generally. So I think the punch line is, I think, fiscal year ending headcount will probably be around 20% growth with it a little bit higher in the innovation and go-to-market. Got it. Appreciate the color and thanks again. Our next question is from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Hey. Thank you. So the -- Kevin let review, if you look at the -- how other companies or how we kind of think about the scenario, like, close rate is usually the one that the CFO is driving in terms of the, like, I -- everything is kind of seems to be working, but like close rate as kind of where kind of put the final stop one. If you look about your pipeline and you said the pipeline coverage is totally fine. If you think about like deal sizes in the pipeline and also how they track through the pipeline, have you seen a change there or is that all still like what you have seen before, but like the final step of the close rate is where you kind of want to be more conservative? And then I have one follow-up for Rick. Yeah. It really -- Raimo, it really is -- it’s close rate. That’s what we have looked at, and of course, there’s some moving parts here and there. But the fundamental change in the business is elongating cycles, which means our close rate are just aren’t what they were historically. So that’s what we see, and again, as we mentioned, it’s more pronounced over in the European region. Raimo, the only thing I would add to that is that, while that’s true on close rates, it is important to understand that we expect close rates to renormalize. There’s nothing that we have seen to suggest that as the macro environment improves, although we are not predicting exactly when that is, but as the macro environment improves, we expect those close rates to renormalize. And the good news is… Yeah. … with ongoing growth in pipeline and no change in win rates, we think that that’s a very productive long-range scenario. Okay. Yeah. Makes sense. And then one question on Grail, like, if you think about -- you mentioned earlier that it’s not just a number tool. It’s like slightly more fundamental. Like how do we have to think about your positioning of Grail and your other products in the market, like, is Grail becoming like the platform that everything builds out, is it the underlying analytics platform, like, how do you think about, like, why think about Dynatrace and how they are positioning -- how you guys positioning your product like in a year or two, like, how does it all fit together, could you just speak to that a little bit? Thank you. Sure. Grail, as I mentioned, Raimo, is a core technology, just like OneAgent, PurePath, Smartscape, et cetera, for us. It is, as I said, massively parallel processing data lake house that gives us incredible performance at exceptional scale and also an ability to do that in a very cost-effective way. So that’s how we sort of look at Grail. The first instantiation of it is log management and analytics, and that’s how we will initially deploy Grail.
So that’s sort of our overall perspective on how we take advantage of this market opportunity and leverage Grail going forward. It is a solution that doesn’t do reindexing, doesn’t do rehydration and uses graphing technology to provide very complex analytics on logs in near real-time and that is a very, very unique position in the market. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. The next question is from the line of Mike Cikos with Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions here. The first question I wanted to ask about was around the adjusted ARR guide. I know that we have this -- you are calling out from Europe and you have cited as pressures we are expecting in the second half of the year on both new logos and the expansions. So, first, happy to have the color regarding that 5% year-to-year decline we expect the new logos for fiscal 2023. Regarding the net expansions, we should be thinking about that playing out over the remainder of the year? Is there a potential for that to actually dip below that 120% plus you guys have been posting on a consistent basis? Mike, it’s Kevin. So, yes, unfortunately, based on our guidance, there’s -- mathematically, the net expansion rate in the fourth quarter would fall below 120%. Again, that’s based on what we have currently guided.
We also highlighted in our -- in the prepared remarks that our net expansion rate remains very healthy. Certainly in the second quarter, it was very healthy. Our third quarter is always a very big quarter from us going back to our customer base and expansion in our customer base. So we are optimistic about that and it’s still early on Q4.
But so, again, we wanted to de-risk the number in Q4. Mathematically, net expansion rate could drop below Q4 for a period of time. As Rick said, though, we think these are just transitory items in the business and long-term net expansion rate will certainly rebound north of 120%, assuming we come in around where the guidance is.
But I don’t want to walk numbers something again, but we are very bullish about the ability to continue to sell on our customer base. Average ARR is still around $300,000, significant opportunity. With Grail coming on board, that will be another boost in FY 2024 as well. So, again, we definitely believe there’s a lot of tailwinds to that number and if it does drop below 120%, we think that will be shortly. Thank you. That’s very helpful with the color there. And if I could just tack on one more follow-up, it’s really around the sales cycle elongation that we are calling out today. And I just wanted to make sure I was clear, can you give a rough order of magnitude for the delta that we are seeing, like, are these push outs weeks, are we more in the neighborhood of months? And then the follow-up question, just given how you guys are describing Europe, I think, it’s probably fair to characterize the Europe pressure is being more pervasive in nature. So first is volume of pressure in Europe, a fair characterization? And then second, is any of that weakness spilling over to other geographic regions that you guys participate in? Well, the -- Mike, the weakness in macro environment is clearly global, but more pronounced in Europe, which is what we are calling out. So that’s point number one. And with regard to the overall sales cycles, we look at it mostly in terms of quarters, but the vast, vast majority of any deals that pushed out due to lengthening close cycle last quarter we expect to close this quarter. And as I said, no change in win loss ratio, so we feel good about the prospects as we look into the quarter associated with those close rates. Thank you very much, guys. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Okay. Thank you. I want to start with a question on the close rates and the operating margin expansion. So I appreciate your focus on profitability and expanding that margin. But do you think maybe the slowdown in hiring, do you think that could possibly extend this period of lower close rates or are those close rates really independent of the sales capacity that you have? No. I think that’s right. I think they are independent, Andrew, and I think they are independent for two reasons. One is, as I mentioned, we grew the sales organization 25%. The other thing that’s happening in that organization is the tenures increase, right?
And I think you have talked about this clearly before, as you have more mature reps, their productivity is much higher as well. So we do believe 25% headcount growth in the sales organization with increasing maturity, low attrition rates sets us up to reaccelerate when macroeconomic conditions rebound.
And then the other piece that can be additive over time, which I think Rick and the organization have done a great job is the partner channel, right? I think we are doing well with the hyperscalers. I think we are doing and the opportunity is perhaps even larger with the GSIs and we talked about that in the prepared remarks in terms of what we have done, including the recent DXC announcements, the Deloitte partnership and more to come there as well. So, overall, I think that gives us a lot of capacity to reaccelerate the business as we move forward when conditions rebound. Okay. That’s great. Thank you. And then I wanted to ask a follow-up question on Grail. You noted that it’s more than just a new module. So I am wondering, is this -- is Grail targeted at new customers to replace their legacy data warehouse solutions in their data lakes or will this be more of an add-on sale initially targeted at existing customers? Just wondering where do you think you will see that initial traction with Grail. Well, the lowest hanging fruit is in clearly our installed base where our customers trust Dynatrace already. They have strong and healthy net expansion. They are used to adding modules.
We have more than 50% of our customers now on three-plus modules, and in fact, new logos are closing with more than three-plus modules at greater than 50% as well. So it is a cross-platform sell, a cross-platform play and Grail fits nicely into that.
But having said that, we also have experienced and seen interesting and significant demand even out the chute from new customers that are interested and candidly moving away from their existing log management and analytics solution. Got it. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Koji Ikeda with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I had a question on sales capacity. You had comments on investing for the future, potential ARR growth reacceleration, lots of commentary on the pipeline and how it continues to build, but really balanced against the current environment affects the close rate. So the question here is really what are you looking for around the end market, maybe signal a pickup again in sales hiring, so the capacity is ramping ahead of a demand curve versus potentially trying to catch up to demand? I think, hi, Koji. I think the leading indicator is that we will continue to monitor. We will be top of funnel, right, and then we are going to be looking at close rates and win rates and conversion rates as well. So once we start to see those move in, that’s when I think we would probably step into a little bit more sales capacity investments.
But again, please keep in mind based on what I just said, we think we have a lot of capacity in the organization. Obviously, there -- if the productivity flow in the environment, so we think this organization that we have and where they are going to be in six months, 12 months, will give a lot of capacity to reaccelerate the business. So we think -- we generally think, Koji, that we are in a good spot with the sales organization and the partner organization at this point and we will add a headcount as we see the demand... Got it. Thanks. And then maybe just a quick follow-up for Kevin. In your prepared remarks, you did mention that you aren’t seeing any payment term changes right now. But thinking about the guide, are there any assumptions for more flexible payment terms incorporated within the guidance? Thanks, guys. There are not. Like, we -- I added that in. We added that in just to give folks comfort that the enterprise customer base that we are working with. When they decide to move forward on projects, generally, they are not negotiating payment terms, obviously, that would see to tend to focus on the discount.
So we are good there. We have pretty good visibility into the cash flow over the next six months as well. So we didn’t take anything in. We don’t see it meaningful. Even during COVID, the impact was de minimis. So I don’t expect that would move the needle on the fiscal year guidance. Got it. Thanks so much, guys. Thank you. The next question is from the line of Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Okay. Thanks. Good morning. Rick, I just wanted to start with kind of the story for the stock. You previously considered this fiscal year, fiscal 2023 to be more of an investment year where margins would be in the low 20% range and then they would re-accrete to the mid-20% range in fiscal 2024, alongside new product releases, so we thought growth would potentially accelerate and a lot to think about for fiscal 2024. Today, obviously, the environment has changed. You are increasing your profitability outlook and now in the mid-20% range here today. I am wondering how we can think about this story from here. I am wondering if this means fiscal 2024 becomes more of an investment, some of these investme6nts are now spread over multiple years as some of those initiatives are understandably pushed out and how you would kind of reset telling the growth and margin story from here, if that makes sense? Yes. Hi, Adam. So a few things, few quarters ago, we did want to make some incremental investments in certain areas. We have made those investments in Grail, in partners, in SDRs, for example. Those have enabled us to expand the business through this period of time and set ourselves up for the long term.
We have additionally operated in the mid-20s operating margin and that’s what we expect to do going forward. So that’s where we are resetting the boundary to an operating margin at this stage. So we have taken it up by 175 basis points at the midpoint and that’s where we expect to be able to operate as we look ahead. Okay. Got it. And then maybe just as a follow-up on the question, why is this last cut as I think about potential risk factors from here and please add any that you are thinking about, but EMEA is the region that you are seeing a lot of the challenges. I am wondering how currency impacts demand in that region? I think you do have some U.S. dollar pricing. And I am wondering, as I think about potential pressure from here, the need to reduce pricing in that region to match the purchasing power of the customer, particularly relevant as I am sure you have a bunch of renewals coming up this coming quarter. Just wondering how you are thinking about pricing and currency as it relates to that and any potential deflation to happen in the model. Thank you. To clarify, that was a question for your -- on Europe, I am sorry, I missed the region. Right. FX impact and whether you will potentially need to reduce pricing, which would potentially be a headwind to growth, right? So we operate in Europe. I would say 95% of our business is done in local currency or euro, if not closer to 99%. So our guidance is assuming that the euro remains where it is for the balance of the year. So we don’t expect to see any additional constant currency adjusted ARR guide, assuming currency stay flat.
With respect to pricing and what’s happening there from an end user standpoint, are we -- when we do renewals with our customers, we are actually looking to drive higher price increases, right? I appreciate the economy is tough right now, but the cost of everything is going up and we are trying to pass some of that on to our end users as well.
So, historically, we have done sort of low single-digit price increases. We are trying to realize a higher percent price increase as we move the business forward. We are certainly seeing that from our vendors that we work with and we think that’s the right thing to do through the business. So no specific additional price pressures over in Europe and we are certainly trying to make sure that we increase prices appropriately to maintain margin over there. Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Fatima Boolani with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Rick, one for you and one for Kevin. Rick, I will start with you. Just the commentary on budgetary caution, I can appreciate that’s contributing to sales cycle conversation being protracted. But I am wondering if you can share some nuances as to what these customers are doing in lieu of launching onto the Dynatrace platform? Is it more of sticking to DIY, lower cost open source environment or are they sticking with incumbents? What are some of the granularities in the discussion in terms of the reasons customers are pushing out the conversation? Hi, Fatima. It is absolutely just sticking with what you currently have, typically, DIY. We always say that DIY is our biggest competitor and it is companies that just think I can get by for another quarter or another two quarters, doing what they have been doing with DIY deployments and trying to manage through that without taking advantage of sophisticated AIOps and performing capabilities such as those that Dynatrace delivers. So that’s what’s happening currently. Got it. And Kevin, just for you, with the cost moderation measures that are now clearly in place and you can see it in your comments around the moderating hiring, when should we see some of that dovetail into free cash flow conversion, just curious because you didn’t change the ranges on your free cash flow margin. So how should we think about a delayed impact or seasonal factors that maybe aren’t obvious to us on the free cash flow margin side versus the operating margin upside? Thank you. Sure, Fatima. So, generally, as we mentioned, we took ARR down by about $30 million, which you would think would generally flow through to free cash flow depending on when you build that.
However, that was offset by our slower investments, right, so operating income, operating margins went up to offset, generally the decline in ARR, which is why we were able to maintain the free cash flow conversion rate of margin of 28%.
So we don’t -- nothing is going to happen in FY 2024 that is going to change the trajectory. We are not pulling things in to drive higher cash flow here in 2023. That’s just a normalized run rate based on operating at a 24.5% operating margin. Operator? Thank you. Our final question is coming from the line of Will Power with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Great. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just to start with the follow-up. I know as it pertains to the full year outlook, you are now expecting weaker customer expansion as well on top of some of the new logo pressures. I wonder -- just to be clear, is that something you are already seeing, I guess, as you kind of look through the month of October and if it is something you are seeing and expect? Are there particular workload or use cases where you are expecting some of that customer expansion pressure relative to perhaps prior expectations? It’s not something we are seeing now, but what we have seen, as we have mentioned during the call here is that, it’s a closed rate item at this point, right? And obviously, close rate means that whether it’s an expansion deal or new logo deals, all those things are getting pushed out, which implies that, obviously, your new logo number is going to come down and net expansion rate is going to come down.
We have seen over the last two quarters a slight change, just given that adjusted ARR came down by a percentage point, a very slight change in net expansion rate in Q2. Again, we are optimistic. I don’t want to walk up numbers. We are optimistic that the business continues to perform and remain resilient, but trying to be cautious and conservative, we wanted to bring down that back-end number.
So I -- there’s no trends we are seeing. The only trend we see right now is just close rates are extended in Europe in particular and be implied as new logos and net expansion will come down as a result of that. But as we have tried to communicate this is hopefully short-term temporary and we do believe every customer can need to accelerate both move forward. Okay. And then maybe to sneak one in for Kevin, nice to see the higher margin assumptions for the year, I know you referenced moderating hiring, I know that’s probably a big piece of that, anything else on the higher operating margins to call out that we should be aware of? No. As Rick mentioned, we did make some of the strategic targeted investments in the first half, right? So those will be reduced in Q3 and Q4. So that drives higher margins. And then, I think, generally, as you can see from our P&L, we have been operating at a 25% op income margin.
So it really is generally at this point, headcount and those targeted investments we have made in Q1 and Q2 are coming to conclusion here as well. So those are sort of the two things that we needed to adjust generally. Great. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. At this time, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session and I will turn the call over to Rick McConnell for closing remarks. Well, thank you all for joining this morning’s call. We really do appreciate it. Dynatrace has a very strong business, Q2 was very solid, delivering high growth, profitability, free cash flow. I am extremely bullish in Dynatrace’s market opportunity and our growing product differentiation with solutions such as Grail, as we discussed and absolutely believe in very strong view to the future. We are participating in several conferences this quarter and look forward to speaking with you in the coming weeks and we thank you again for your continued support. This concludes today’s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. At this time, I will now turn the conference over to Noelle Faris, Vice President of Investor Relations. Noelle, you may now begin. Good morning and thank you for joining Dynatrace’s third quarter fiscal 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me on today’s call are Rick McConnell, Chief Executive Officer and Jim Benson, Chief Financial Officer.
Before we get started, please note that today’s comments include forward-looking statements such as statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance and economic conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties depending on a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Additional information concerning these uncertainties and risk factors is contained in Dynatrace’s filing with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company’s view on February 1, 2023. Dynatrace disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances.
As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial measures during today’s call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP measures can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. Unless otherwise noted, the growth rates we discuss today are non-GAAP, reflecting constant currency growth. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP measures, please refer to today’s earnings press release and financial presentation under the Events section of our website.
And with that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Rick McConnell. Rick? Thanks, Noelle and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on today’s call. I am very pleased with the team’s execution this past quarter amidst a difficult macro backdrop. Dynatrace’s strong third quarter results solidly beat expectations on the top and bottom line. Adjusted ARR growth and constant currency subscription revenue growth were both 29% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin in the third quarter was 27% and free cash flow margin on a trailing 12-month basis was also 27% of revenue. These results continue to demonstrate our ability to run a balanced business that delivers high growth, coupled with strong bottom line performance. They are a testament to the strength of our market, the significant customer value of our platform and the ongoing durability of our business model. Jim will share more details about our Q3 performance and guidance in a moment. In the meantime, I’d like to share my view of the current market environment, our platform leadership and differentiation and our investment priorities to support future growth.
To start, our market opportunity has never been stronger. We recently conducted an independent global survey of 1,300 CIOs and senior DevOps managers, 90% of whom indicated the digital transformation within their organization has accelerated in the past 12 months. They also said that their DevOps teams spend on average over 30% of their time on manual tasks involving code quality issues and security vulnerabilities, which reduces the time spent on innovation. These research findings support our perspective that observability is increasingly moving from optional to mandatory.
Digital transformation and in particular, cloud modernization initiatives, continue to grow rapidly. Consequently, the volume of data is exploding as is its complexity, making manual troubleshooting and analytics based on dashboards nearly impossible. Organizations need answers and intelligent automation from data to streamline their processes and maximize employee productivity. They expect Dynatrace to provide deep situational awareness to keep their businesses operating while radically improving their innovation, efficiency and responsiveness. As a result, our solutions are becoming an indispensable part of our customers’ cloud ecosystems.
It is worth noting that the hyperscalers, AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft have started to speak more broadly about an increased focus from customers on cloud optimization as an element of their digital transformation initiatives. This is a trend that directly benefits Dynatrace. Cloud optimization is about ensuring that cloud deployments deliver a compelling ROI. It’s about effectively managing the exploding number of cloud workloads to ensure high availability and resource efficiency. Dynatrace facilitates such optimizations by providing trusted insights based on causal AI-powered analytics and automation to enable substantially higher software liability. This is reflected in our mantra of cloud done right and it is consistent with company’s efforts to work smarter in the cloud.
Our ability to provide insight and visibility drive efficiencies and optimize spending across our customers’ IT ecosystems is unique. Industry analysts consistently agree. As we previously shared, we were selected as a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for APN and Observability as well as the ISG provider lens for cloud-native observability and security. Then in December, Dynatrace received the highest score overall in the Forrester 2022 Wave or AIOps report, topping all other solution providers reviewed. The author later published a blog saying, “the vendor best able to demonstrate a strong and differentiating offering across all 35 capabilities was Dynatrace.” And we continue to invest in our innovation engine to further differentiate ourselves and enhance our leadership position.
So turning to our roadmap for R&D innovation, I’d like to talk next about three focal areas. The first is increased automation, including AIOps, DevOps, DevSecOps and the concept of shift-left. Our customers aspire to deliver a software environment that works perfectly and one with an exceptional user experience. We already enable customers to move away from manual monitoring and dashboarding to automated answers. The next step is to increasingly integrate the Dynatrace platform directly into code to allow proactive automated remediation of issues before they become visible to end users.
The second is real-time data management and analytics with Grail. AIOps and automation are the foundation to manage, process, store and analyze data in real-time. Keeping all data including traces, metrics, logs, real user data, open telemetry, etcetera in context, is mission-critical. This requires us to store and manage petabytes of customer data and it mandates highly efficient analytics against that data in near real-time. With our October launch of rail, our massively parallel processing data lakehouse purpose-built for observability and AppSec use cases, we now have the core technology in place to deliver against this sizeable challenge.
It’s still early yet we are now engaged in over 160 active POCs and a growing community of paying customers for our first use case of log management and analytics. This remains a market that we believe is ripe for disruption through improved performance and scale as well as the deep inclusion of logs with other observability data types in AIOps analyses. We closed several 6-figure deals in the quarter and we only just started.
That leads me to our third R&D focal area, application security. Observability and AppSec are inextricably converging driven by the growing need for organizations to better understand threat and vulnerability activity inside their environments. Customers are looking to operationalize the observability data being generated to understand and assess these threats in real-time in their infrastructure and apps. We added 85 new AppSec customers in the quarter, again, including several 6-figure deals. Our application security offering and Grail are excellent examples of our product team’s ability to anticipate where the market is going and develop solutions that meet customer needs.
Later this month in Las Vegas, we are looking forward to hosting Perform, our first in-person global customer conference since 2020. We plan to share our most comprehensive set of technology and platform announcements to-date, which will set the tone for the year ahead. Investors are invited to attend in-person or tune-in virtually to our main stage presentations. And members of our leadership team will be on hand for a moderated investor Q&A breakout session.
In addition to our relentless commitment to innovation, we also continue to advance our go-to-market efforts. In particular, we have grown our direct sales force by nearly 20% year-over-year, while at the same time, gaining leverage and scale by dramatically increasing our focus and investment in partners, most notably with hyperscalers and global system integrators or GSIs. In addition to the formal alliance agreement between Deloitte and Dynatrace we announced last May, we have expanded our relationship with DXC as well as 8 other strategic GSIs that are striving to help customers digitally transform their businesses and reduce cloud complexity. Our objective is to participate in digital transformation projects earlier in the purchasing cycle and in so doing enable customers to establish more resilient cloud deployments from the start. Strong partnerships are consequently a critical element for us to construct a flywheel momentum in new logo growth as well as expansion in our installed base.
As I mentioned previously, we also continue to enhance our pricing and packaging structure, which we believe will help unlock the full potential of the Dynatrace platform and accelerate expansion. Our installed base has significant growth potential amidst a rapidly growing solution portfolio and we believe a more extensible and simplified licensing model will help us capture that opportunity. Our Dynatrace platform subscription or DPS model is already used by roughly 100 of our largest customers and enables an ARR accretive, frictionless licensing experience through a committed spend with flexible usage across the Dynatrace solution set.
To emphasize the power of these investment priorities and delivering customer value, I’d like to share some recent wins to highlight why organizations choose Dynatrace. We partnered with AWS to land a 7-figure, 3-year deal with a major airline. They are leveraging 6 of our modules, including logs on Grail, having discovered that their existing dashboard tool provided little value on Cyber Monday due to blind spots and unpredictable cloud resource spikes. Now, the customer has insights with root cause analysis across their workloads and can more effectively and proactively solve problems with AI and automation.
We also landed an 8-figure multiyear deal with a large U.S. insurance company that is transitioning to SaaS and leveraging AWS. This company had been dealing with a recurring SevOne issue, impacting tens of thousands of insurance agents. In the past, the company’s application would cease to work multiple times a year for hours at a time, affecting agents, policyholders, IT resources and future customers. The company estimated that the cost for downtime was millions of dollars per year. With Dynatrace, they quickly found the root cause of the highly complex problem, eliminating application downtime, saving teams from additional waste of time and helping increase customer satisfaction. Another customer, a major bank, expanded its existing 7-figure commitment with us, bringing its total annual recurring revenue up to an 8-figure relationship due to Dynatrace’s ability to scale and drive efficiency across its entire technology ecosystem.
And finally, one of the largest European producers of premium and luxury automobiles in charge of multiple car and truck brands signed a 7-figure land deal using DPS licensing, placing Dynatrace as the number one solution for observability within their internal marketplace. With this agreement in place, all their brands can simply sign on or observability with a pre-negotiated rate card without the time consuming negotiations and approval chain. This is a great example of the frictionless expansion opportunity that the DPS model can create for us.
In closing, I am grateful to our customers for their feedback on significant value that we provide in achieving their business objectives, not to mention the positive relationships they have with our team. We have proven our ability to deliver growth in a challenging environment while consistently managing the business top to bottom line in a balanced way. We remain highly motivated by our market opportunity as well as our platform leadership and we continue to innovate to meet our customers’ evolving needs to further differentiate ourselves in the market. And finally, we remain focused on solid execution, even through turbulent economic conditions to be in an even stronger position when the macro environment improves.
With that, let me turn the call over to Jim. Jim, it is great to have you on board for your first Dynatrace earnings call. Thank you, Rick and good morning everyone. I couldn’t be more thrilled to be at Dynatrace. As Rick said, Q3 was a quarter of solid execution across the Dynatrace team. In a dynamic macroeconomic environment, we delivered strong results, meeting the high-end of our guidance across all of our operating metrics: ARR, revenue, subscription revenue, operating margins and EPS. Overall, the value of the Dynatrace platform, the resiliency and predictability of our subscription model, the strength of our enterprise customer base and the disciplined execution across the business drove our performance. We have continued to demonstrate a durable and attractive business model and we expect to continue to deliver a balance of strong growth, profitability and cash flow.
Now, let’s dive into the third quarter results in more detail. Please note that the growth rates mentioned will be on a year-over-year basis and in constant currency, unless otherwise stated. As we have shared in the past, ARR is a key performance metric of the overall strength and health of the business and we delivered 29% adjusted ARR growth in the third quarter. Please keep in mind, adjusted ARR growth normalizes for currency and the wind down of perpetual license ARR, a reconciliation of which can be found on our IR website.
Total ARR for the third quarter was $1.16 billion, an increase of $233 million year-over-year and $98 million sequentially. Foreign exchange was a $29 million headwind year-over-year and a $19 million tailwind sequentially. Excluding the impact of currency and perpetual license roll-off, the net new ARR added in the quarter was $81 million, roughly $20 million higher than the expectations we shared in our last call, driven by strong new logo additions.
Moving on to the building blocks of ARR growth for the business, we added 250 new logos in the third quarter, up 4% year-over-year and exceeding our expectations. The average ARR for new logo lands was around $120,000 on a trailing 12-month basis, consistent with second quarter. In the third quarter, over 60% of our new logos landed with three or more modules supporting the shift towards a platform approach for observability. The value of the Dynatrace platform continues to resonate with prospects as they look to deliver rapid operational efficiencies in a tight budget environment. Dynatrace’s ability to quickly drive greater automation and efficiency that deliver strong ROI positions us well among strategic IT investment initiatives.
Our net expansion rate for the third quarter was just shy of 120%, driven by ongoing budget scrutiny and elongation of sales cycles. To be clear, the demand environment remains healthy. It just takes a bit longer to close deals. Gross retention rates remained strong in the mid-90s for the business, a testament to the value of the enterprise customers see in the Dynatrace platform. From an existing customer standpoint, we continue to see strength in multi-module adoption, with nearly 60% of our total customers now using 3 plus modules at an average ARR of nearly $500,000 per customer. And we continue to believe that as more and more customers adopt new modules and expand coverage over time, the average ARR per enterprise customer can grow to be north of $1 million.
Moving on to revenue, total revenue for the third quarter was $297 million and subscription revenue for the third quarter was $279 million, both up 29% year-over-year and exceeding the high-end of our guidance by $11 million, of which FX was $4 million. With respect to margins, which I will discuss on a non-GAAP basis, we have a very healthy margin profile, reflecting the value and efficiency of the Dynatrace platform. Gross margin for the third quarter was 84%, up 1 point from last quarter due to the growing scale of our subscription business and improved services gross margins.
As Rick indicated, investments in innovation and targeted go-to-market initiatives remain high priorities for us. For the third quarter, we invested $42 million in R&D or 14% of revenue. As many of you know, the vast majority of our engineering organization resides outside the U.S., providing us with much greater cost efficiency when compared to our competitors. On the go-to-market side, we invested $98 million in sales and marketing this quarter or 33% of revenue, down 200 basis points year-over-year and up 50 basis points sequentially as we ramp seasonal marketing program spend and continue to prioritize targeted investments in expanding our partner programs.
Our operating income for the third quarter was $81 million, resulting in an operating margin of 27%, exceeding the top end of the guidance range by over 150 basis points driven primarily by revenue upside and disciplined spend management. On the bottom line, non-GAAP net income was $73 million or $0.25 per share, $0.03 above the high end of our guidance range.
Turning now to the balance sheet, in December, we announced a new $400 million committed revolving credit facility that replaced the prior $60 million facility that was due to mature this August. We were very pleased with the execution of financing and used cash on hand to repay the remaining $221 million loan balance, rendering us debt-free. As of December 31, we had $422 million of cash, an increase of $14 million compared to the same period last year, and that’s after we paid off $311 million of debt over the last four quarters.
Our free cash flow was $58 million in the third quarter and $301 million on a trailing 12-month basis or 27% of revenue. We believe it is best to view free cash flow over a trailing 12-month period due to seasonality and variability in billings quarter-to-quarter. We are extremely pleased with our continued healthy cash generation and believe it puts us in a strong position to make the appropriate investments to accelerate our growth in select areas.
The last measure that I would like to discuss is our remaining performance obligation. RPO was approximately $1.7 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of 24% over Q3 of last year. The current portion of RPO, which we expect to recognize as revenue over the next four quarters, was $983 million, an increase of 25% year-over-year. It is important to remember that seasonality associated with bookings and contract upselling will cause variability in the RPO growth rates. As such, we continue to believe ARR is the best metric to understand the health and durability of the business as it removes noise associated with timing of billings.
Before I move to guidance, I want to give a brief update on the macro environment. Our ability to outperform in Q3 is a testament to the strong execution of the Dynatrace team. The demand environment remains healthy, the market opportunity is still growing, the observability ecosystem is still expanding, and deals are getting done, but with more budget scrutiny, and therefore, at a slower rate and pace. We are confident in the health of our pipeline and the team’s ability to execute in this environment even as macro headwinds persist. At the same time, we are closely monitoring our investments to continue delivering attractive levels of profitability while investing in targeted areas for growth. We will operate with the same rigor in Q4 and are confident that we’re factoring in the appropriate macro trends into our guidance.
Let’s start our guidance for the full fiscal year, again, with growth rates in constant currency. With more than 40% of our business denominated in foreign currency, the weakening of the U.S. dollar is creating less of a headwind than we had projected last quarter. We now expect the full year FX headwind to as-reported ARR to be approximately $30 million and approximately $45 million on revenue. This is compared to the nearly $60 million currency headwind to ARR and revenue guidance we expected last quarter. With that in mind, we now expect ARR to be between $1.216 billion and $1.221 billion, representing an adjusted ARR growth of 26%. This represents a $51 million increase at the midpoint on an as-reported basis. From a constant currency standpoint, this represents $21 million or a 200 basis point increase from prior guidance. Consistent with prior guidance, the perpetual license wind down for fiscal 2023 is expected to be approximately $8 million or 80 basis points.
Underpinning our ARR guidance, we now expect new logo growth to be roughly flat compared to last year, where we added 706 new logos. This is an increase compared to the previous quarter’s expectation of a 5% decline for the full year. We expect net expansion rate to be in the high teens, reflective of the tighter budget scrutiny and elongation of sales cycles. We are also raising our revenue guidance at the midpoint by $27 million for the year on an as-reported basis or 150 basis points in constant currency. We expect total revenue to be between $1.148 billion and $1.151 billion and subscription revenue to be between $1.075 billion and $1.077 billion, both of which result in 28% to 28.5% year-over-year growth.
From a profit standpoint, we remain committed to offsetting incremental macro headwinds with operational efficiencies and appropriate investment management. With that in mind, we are raising our non-GAAP operating margin guidance for fiscal 2023 to 25%, representing a 50 basis point increase compared to our prior guidance. We believe this will still enable us to make the appropriate investments in both R&D and sales and marketing.
We are raising non-GAAP EPS guidance to $0.87 to $0.88 per share, representing an increase of $0.06 on the low end and $0.05 on the high end. This non-GAAP EPS is based on a diluted share count of 292 million to 293 million shares and a non-GAAP effective cash tax rate of 11%. And finally, we expect free cash flow to be between $315 million and $321 million, representing a free cash flow margin of 27.5% to 28% of revenue, down 25 basis points at the midpoint as we firmed up cash tax expectations, which are slightly higher than prior guidance.
As a reminder, our full year free cash flow was positively impacted by a one-time tax refund of approximately $35 million in the first quarter. As we think about free cash flow beyond fiscal 2023, we generally expect to see non-GAAP operating margin and free cash flow margins to align on a tax-neutral basis. Therefore, we expect free cash flow margins on an as-reported basis to be slightly lower than op margins, given expected increase in cash tax rates as we fully utilize our tax loss and credit carryovers and generate increased levels of profitability.
Looking to Q4, we expect total revenue to be between $304 million and $307 million or 24% to 25% growth. Subscription revenue is expected to be between $285 million and $287 million, up 24% to 25% year-over-year. From a profit standpoint, non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $71.5 million and $73.5 million, 24% of revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $0.22 to $0.23 per share. Keep in mind that we have some seasonal expenses taking place in the fourth quarter, including incremental spend related to our Perform conference as well as a structural reset of payroll taxes.
In summary, we are pleased with our third quarter fiscal 2023 performance where we saw solid ARR and top line growth, combined with healthy cash margins amidst a dynamic environment. We have a proven track record of consistent execution. And as we have consistently demonstrated, we are committed to maintaining a disciplined and balanced approach to optimizing costs and improving efficiency and profitability while continuing to invest in future growth opportunities that we expect will drive long-term value.
And with that, we will open the line for questions. Operator? Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Great. Thanks, guys for taking my questions. Congrats on the execution in a tough environment. Rick, for you. Your comment that Dynatrace directly benefits from cloud optimization, I found that to be a really fascinating comment. Obviously, many investors that we talk to are concerned that cloud optimization could actually hurt observability vendors. Could you talk a little bit more about that dynamic? Sure. Thanks very much, Matt. In many ways, I think the cloud optimization is precisely what Dynatrace was built to do. Digital transformation is obviously alive and well, and it’s driving a huge number of workloads, as we all know, to the cloud in terms of cloud migration and cloud deployment. But companies increasingly want to make sure they’re getting an ROI. They want to make sure that they are delivering software that works perfectly. They want to make sure that they’re delivering exceptional customer satisfaction and user satisfaction. And this is really all about cloud optimization. And in fact, that’s what Dynatrace does. We bring – we like to think we bring order to the chaos of the cloud. And in many ways, I think cloud optimization is precisely what is going to drive Dynatrace from being optional to mandatory in cloud deployments as we look ahead. Got it. Thank you. And then maybe one for Jim, obviously, you didn’t guide to fiscal ‘24 yet. It may be a bit early, but wondering if you have any just high-level building blocks, things like sales capacity expectations, new logos, etcetera, as we sort of fine-tune our growth and profitability estimates for next year? Yes. You’re right. We’re going to provide a lot more color on fiscal ‘24 in our May call. I will say, obviously, I’ve been here a couple of months now, a fantastic quarter for the company. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, relative to building blocks that we actually did a little bit better on new customer logos in the third quarter. And so, I think as we’ve talked about building blocks in the past, call it, roughly third is going to come from new logos and call it two-third is going to come from expansion. And you can expect those, call it, approximate ranges going into fiscal ‘24. Got it. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with SVB. Please proceed with your questions. Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. And Jim, welcome back to your first Dynatrace earnings call. I’m just going to ask one question, so you can fit as many in as possible. I think one of the questions that I get a lot is when Microsoft reported, they talked about weakening at the end of the quarter, in particular, in terms of Azure growth. Can you just talk about what you saw at the end of the quarter dynamics and how this quarter kind of started? That’s a great question. So, I would tell you that the linearity for our business actually kind of came in roughly in line with what we thought when we started the quarter. So I’d say, no real change. I will – having said that, I will say that, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, that there is no doubt that the current macroeconomic environment has certainly resulted in more budget scrutiny, and therefore, kind of sales cycles are certainly elongated, but I would say, not materially different than they were in the second quarter. And so, our linearity kind of came in line with what we thought. And going forward, we kind of expect similar elongation of sales cycles. I will say that the demand environment is quite healthy. Our pipeline is healthy. I think our coverage is healthy. I actually think that now that we’ve been dealing with this for a few quarters, our sales team is much better at kind of responding and forecasting the business. And so, we have pretty good visibility and pretty good comfort kind of in our guide. Got it. Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Please proceed with your question. Yes. Thank you. I was going to ask two, if I could. One, I wanted to see if you could revisit on the intent and how it might manifest over time of the change of pricing in packages – packaging, rather. Bundling has been done for years and years and years by many large organizations to try to gain share of wallet. But maybe describe, you said you’ve had success. What are some of the attributes of that success? And what do you hope this accomplishes over a longer period of time? In particular, I am just hoping to get some more granularity on how this enables you to mix up, so to speak or gain incremental share of wallet? Sure, I’ll take that one, Keith. So our DPS pricing model, which is – I imagine what you’re referring to, we got, as I mentioned, approximately 100 customers or so on DPS. It tends to be our largest customers. They are all multi-module or virtually all multi-module and what they are wanting to do is they are wanting to have more flexibility in scaling up and down workloads and frankly, adding and subtracting modules in a very fluid basis. So what we have in DPS is essentially a committed model, but it enables a spend across multi modules and multiple workloads. And that’s precisely what we’re trying to do. That model enables us to, therefore, remove friction in the selling process. And rather than having to go back and for example, into a customer and selling AppSec, in many ways, a DPS customer would already own AppSec. They only need to deploy it and turn up that workload whenever they’re ready. So it really does create more fluidity in the selling and deployment process, and that’s precisely why we see it as an ARR accretive model. And just to before ask my next question, do you have any evidence on kind of what that does to your net retention rate? I mean, is it too early to know? Or does it take your net retention rate to 30% or something along those lines? Retention rates, ARR, all of the metrics point positive with DPS deployment. Now some of that is probably biased by the fact that these are our largest customers. The ones who see Dynatrace being more strategic and so therefore, it’s probably a bit conflated in fairness, but it is a very positive set of metrics that we see in DPS deployments. Okay. And moving to my second question, you talked about your second kind of strategic areas, real-time data process, getting into log management and analytics. Could you just describe where you’re having success in that area? In particular, what are you displacing in order to generate that success? On the log management and analytics which is where Grail is really preliminarily focused as a massively parallel processing data lake house. The workloads that customers are looking to deploy are those that observe our observability-oriented workloads. And those are the ones where there’s high analytic requirement. And in particular, that is where Grail really shines most. So that’s where we’re seeing the workloads come to pass and fruition with Grail. They want to essentially reduce cost, improve performance and drastically move to faster near real-time analytics, and that’s what we provide with Grail. Okay, many thanks. Cheers. Our next question is from the line of Kamil Mielczarek with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. Good morning, everyone and congrats on cloud results. I just want to follow-up on the new logo adds. I believe they were at an all-time high and I think the strongest sequential growth in 2 years. Can you provide some more detail around some of the specific drivers, whether around new product intros, ledges cycles or the go-to-market strategy that drove this uptick in wins despite a tougher macro environment? Yes. I guess I’ll comment on that. I’ll tell you that we obviously had a range of new logos in our pipeline kind of from a low to a high. And I would say we were prudent in the guide for the third quarter, trying to acknowledge that buying cycles are elongated and in particular, they can be even more elongated for a new customer than someone that is an existing customer. And I think it’s attribute to the value that customers see because in many cases, these customers have already gone through a POC. So they’ve already seen the value of the Dynatrace platform. And so, I think what we saw here was that – a couple of things. One, we started to see maybe better close rates than we expected as far as the quarter is concerned. I also think that there had been some adjustments in the selling model for the company earlier in the year to get a little bit more focus on, I’ll call it, hunting versus farming and I think you’re starting to see some traction as a result of that. That’s helpful. And a quick one on competition, have you seen any changes in the competitive environment whether around increased customer scrutiny on head-to-head deals or in terms of who you are seeing on these deals? No. I mean, if you’re referring to the competitive environment, I’d say the competitive landscape is pretty similar. I mean, our win rates are quite strong, but no real change in kind of the competitive environment, still very competitive environment. And you got to win based on having the best offering. And I think when we go head-to-head we win the majority of the time. And I would just add to that, Kamil, that we continue to say that and see that the biggest competitor is DIY over and over and over again. We walk in, we see open source code, we see solutions that were homegrown, internally built, and it really is very consistent with our thesis of moving from data and dashboards and simple displays of red, yellow, green to something much more sophisticated in terms of answers and intelligent automation from that data that these days, we believe, are required to run modern cloud ecosystems. Thanks, really helpful. And thanks for taking my questions. Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Joel Fishbein with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your questions. Thank you and also congrats on a strong execution and Jim welcome to the first call. Rick, a quick question for you, you mentioned app security. It’s obviously a good focus. I know it’s very early days, but it’s really a pretty competitive environment out there. Love to hear what the customers are saying about Dynatrace and how you’re approaching that market and maybe some of the competitive differentiation you might bring to the table, considering a lot of the security-centric guys are trying to attack this market as well? Appreciate it. Right. Thanks Joel. The AppSec market, as you pointed out, is very crowded and this is why the strategy around Dynatrace associated with this market is really oriented to ensuring that the AppSec areas in which we participate are those that gain leverage from our overall platform deployment. Where observability and AppSec converge, those are the AppSec areas where we are going to be able do most significantly differentiate and add value to customers. And so that’s precisely where we are focused, starts with areas like vulnerability management and extends from there into additional areas that we are investing in now. Great. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pinjalim Bora with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. Hi. Great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. I want to ask you about just the performance across the different tiers [ph]. Did you see the challenging macro environment kind of spill over outside of Europe? Do you see it in Americas? And the second part of the question is just on the fiscal ‘24, since everybody is trying to figure that out. Another way of asking it, I guess what are you seeing or hearing from customers in terms of how IT budgets are being set for calendar year 2023 and observability within that? So, I want to make sure I have the two questions. So, one, you want to get a bit of color on kind of the geography kind of view of things. And then obviously, I understand your point about fiscal ‘24 not necessarily on our guide, but specifically around customers in their budget decision. So, I would say relative to kind of the geography dynamics, I would say that obviously, the macro environment is affecting all geographies. I will say for our third quarter, we did perform a bit better than we expected in our EMEA region. That certainly has been a region that we had called out previously as being a region that’s soft. So, better execution in the EMEA region. And I would say a little bit softer in North America. But in general, I would say it’s a dynamic macro environment everywhere. But I would say our performance was a little bit stronger in EMEA in the third quarter and a little bit weaker in North America. But I wouldn’t necessarily suggest that, that is a significant change from what it’s been. But I think that we just had better execution in EMEA in the third quarter. And relative to the customers and their budgets, I think your – the way I have kind of seen it, we are beginning our budget cycle. So, as you can imagine, I am dealing with it myself that I think customers are looking at their budgets. They are scrutinizing areas of their IT spend specifically and trying to prioritize areas that they believe are more strategic. So, I would say budgets are probably going to be conservative. But they are still spending, and they are spending on areas that help them optimize. And as Rick outlined, we believe that the space that we are in is actually an area that they are continuing to spend money on. And so to me, it’s not so much a budget question. It’s more of a as you are going through deal cycles, you are just dealing with just a longer cycle, you are dealing with more approval levels, which just slows deals down. And so in particular for our specific guide for the fourth quarter, where you are acknowledging that deal cycles sometimes can push from month-to-month. But in general, the demand healthy is strong – demand environment is strong. Got it. Thank you very much. Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Andrew Nowinski with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Great. Thank you. Congrats on a great quarter. So, I guess I just want to ask maybe a higher-level question. If you look at your guidance for ARR and new logos and subscription revenue, it looks like that second cut to guidance you made last quarter turned out to be unnecessary. And I know FX is hard to predict, and it’s now less of a headwind. But I was wondering if you could put a finer point on what else may have changed in the market over the last three months that enabled you to bring that guidance kind of back to the original level you gave in Q1? Yes, I certainly wasn’t here back then. So, I can comment a bit. I do believe that when the guidance was provided in the last call, I think there was a level of prudence to be very frank, on the guidance. So, I think that’s one element of it. I will say that we did kind of exceed even our internal expectations in the third quarter. And as I have said earlier, I think that we had a couple of quarters earlier in the year where the sales organization was trying to figure out how do you forecast close rates in an environment where customer buying is a little bit uncertain and deals maybe take longer. And so, I think we have learned from that. We learned from that in the first half of the year. I think they are better at calling that. And so I think that’s maybe a function of why you are seeing us kind of maybe glide back to what we said in the first quarter. And we have pretty good confidence that we can execute to the numbers that we have outlined. I would just add to that. Look, we saw increasing strength in Europe during the period relative to the prior quarter. That was good to see. We saw strong positive results in new logos. As Jim mentioned earlier, that gave us confidence as well. Of course, we delivered a strong Q3. So, we put those together and that leads us to the updated view of where we are today. Going back to the prior question, I would also just say that as in prior quarters, we are continuing to assume a fairly soft spend environment from a macro perspective overall through at least the first couple of quarters of our fiscal ‘24. And so we are going into this with a good amount of prudence. That’s great. Thank you for that color. And maybe just a quick follow-up on the GSIs, you have got 10 GSIs now in a number of different routes to market. So, you have got the GSI hyperscalers are a big contributor. Resellers and of course, your direct sales, I think capacity set is up about 20%. I am just wondering if you could maybe rank your various routes to market and how we should think about that in fiscal ‘24 as being the biggest contributor to your growth? Sure. Well, it’s – we have had a primarily direct model previously, but we have already reported in the past that more than 50% of our deals are partner influenced and partner delivered. So, we already have a very strong presence with partners. I would say that, that will simply continue. And where we believe we get the flywheel momentum and more movement in the model from a go-to-market perspective is really through partners. And as we indicated in the prepared remarks, we really see those as primarily coming from hyperscalers and GSIs. Super. Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Hey. Thanks. Congrats from me as well. Could I go back to Matt’s question at the beginning, Rick. So, when you talked about the – when we talk about the optimization, I believe like from – like I was on the Maxo [ph] calls as well as their comments were more, like people had overcommitted maybe to their cloud. There were some big contracts and now you are kind of trying to think about how you run that. How do you see that play out for you? And you talked a little bit about that already, do you see that optimization as, like less workloads going to the cloud, or is it more the workloads I have, I want to run them more effectively? And then I have one follow-up. Well, Raimo, certainly, there is an element of cost optimization here as well as Sathya talked about in the Microsoft call, Azure. So, there is no question that, that’s occurring as some cost rationalization. But there is also, as I mentioned, a key element, which is overall cloud workload optimization, which is making sure that you are getting the most out of the cloud deployments that you have made. And that’s really where Dynatrace comes in play in making sure that you are really getting positive ROI, delivering exceptional end-user satisfaction, that that software works perfectly. And remember, sort of our overall thesis from the beginning is that cloud workloads make it easier to expand more rapidly. That creates an explosion of data, an increase in its complexity and it renders manual management and oversight of those workloads much more difficult. And we automate that. We automate that process to enable you to do more with less, and that’s really what cloud optimization is about. So, we feel that that cloud optimization is a very consistent trend with cloud done right and our efforts to entre. Yes. Okay. Perfect. And then the other – and there were lots of positive numbers out here today, but the one – nice one that stood out to me was the customer add number. And you mentioned the global SIs. What do you see in terms of buildup of practice, people addition to what the global SIs are doing? And are there more – some that are spending out more? Is it a theme for a lot of them? Can you talk to that, please? Thank you and congrats from me as well. Sure. Thanks Raimo. The GSIs are, I would say, growing with us at different rates. But as you can see, we now have 10 that we are working with. And those 10 have trained literally hundreds and hundreds of people on Dynatrace. And the result of that is that we have more and more capacity in the GSIs to get Dynatrace deployed effectively for their customers. Now, GSI efforts are time consuming. They tend to be large digital transformation projects for typically larger companies that are part of overall workloads. In fact, we closed a very significant one that I referenced in the call down in LatAm last quarter is a multimillion dollar, multiyear deal as part of a large digital transformation deployment with a GSI. These are the kinds of deals that we believe that we will see over time and that will become a core component of. So, it’s going to take some time, but we believe that working with a number of different GSIs helps to get us there. Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Cikos with Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question. Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the time here and Jim, looking forward to working with you. I just wanted to cycle back. I am trying to square two pieces here, and I just wanted to see if I could put this in front of you. I think in response to Kamil’s question, there was a comment that new logo adds partially benefited from close rates coming in better than expected. So, can you help us understand what Dynatrace is now assuming for its close rates as we think about Q4 and what’s incorporated into the flat new logo adds that we are looking for on a year-to-year basis? And then I guess in conjunction with that as well, I know coming back to Andrew’s question, it sounds like your sales force is, I think the quote, was better at calling how those close rates play out. And again, just want to see what level of conservatism or prudence we are baking in here? Has that prudence in any way changed just given that you guys are operating in this dynamic backdrop? Happy to kind of follow-up on that. So, as I have said, that the new logo adds were better than we expected. As you can imagine, we had a kind of a range of outcomes. And as I said, that the close rates were just a little bit stronger. Relative to Q4, I would say we are not assuming a significant improvement in close rates. As a matter of fact, I think we are continuing to exercise prudence in close rates. That’s reflected in the guide. So, I don’t want you to get nervous that we are getting ahead of ourselves here, given kind of a strong Q3. And I do believe that – I obviously wasn’t here in the first half of the year. But I can tell you from the few months that I have been here that is quite significant rigor with the sales force around discussing and forecasting the business. And it’s just a general level of prudence across the sales force around deal cycles, deals being longer and we are expecting that. They are starting to reflect that in kind of the close rates and when they think things will close. And so, as you can imagine what that means is you need to have good coverage, you need to have good pipeline and you need to have good win rates. And I would say all of those things look quite strong. And so, the area we are being prudent on is close rates. But I would say, we certainly have a good funnel, a good pipe and good coverage. So, there is more than enough to be able to offset possible kind of deals pushing from one quarter to the next. That’s great color. I really do appreciate that, Jim. And if I could just have one follow-up for Rick. But coming back to Grail, just wanted to see, is there a way to compare how that – I know that there is the underlying technology and you have like log analytics and management sitting there. You announced power analytics. What are the adoption trends you are seeing or the customer reception versus maybe prior product launches? And really, what I am getting at is if we are talking about DPS and this bundling approach for your largest customers, is it fair to assume that newer product launches, like log analytics or power analytics, as an example, shouldn’t we assume that they can potentially scale faster because DPS is enabling that greater flexibility for those customers? We certainly hope so. We certainly hope so that is the expectation around DPS is that it enables full module deployment. That includes infrastructure, which is where log management and analytics typically would sit. So, that is precisely the opportunity ahead. We did talk about a six module deployment in the prepared remarks, which included Grail. And that’s a great example of enabling precisely that motion, Mike. So, we feel very good about where we are with Grail. As I mentioned, we have more than 160 POCs that are currently out there already, many paying customers that have converted those orders. It’s very, very early in the Grail deployment, as you know, we just jaded in October. So, it’s still new, and customers are still testing it. But we are very pleased with where we are in Grail at this point. Prefect. I will turn it over to my colleagues, but I really do appreciate the answers. Thank you. Thank you. Our final question will be coming from the line of Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Okay. Thanks. Good morning. Rick, I wanted to talk about growth for fiscal ‘24, where Jim talked about expect one-third new, two-thirds from customer expansion from a mix perspective. On the expansion piece, you also talked about how budgets right now are generally pressured, their scrutiny. It’s got a tight budget for existing customers, but we need to get a lot of growth from expansion with those existing customers. The two-fold question, one, how do you cultivate growth with the existing customers given that budget scrutiny dynamic? And two, maybe why not pivot more to new customer growth in fiscal ‘24 as a better vector? And I have a follow-up. Thanks. Well, the – I think the opportunity, Adam, is in both areas. And we focus on both of them equally. We need and want to close new customers. We also want to expand the existing workloads. And if I look at net expansion opportunities with the existing customers, there are a number of different areas. One is the expansion of existing workloads. So, of an existing workload, I am adding capacity and those tend to be a fairly normal order cycle. Then you have new modules. Well, this is where DPS might come in or partner selling could come in to expand those sets of capabilities as well. And then you have other adjacencies, AppSec, Grail and other areas as well that are significant opportunities and/or for new applications. So, we will look at all of those as expansionary opportunity as we look ahead. The other point that I would make on new logos is that we announced last quarter, more than 60% of new logos closed with multiple modules with more than three modules, three or more modules. So, that is something that we are also seeing is more platform selling into the new logo area. Got it. Okay. That’s helpful. And maybe just a follow-up, Jim. New ARR in Q3 was better than expected at down 13% fully adjusted. I think if I am backing into the guidance for Q4, it implies that metric is going to be down about 20% year-over-year. I am just wondering, we have got this kind of cadence of decelerating growth in that new ARR piece. But beyond Q4, I mean how do we think about the puts and takes to new ARR trends? Do you think Q4 could potentially be a bottom at that down 20%, or do we still have tough comps in the first part of next year? Just trying to get a sense of cadence of new ARR declines and when we might see the bottom. Thanks. Yes. I mean I will just – we obviously had a very strong Q3, effectively $20 million higher than our expectations that I think we had shared before that we thought net new ARR would be about $120 million in the back half, call it, split 50-50 between Q3 and Q4, came in at roughly 80%. So, Q4 is effectively consistent with what we shared before and it reflects prudence in our guide. Relative to fiscal ‘24, I certainly don’t want to get ahead of ourselves and start providing guidance on fiscal ‘24 on this call. But I will tell you that we will build a similar level of prudence into our fiscal ‘24 guide when we talk to you guys about it in May. And I think we will have – obviously, we will have the benefit of another three months of seeing what the macro environment is doing. It’s pretty dynamic. As Rick said, we don’t expect any significant improvement in the environment. And we are actually managing the business with that in mind. And it’s one of the things that I will just end with that I really liked when I joined the company of the balance of very strong growth in this company with profitability. It’s just a great recipe. And I think you are seeing kind of our peers were not as balanced. And so they are having to exercise some new muscles. These are not new muscles for Dynatrace. And so I think we are in a good position to continue to make the investments where we need to for the long-term opportunity. And as macro conditions improve, we should be able to capitalize on that. Thank you. Okay. Well, thank you everybody for joining. I think that Jim’s remarks on balance of top line growth and profitability are exactly where we would like to finish the call because that is how we are running the company. And we are doing so with good prudence. We are delighted about the strong Q3 results that we just delivered and very, very bullish as we look to our market opportunity as we look ahead, not to mention our growing platform differentiation. For those of you joining us in person at Perform in Las Vegas, I look forward to seeing you there in a couple of weeks and I wish you all a very good day. This concludes today’s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

[Operator Instructions] A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Noelle Faris, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Noelle. Good morning and thank you for joining Dynatrace’s fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Rick McConnell, Chief Executive Officer and Jim Benson, Chief Financial Officer.
Before we get started, please note that today’s comments include forward-looking statements such as statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance and economic conditions. Actual results may differ materially from our expectations due to a number of risks and uncertainties discussed in Dynatrace’s SEC filings, including our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q and our upcoming annual report on Form 10-K that we plan to file later this month. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's views on May 17, 2023. We assume no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information, future events or circumstances.
Unless otherwise noted, the growth rates we discussed today are non-GAAP reflecting constant currency growth rates and per share amounts are on a diluted basis. We will also discuss other non-GAAP financial measures on today's call. We provide reconciliations between non-GAAP and GAAP measures in today's earnings press release and in the financial presentation slides posted in the Events section of our website.
And with that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Rick McConnell. Rick? Thanks, Noelle and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for today's call. Dynatrace delivered an exceptional finished FY 2023 with fourth quarter results that exceeded expectations across the board. For the full-year, adjusted ARR growth, constant currency subscription revenue growth, and free cash flow margin were all 29%.
I'd like to thank the nearly 4,200 Dynatracers globally for their incredible commitment to excellence and tremendous execution this past year. These results continue to demonstrate our ability to run a balanced business that has been delivering high growth coupled with strong bottom line performance. They are a testament to the strength of our market, the significant customer value of our unified observability and security platform, our people and partners and the ongoing durability of our business model. Jim will share more details about our Q4 performance and fiscal 2024 guidance in a moment.
In the meantime, I'd like to share my view of the broader market dynamics, primary use cases that are driving customer buying behavior and significant investment areas for FY ‘24 and beyond. Let's start with our market opportunity. We believe the estimated $50 billion market for observability and application security is at an inflection point. The complexity of modern technology ecosystems is forcing companies to move from in-house or open source dashboards to much more sophisticated observability solutions that deliver vastly improved insights and automation.
Additionally, we expect that AI technologies such as generative AI and predictive analytics will contribute to this inflection point. In particular, we believe AI technology advancements will increase the volume and complexity of software delivery. Further strengthening the need for observability and security with automation and AI at its core. We are fully equipped already today in our platform, help customers navigate AI initiatives and are in early stages of actively collaborating with the hyperscalers to create secure enterprise ready offerings that bring the power of generative AI and predictive analytics to market.
This past quarter, AWS, Azure and GCP reported over $175 billion in combined annualized revenue. Yet Andy Jassy, Amazon's CEO estimated that 90% of global IT spend is still on premises and poised to move to the cloud. For these and other reasons, we believe the market opportunity for observability and security of cloud-based workloads is enormous.
Without question, the cloud yields undeniable benefits, including accelerated product development, increased supply chain efficiencies, improved customer satisfaction and more. At the same time though, the cloud has also brought some notable challenges. In particular, the scale and dynamic nature of modern cloud ecosystems have made them too complex to manage through legacy monitoring approaches and manual troubleshooting. Effective operations require more than dashboards and alerts.
As such, we believe automated observability is rapidly moving from optional commandatory. Dynatrace makes order out of this chaos, we leverage sophisticated causal AI capabilities, and a comprehensive understanding of an organization's hybrid and multi-cloud ecosystem to deliver rapid insights in real time along with actionable remediation. We enabled delivery of more reliable infrastructure and applications, improved application security, and more successful digital transformation initiatives. And we believe we are uniquely positioned to lead this market evolution by providing the only fully unified end-to-end platform for observability and application security with analytics and automation at its core.
I’d now like to offer several specific use cases that have become key drivers of our customers' purchasing behavior. First, companies are looking to deliver highly performing cloud native infrastructure and applications. We as end users expect applications to work perfectly. Many organizations underestimate the complexity of the microservice processes required to manage their cloud workloads effectively.
In Q4, one of the top 10 global financial services companies broadly expanded their deployment with a mid-seven figure Dynatrace Platform Subscription or DPS deal to ensure their growing footprint of infrastructure and applications continues to run smoothly. Beginning of DPS, we made it available to our entire customer base last month. With DPS, we are now making our solution set broadly and easily accessible through a simplified cross platform licensing model. This model allows customers to trial and deploy any aspect of our solution such as logs or AppSec, while leveraging a single commit. We expect DPS will drive net expansion and become an accelerant to ARR in future periods.
Second, companies want to increase productivity and accelerate software delivery through cloud native technologies and processes. We believe the adoption of agile development, continuous deployment and DevOps will drive accelerated demand for automated observability solutions to ensure development teams deliver secure high quality releases faster. In Q4, a Fortune 50 technology company embraced a shift left approach and delivered self-service observability and security to their development teams, resulting in increased innovation through automation.
Third, organizations are seeking cost effective and more insightful log management at scale. They tell us that they are spending too much time and money on slow and limited analytics and forensics that add few insights to their businesses without substantial manual engagement. Companies are capturing logs, but a log without context of other data types fails to enable rapid reaction to changing business conditions. We now have a major retailer spending seven figures with us to take advantage of the insights their log management solution provides with rail.
Fourth, companies are spending substantial sums to ensure delivery of secure cloud applications. Global data compliance requirements, an increase in software vulnerabilities, end user data breach concerns, and brand impact are among the many contributors to this trend. We closed our largest application security deal to-date, a seven-figure expansion with the same Fortune 50 company I mentioned earlier they help secure their cloud applications from vulnerabilities. We now have nearly 400 AppSec customers and remain on track toward our goal of reaching $100 million in security ARR by the end of fiscal 2025.
Fifth, companies are increasingly coming to Dynatrace for us to provide a fully unified observability solution at scale. This especially applies to the vast array of organizations often using dozens of disparate tools in an effort to manage their software ecosystem. They struggle with a fragmented set of capabilities that lack a single source of truth, making it difficult to develop meaningful insights. This need for unified observability at scale, including a consolidation of other third-party solutions is what Brazil's Financial Ecosystem App PicPay in addition to a leading French SaaS marketing company to displace and consolidate their existing monitoring tools and sign seven-figure deals with Dynatrace in Q4.
And finally, we discussed cloud optimization last quarter as a tailwind for Dynatrace being a headwind for the cloud providers. One part of cloud optimization is about cost optimization, reducing or eliminating ancillary workloads. Critical workloads, however, generally cannot be eliminated. Organizations need these workloads to be optimized, to run more efficiently and with less manual oversight to ensure maximum return from their cloud environments. These are the areas in which cloud optimization plays directly into our mantra of cloud done right.
And this is precisely the value that Dynatrace provides through process automation, faster deployment of software and dramatically improved analytics. Given that we are at the beginning of a new fiscal year and following directly on the pain points that are driving purchasing decisions I'd like to wrap up with some of our primary investment areas as we look to the future. Keep in mind, our approach to investments remains unchanged. We take a targeted and prudent approach and we plan to balance our investments to grow the top line, while also delivering modest margin expansion in fiscal ‘24.
First, we plan to leverage both in our R&D, as well as go to market efforts, the demand shift from point products and observability to a unified analytics and automation platform. As I noted, customers are looking for a single solution that cohesively solves a variety of use cases. Our platform processes all data types, logs, metrics, traces, open telemetry, real user data, behavioral analytics and more in a single contextual data store with near real time analytics. We believe our core technologies of Davis, Grail, OneAgent, PurePath and Smartscape combined to deliver a radically different approach to solve the observability challenge and provide enormous platform differentiation relative to the more siloed approach of our competitors.
Second, we continue to invest in security expansion. We see an ongoing convergence of observability and application security in large part, because the insights derived from observability enable a much more comprehensive and time critical security response. We recently conducted an independent global survey of 1,300 CIOs in large organizations. The research revealed that 68% of CIOs found it increasingly difficult to keep their software secure given the growing complexity of their hybrid and multi-cloud environments. We are expanding our efforts from vulnerability management where we participate today to adjacent areas in both agent-driven and data-driven security.
Third, we are accelerating investment in developer observability. Development teams are increasingly expected to incorporate observability capabilities into their solutions or shift left, as well as assume greater ownership for availability and operational management or shift right. BizDevSecOps will become more crucial in this environment. At minimum, we expect development teams to have growing influence over the observability, application security and automation environments. And thus, we intend to expand both our R&D, as well as our go to market initiatives to deliver best-in-class observability to this audience.
Fourth, we are executing against a broad-based set of initiatives around optimizing and expanding our go to market. We remain focused on the global 15,000, where complexity and the value of automation and analytics at scale are greatest. In addition to our planned salesforce expansion during FY ‘24, we increasingly expect to leverage partners to drive a flywheel of opportunity. Partners today already influence nearly two-thirds of our new ARR, but they account for a much smaller percentage of deal origination.
Hyperscalers play an important role in the frictionless onboarding of customers. In fact, new ARR transacted through our largest hyperscaler partner grew by more than 80% in FY ‘23 versus the prior year. We also saw strong traction from the investments we made in growing our relationships with global system integrators, driven both by direct overlap in our customer basis, as well as the highly synergistic value they can deliver to clients in digital transformation projects. We ended the fiscal year with 10 strategic GSI partners and a few including Deloitte and DXC have built Dynatrace into their reference architectures.
A final area of investment is in customer success. Fiscal ‘23 was a year of incredible innovation with the delivery of critical new functionality enabling improved log management, enhance infrastructure monitoring and application security, improve user experience and access to insights, faster application development and broader automation tools. We are driving fiscal ‘24 as a year of customer adoption and value realization. We want our customers to derive maximum value from our solution set and enable them to solve not one, but several of the use cases I described earlier. We expect this will also drive net expansion and contribute to future ARR growth.
In closing, we are proud to have delivered a tremendous finish to FY ‘23. Despite ongoing macro headwinds, that continue to create market uncertainty. We drove record levels of ARR and revenue with excellent operating margins and cash flow generation. Additionally, we are innovating at a very rapid pace with groundbreaking new customer solutions and platform enhancements. Our products uniquely address the challenges that our customers face with a high degree of differentiation around data-driven automation and analytics. We are building upon and evolving our go to market initiatives, including increased leverage with formidable partners who are expanding their digital transformation practices to include observability. And we remain passionate about delivering ever more value to our customers.
With that, let me turn the call over to Jim. Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As Rick mentioned, Q4 was another quarter of great execution by the Dynatrace team. In a dynamic macroeconomic environment, we delivered strong results beating the high-end of our guidance across all of our key operating metrics. ARR, total revenue, subscription revenue, operating margin, free cash flow, and EPS. These continued strong results were driven by the combination of solid new logo lands to the Dynatrace platform.
The ongoing expansion of existing customers and an inherently efficient business model, allowing us to deliver a sustained balance of growth and profitability. Our ability to successfully navigate through a tight budgetary environment is a testament to the resilience of our value proposition our commitment to customer success and our incredible team.
Now let's dive into the fourth quarter results in more detail. Please note that the growth rates mentioned will be on a year-over-year basis and in constant currency unless otherwise stated. As we have shared in the past, ARR is a key performance metric of the overall strength and health of the business, and we delivered 29% adjusted ARR growth exceeding the high-end of our guidance range by 300 basis points. Please keep in mind, adjusted ARR growth normalizes for currency and the wind down of perpetual license ARR, a reconciliation of which can be found on our IR website.
We saw broad-based strength across most geographies and verticals with notable strength in North America and Latin America and within the government, insurance, banking and financial services verticals, despite the current volatility in the banking sector.
Total ARR for the fourth quarter ended at $1.25 billion, an increase of $252 million year-over-year. Foreign exchange was a $29 million headwind year-over-year. Excluding the impact of currency and the perpetual license roll off, we added $84 million of net new ARR in the fourth quarter, that's $26 million above the high-end of our guidance, driven by some notable seven-figure competitive wins, and consistent expansion across the customer base, including $13 million of expansions associated with early renewals scheduled to close in the first quarter of ‘24.
This is the first time in our history as a public company where we saw a sequential increase over our seasonally strongest third quarter. We ended the year with more than 3,600 Dynatrace customers representing an increase of 9% over last year. Our gross retention rates continue to be best-in-class in the mid-90s and contributed to a strong dollar based net retention rate of 119% in the fourth quarter. We added 179 new logos in the fourth quarter, for a total of nearly 700 new logos this fiscal year. ARR per new logo was particularly strong highlighting the market trend away from point solutions toward platform adoption.
In the fourth quarter, 65% of our new logos landed with three or more modules, up from approximately 50% a year ago, driving our average new logo land up to more than $130,000 on a 12-month trailing basis. We were pleased with the uptick in the average sizes of the new logo lands, including several large competitive takeouts. This aligns well with our focus on the quality of lands that have a greater propensity to expand.
As we've mentioned in the past, we believe that the average ARR for enterprise customer could be $1 million or more given the significant cross-sell and expansion opportunities in our customer base. Over 60% of our customers are using three or more modules with an average ARR of over $500,000. And customers with four or more modules have an average ARR of nearly $700,000.
Moving on to revenue, total revenue the fourth quarter was $314 million, $7 million above the high-end of our guidance. Total revenue grew 27%, compared to the fourth quarter last year. Subscription revenue for the fourth quarter was $293 million, $6 million above the high-end of our guidance. Subscription revenue grew 28%, compared to the fourth quarter last year.
With respect to margins, total non-GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter was 84% consistent with both last year and Q3 levels. Our non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter was $78 million, $4 million above the high-end of our guidance range, due to the revenue upside in the quarter. This resulted in a non-GAAP operating margin of 25% exceeding our guidance by roughly 100 basis points.
Non-GAAP net income was $92 million or $0.31 per share, this is $0.08 above the high-end of our guidance range, primarily driven by some strategic tax planning opportunities and favorable revenue performance. On a GAAP basis, our net income was $80 million or $0.27 per share. We highlight this GAAP financial metric, because following several years of profitability, we determined that we are now able to realize a substantial portion of our deferred tax assets in the U.S. The release of the valuation allowance against these assets resulted in a $40 million GAAP P&L benefit in FY ‘23.
Turning to a quick summary of the financial results for the full-year. Total revenue was $1.16 billion and subscription revenue was $1.08 billion both of which grew 29% year-over-year. Before we move on to operating income, I wanted to provide a quick update on our methodology for allocating certain operating expenses across R&D, sales and marketing and G&A.
In the past, depreciation expense was primarily allocated to G&A, as the company scales and invests across functions, we believe a better presentation is to have the cost aligned with the related use of the assets. In the fourth quarter, we made the decision to revise our methodology to allocate depreciation expenses, which are mostly facilities related across R&D, sales and marketing and G&A. We also recast Q1 through Q3 accordingly. There is no impact to total operating expense, but you will see approximately 100 basis points of reduction in G&A and a corresponding total increase in sales and marketing and R&D to align to this new methodology.
Non-GAAP operating income for the year was $292 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 25%. Non-GAAP net income for the year was $282 million or $0.97 per share. Our non-GAAP EPS includes an effective cash tax rate of 4.5%. Below the 11% we guided, as we were able to take advantage of a couple one-time strategic cash tax planning opportunities in the quarter.
As we've mentioned in the past, we believe in a balanced approach to operating the business, one that delivers strong and durable performance on both the top and bottom line. This approach approves to be even more important as we navigate the rapidly evolving macro backdrop where the resiliency and predictability of our business model shines through.
Turning to the balance sheet. As of March 31, we had $555 million of cash and zero debt. Our free cash flow was $115 million in the fourth quarter and $333 million for the full-year or 29% of revenue, exceeding the high-end of our guidance by $12 million. As a reminder, our full-year free cash flow was positively impacted by a one-time tax refund of approximately $35 million in the first quarter. Excluding the tax refund, normalized free cash flow would have been approximately 26%.
The last financial measure that I would like to discuss is our remaining performance obligation RPO. RPO was just under $2 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of 28% over Q4 of last year. The current portion of RPO, which we expect to recognize as revenue over the four quarters was approximately $1.1 billion, an increase of 27% year-over-year. It is important to remember that seasonality associated with bookings and contract upselling will cause variability in the RPO growth rates. And as such, we believe ARR is the best metric to understand the health and durability of the business as it removes noise associated with the timing of billings.
Now let me turn to guidance. We are confident in the long-term growth opportunity for Dynatrace. We believe the addressable market is large and growing, the observability ecosystem is expanding. The demand environment remains healthy. Our product has proven to be highly differentiated and our financial model is balanced and durable. Near-term, we are mindful of the current macro uncertainty. And while we've seen signs of resiliency in the observability market, we believe it's prudent to continue to factor the dynamic macro landscape into our guidance. Enterprises continue to be cautious in their spending and our approach to guidance assumes the tighter budget scrutiny and elongation of sales cycles we experienced in the back half of last fiscal year will persist through fiscal 2024.
There are a few things to keep in mind with respect to our guidance. First, new logos and net retention rate continue to be the building blocks for future growth in the business. We believe we have the right foundation in place to grow new logos in the low-single-digits and maintain a dollar-based net retention rate in the mid-teens for fiscal 2024. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect roughly one-third of net new ARR for the full-year to come from new logos and two-thirds is going to come from expansion.
Second, with more than 40% of our business denominated in foreign currency, continued weakening of the U.S. dollar creates a modest tailwind on ARR and revenue. Based on foreign exchange rates as of April 30, 2023, we expect the FX tailwind to ARR and revenue to be roughly $10 million and $13 million respectively for fiscal 2024. And with respect to Q1, we anticipate the tailwind to be roughly $7 million to ARR and an immaterial impact on revenue.
Third, as we mentioned in the past, the headwind associated with the wind down of perpetual license is now less than 100 basis point impact. To simplify our ARR reporting moving forward, we will no longer be referring to adjusted ARR growth in our prepared remarks. ARR guidance will be provided on an as reported dollar basis and growth rates will be in constant currency. For comparison purposes, we will continue to provide the perpetual headwind detail in our quarterly presentation and in the financial data trends file available on our website.
And the final point I'd like to highlight relates to expected increases in cash income taxes and the impact on our fiscal 2024 free cash flow. Given the increasing strength of our profitability, we have fully utilized our NOLs and tax credit carry forwards and we will be a full cash taxpayer. As such, we expect a significant increase in our effective cash tax rate and related cash taxes in fiscal 2024.
And with that as an opener, let's start with our guidance for the full-year with growth rates in constant currency. We expect ARR to be between $1.475 billion and $1.490 billion, representing an ARR growth of 18% to 19%. And as I mentioned earlier, this growth rate no longer excludes the headwind associated with perpetual license wind down. At the high-end of guidance, this assumes net new ARR $243 million on an as reported basis. And while we don't guide to ARR on a quarterly basis, we did want to provide you with some color in terms of how we expect net new ARR to come in throughout the year.
As I mentioned earlier, we had an exceptional close to Q4 of fiscal 2023, which included roughly $13 million of expansions from early renewals expected in the first quarter. As such, the seasonality of net new ARR will be a bit more back-end loaded this year, compared to prior years with roughly 35% landing in the first-half of fiscal 2024 and 65% in the back half.
Turning now to revenue, we expect total revenue for the full-year to be $1.388 billion to $1.406 billion, up 19% to 20% year-over-year. Underlying that, subscription revenue is expected to be $1.311 billion and $1.327 billion, up 20% to 21% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be between $348 million and $358 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 25% to 25.5% for the year. At the high-end, this represents a 25 basis point margin improvement over fiscal ‘23.
We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.98 to $1.02 per share based on roughly 300 million to 301 million shares outstanding. Our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS calculations assume a non-GAAP effective cash tax rate of 19%, due to the notable uptick in cash taxes that I mentioned earlier. We expect free cash flow to be between $303 million to $312 million or approximately 22% of revenue. This is roughly 400 basis points below our normalized fiscal 2023 levels exclusively, driven by the projected increase in our tax rate from 4.5% to 19% in fiscal 2024.
The anticipated free cash flow impact from the tax rate increase is approximately $60 million. Free tax free cash flow is expected to grow during fiscal 2024. As a reminder, due to seasonality and variability in billings, we expect higher free cash flow in the first and fourth quarters and significantly lower free cash flow in the second and third quarters.
Looking now at Q1, we expect total revenue to be between $325 million and $328 million or 22% to 23% growth. Subscription revenue is expected to be between $306 million and $309 million, up 23% to 24% year-over-year.
From a profit standpoint, non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $76.5 million and $78.5 million or 23.5% to 24% of revenue. From a seasonality perspective, we tend to see a dip in Q1 and Q4 operating margins, due to our annual sales kick off payroll tax resets, and our perform customer conference. Lastly, non-GAAP EPS is expected to be approximately $0.22 per share. Based on a share count of approximately 296 million to 297 million shares.
In summary, we are very pleased with our fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 performance. We have a strong track record of consistent execution. And as we have continued to demonstrate, we are committed to maintaining a disciplined and balanced approach to optimizing costs and improving efficiency and profitability, while continuing to invest in future growth opportunities that we expect will drive long-term value.
And with that, we will open the line for questions. Operator? Thank you. We’ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Mike Cikos from Needham & Company. Your line is now live. Hi, team. Thanks for getting me on here. And I just wanted to circle up on a couple of items. Appreciate all the color on the guidance too. But on the ARR that you guys delivered and I know that you had cited the early renewals in Q4 here? When I think about the $13 million that came in Q4 that was earlier than expected expansion, those early renewals. Is that in any way tied to customers co-terming licenses and I guess where I'm going with that is how much is that being influenced by potentially customers adopting DPS? Thank you. I'll take that, Mike, that's a good question. The $13 million is more as you can imagine that we're in our fiscal year-end. And sales is certainly incented to try to close as much business as possible. And you happen to have customers that are close to their renewals in the first quarter. And in some cases, they were going to be doing expansions anyways, and what we found was we had situations where customers were ready to expand. And we had already had the engagement with the customer and we were able to close it a little bit earlier. So it's nothing more than that. So it's not really a matter of more DPS or anything like that, it’s just literally just some customers that renewed early and had some pretty significant expansions associated with them. Terrific. Thank you for the color on that. And while we're on the subject I guess I'll just use my follow-up on DPS. Can you help us think about the number of customers that are currently non-DPS or what are the early findings as far as how customers are using your platform more broadly once they're on DPS? What are you guys seeing? Because I know that you had called out you envision this being an ARR accelerant over time. Is there any evidence of that with the customers that have adopted this at the earlier stages? And thank you again. Hi, Mike, it's Rick. So we now are up from where we were last ordered about 100 customers on DPS, which were the really the largest customers to already about 130, that continues to grow and we expect to grow over the course of FY 2024. By many, many 100s. The feedback from customers on DPS is very strong and we do see it as ARR accretionary as we look at. And by the way, we've seen good evidence of this in the existing installed base at DPS customers, so that we've had on the platform using DPS for some time. Thank you very much. Thank you. Next question today is coming from Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Great. Thanks for taking my questions guys. Congrats on a really strong quarter. Rick, maybe to start with you, you know, you spend a little bit of time in the prepared remarks talking about generative AI being a tailwind to the platform. I guess I'm wondering from sort of a more holistic perspective, can you talk about the long-term monetization strategy there? I mean what -- how would we see it show up perhaps in ARR growth in the future? Thanks, Matt. It is a fascinating time to be in technology is what I would say at the outset. Generative AI from our point of view is really all about productivity, whether writing text or developing code, whatever it might be, and we see it over the long haul as being upwards of a 10 times multiplier in software development efficiency. So given that, that's going to drive a huge number of additional applications. It's going to drive more cloud migration, more workloads, more compute. And the result of that is we see it being a tailwind for observability solutions such as ours, especially those with deep automation analytics. Our platform as I mentioned in the prepared remarks is already available to handle these workloads. And by handling these workloads today, it's going to be generated through additional compute cycles and additional elements to observe.
The other thing I would say just too quick, maybe additional points on this since I figured this would be a key question. First, generative AI and causal AI, which is the brand of AI that we deliver are highly, highly synergistic. So the causal AI from Dynatrace delivers precise answers and automation from data in real time at scale. And at our perform conference, we announced a new capability called Chat DQL, which is for our Dynatrace query language. What this does is enable customers to use natural language to write DQL queries. So by doing that, we're really bridging the two capabilities together to make the Dynatrace platform more accessible to more users to get more insights out of the causal AI that we deliver. So hopefully that helps provide a bit of color. It does, great. Then maybe just a quick one for Jim. The guidance commentary was super helpful. I guess the one other thing I was wondering about is how are you thinking about sales capacity this year? I mean, normally you've had a pretty programmatic view on how you think about adding capacity, but just any color there would be helpful. Thanks, guys. No. Yes that's a great question, I'll start with we had a fantastic finish to the year and as we enter fiscal ‘24, we're actually in a really good position relative to the tenure of our sales organization. So a tenure of our reps that are two-plus years, it is very, very high. So we're in a good position. So we got tenured reps and you can expect that we will continue to add capacity probably in the mid to high-teens this year and it will probably be a little bit more back end loaded, Matt, because obviously we are living in, kind of, an uncertain macro environment, so we're going to be moderate in the way we increase capacity based on the demand that we see. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Vinod Srinivasaraghavan from Barclays. Your line is now live. Hi, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. You spoke a bit about this, but can you talk a little bit more about the rollout of Grail, how customers are experimenting and starting to deploy it as it really does seem like a unique data storage to capture and analyze data for both observability and the security use cases? Thanks. Sure, Vinod. Let me take that one. The Grail, remember, is simply an underlying core technology that we use in the platform as a data store that is a massively parallel processing data lake house. And what it does is it enables the aggregation of data, whether they be logs, traces, routes, metrics, our sSmartscape topology map, et cetera. That then enables us to monetize that through the sale of very separate modules, all of which use Grail as an underlying platform element, but first and foremost of those being log management. So the example that I used was a case where we've already got a customer doing mid-seven figures of ARR on log management, which, of course, uses underlying that Grail, so that's the way to think about it. Thanks. Appreciate that. And then I think Grail was initially available on AWS. When do you expect it to be available on all of the hyperscalers? We continue to work to deliver that, and we expect that we'll deliver that on the next platform over FY ‘24. Thanks. Thank you. Your next question today is coming from Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Thank you very much. Congratulations on the results. I was wondering, Rick, if you could give us your perspective. The mix of business, certainly maybe because of DPS, is becoming less APM-centric and more broadly diversified. Can you talk about the shift in the business and how the go to market and product organizations are allowing to increase the sources of revenue the company gets?
And also one for Jim on DPS. The early cohort of customers, what has been your analysis as to the increased revenue uptake, although early it might be relative to the previous levels of consumption of the Dynatrace platform? Thank you so much, congratulations. Thanks, Kash. We see the evolution of the platform and our sales model as being really quite notable in terms of the move from where we were a year ago landing around 50% of new logos on multiple modules, which we consider to be three or more modules, and that number is now up to 65%. So when we've got new customers that are coming in, wanting more of the platform, we think it is strong evidence that they want not just APM from Dynatrace. But they want APM, they want infrastructure. They want application security, digital experience management for real-time user feedback. So the net of that is we will expect to see an ongoing evolution toward accessing the platform through one or more of the use cases I described in the prepared remarks. But then ultimately, the destination for most of them is really to use the entire platform over the course of time. Yes. And the added color on what have we seen? I would say it's early days. As Rick said, we have roughly 130 customers. They tend to be our largest customers. And we see very, very healthy expansion with those customers. And to Rick's point, as you more broadly roll it out, it's just a vehicle to make a much more frictionless purchase experience and leverage more of the Dynatrace platform. So in that regard, we just think it's a much better vehicle for customers to grow and expand on the platform. Maybe, Kash, just to provide a little bit more color on DPS and also for those others on the call, the opportunity around DPS is really quite enormous, because this is what customers are asking us for. They have wanted us to deploy a model where they have a single commit that spans the entire platform, and that's precisely what we've delivered with DPS. So single commit, you can use application security, you can deploy log management, you can do trials, you can deploy them, all of this with your single contract that is under DPS. So this is why it really is fueling very strong interest in customers to move to this model and why we've enabled it really across the customer base. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Andrew Nowinski from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Great, thank you. Congrats on another great quarter and a great close to the fiscal year. I just have two quick questions for you. I guess I wanted to ask about the Grail in the SaaS platform. How much of a revenue or an ARR uplift are you seeing from customers that move from on-prem to your Grail-based SaaS platform? Let me take that. I would say that it varies, but we see roughly a 10% uplift when customers go from kind of a managed to a SaaS platform. 10%, okay. Thank you. And then I wanted to ask about your operating margin. So you mentioned, I think, Rick, you said you expect modest margin expansion in fiscal ‘24, but you guided margins flat at 25%, so I'm wondering if you could just put some guardrails around what you consider modest expansion and also whether you have any long-term targets for operating margin that we could think about? Thanks. Yes. I mean, so we landed in fiscal ‘23 at around 25%, and we guided 25% to 25.5%. So at the high end of the range, what I said is that that's probably about a 25 bp improvement in margins. As you can imagine, as a reminder, obviously, we are a rare breed of company that has balanced growth and profitability, having growth in the 20s, in margins in the low to mid-20s. So we think we're in a really, really good place.
I think there's a significant opportunity for margin expansion long-term for the company. We're going to be having an Investor Day here probably in the future. We haven't set a date yet, and we'll provide more insight on where we think maybe a long-term model could be for op margins. But you should expect that we think there's significant room for accretion in the operating model. It's obviously about rate and pace, when do you do that and how do you balance it based on the opportunities that you see in front of you. Super. Thank you, guys. Thank you. Next question is coming from Koji Ikeda from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Thanks, Rick and Jim for taking the questions. I wanted to ask another question on Grail. And we've been hearing from partners that initial testing and proof of concepts have been going pretty well, and really the next step is demonstrating the ability to scale to similar levels to the competition out there, specifically in enterprise log analytics. So I was wondering if you could share some of your thoughts on Grail, maybe its ability to scale to the largest workloads. And what specifically from a technology perspective for Grail gives you that confidence? Maybe I'm just simply under-appreciating the power of Grail's parallel processing like house. Thanks, guys. Koji, we already have a customer doing 100 terabytes or more of storage in real time on Grail. So we think we've already proven that scale, and we are fusing it broadly. So we now have well over 300 POCs, that's more than double where we were last quarter this time, and customers are very interested, as I said, in the earlier remarks on testing Grail as a mechanism towards both reducing the log management costs, as well as increasing its effectiveness. Got it. Thanks, Rick. And maybe just a follow-up. In the prepared remarks, the commentary on the potential AI tailwinds sounded pretty bullish, and I was just wondering, just to be super clear here on the FY ‘24 guide, is there any embedded tailwinds from AI in the guidance? Or -- and if there is, could you please quantify that magnitude? Thanks, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Right, Koji. No embedded tailwind in AI. This is new. It's exciting. It's rapidly developing. We think it's going to result in added workloads as we discussed. But there's nothing embedded in the FY ‘24 guide for generative AI. Thank you, Rick. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Thank you. Next question today is coming from Will Power from Baird. Your line is now live. Great. Rick, just want to circle back on generative AI. And appreciate the comments and color earlier on some of the monetization opportunities. I wonder how you're also thinking about generative AI in terms of driving efficiencies in your own underlying businesses. What do the opportunities look like on that front? Will, it's a really good question. The short answer is that just as we expect our customers to gain productivity as a result of large language models, LLMs, as well as generative AI, we expect to do the same. In addition, I mentioned the announcement of Perform around chat DQL. This is really exciting. Imagine if you're a user of the Dynatrace platform today, you have to write DQL queries.
Now the good news is this is a very common language and our end users have this capability in spade, so that's great. But imagine that we can provide that to be even more accessible by using natural language to query the Dynatrace platform. Very, very exciting and extending the Dynatrace platform to more end users.
And then lastly, imagine if you were using one of the hyperscalers, AI -- generative AI platforms and that you can actually use that to query the Dynatrace data using causal AI, also a strong extension of the platform. So these are some of the areas in which we could imagine this evolving. Okay, I appreciate that. And maybe just as a follow-up, kind of, sticking with the automation analytics theme coming out of your user conference, a big focus on automation engine, app engine. I wonder any other -- any early color you could provide in terms of customer interest and progress on those fronts? The way that I would answer that, Will, is that we really do see FY ‘24 as the year of adoption. So we are really driving through our customer success team, our services teams, their SEs and other trials, POCs, deployment of these capabilities, because we think that it makes the Dynatrace platform dramatically more valuable to customers. Obviously, from our standpoint, it creates more stickiness, more ARR generation, all of those elements as well.
But the primary value is really to the customer, and that's where we're focused on driving these kinds of POCs. On App Engine, automation engine and others, very good early returns in POCs. Too early to really say too much more about it, but excited with the early returns. Thank you. Thank you. Next question today is coming from Pinjalim Bora from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Oh, great, hey. Congrats on the quarter. Rick, I want to ask you about the DXC and the Deloitte comment that you made. It seems like Dynatrace is becoming part of the reference architectures. Do you see Dynatrace more and more becoming embedded for application development, holistically impacting how applications are developed and how any changes to the application impacts the entire stack? And as that evolves, does that kind of up levels the opportunity for Dynatrace? Two answers to the question. First of all, with respect to the GSIs, becoming part of the reference architecture is really core and a major first step toward making sure that when the GSIs do a digital transformation project, a cloud migration and so forth, that they are thinking about Dynatrace. Because after all, we really do see Dynatrace an opportunity to make cloud and sanitations work better. And the result of that is that we expect that the clients of those GSIs will see the same, and the GSIs engagement with us is very productive in that regard. So that is a key element of the GSI story. So let me leave it at that for now. Understood. I wanted to double click on the DPS accelerant to ARR comment. Can you explain that? Is that largely driven by, kind of, the higher expansion dynamics that you might be seeing when do you see DPS start making an impact to ARR numbers? When do we see that over the next two, three years? Well, we've already seen that in the existing DPS customers. They tend to have higher ARR accretion than non-DPS customers. So we already do see that value to existing EPS customers today. The way that this works is that it creates just a more frictionless expansion opportunity by avoiding additional contracting for new modules, like for example, if I've got APM them and infrastructure, and I don't have to come contract for AppSec or log management, I can just extend those within my existing contract. It creates less friction. Got it. Thank you. Thank you. Next question today is coming from Keith Bachman from BMO. Your line is noe live. Hui, many thanks. The first question, I want to revert back to Grail is what do you think the penetration rate will be on Grail? So for instance, we talk to a large customer. So it's inevitable, they will adopt Grail, because of the way the data set models work relative to the application usage. And so just wondering how you think the adoption trends will unfold? I know you said there's been a significant increase, I think, 300 customers versus 150 last quarter. But where do you see this ending up?
And when you referenced POC, what did you mean by the customers have signed a POC in terms of what was the monetization impact? And I have a follow-up, please. Well, I'll just ask my follow-up now. If you could give some update on where security is in terms of adoption kind of run rate, that would be great. Many thanks. Well, Keith, on the question of POCs, this means that customers are deploying POCs. They're using it in trial environments headed to production environments and testing it out, so that's that piece. With respect to the security piece, we -- as we said, we have 400 customers now on security, that's about 10% penetration to our installed base. We continue to expect that to grow and penetration to increase to the point where we said that we expected to do $100 million over a three-year span that gets us there by the end of FY ‘25. We continue to expect that outcome.
And then lastly, with regard to Grail deployment, this is a very important question, because we expect rail, just to be very clear, again, is underlying core technology to be present in 100% of our installed base over the course of time. Log management using Grail won't necessarily be 100%, but Grail is simply an underlying data store. And that data store will be used across the entire platform. Okay, yes. That’s exactly where I was getting to. Many thanks. Thank you. We reached the end of our question -- actually, our final question today is coming from Gray Powell from BTIG. Your line is now live. Great, thank you for squeezing me in. I'll be quick. So yes, just following up on the security question. What's the typical ASP uplift you get for a customer that take security? And then on the $100 million target by the end of fiscal ‘25, just how should we think about the linearity to get there? Thank you. Yes. I think, obviously, the uplift on -- if you're talking about AppSec, the uplift on AppSec obviously varies based on the size of the customer, so it's hard to just give you a generic response, because of the way we've kind of positioned it. So I can tell you that you can expect in general that at least based on customers that have a reasonable ARR, it's probably a 10% uplift. Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back over for any further or closing comments. Okay. Well, thank you all very much. In closing, we are very, very pleased with the finish to fiscal ‘23. We're very bullish about the opportunity that lies ahead, as you can tell. Thank you all for your engaged questions, as well as for your ongoing support. We look forward to connecting with you at upcoming IR events over the coming weeks, and we wish you all a very good day. Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.","a question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation . it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to noelle Faris, vice president of Investor Relations . the forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's views on May 17, 2023 .",1.0

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Noelle Faris, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Noelle. You may begin. Good morning, and thank you for joining Dynatrace's First Quarter and Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Rick McConnell, Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Chief Financial Officer.
Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements such as statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance and economic conditions. Actual results may differ materially from our expectations due to a number of risks and uncertainties discussed in Dynatrace's SEC filings, including our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q that we filed earlier today. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's views on August 2, 2023. We assume no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information, future events or circumstances. Unless otherwise noted, the growth rates we discuss today are non-GAAP, reflecting constant currency growth and per share amounts are on a diluted basis.
We will also discuss other non-GAAP financial measures on today's call. We provide reconciliations between non-GAAP and GAAP measures in today's earnings press release and in the financial presentation slides posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. And with that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Rick McConnell. Rick? Thanks, Noelle, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for today's call. We had a solid start to our fiscal year, exceeding the high end of our guidance across all metrics. ARR grew 25% year-over-year. Subscription revenue increased 27% year-over-year in constant currency and non-GAAP operating income was $92 million or 28% of revenue. These results continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver a powerful combination of top line growth and profitability. They are a testament to the criticality of observability and application security in the market and the significant value our platform provides to our customers even as the economic environment continues to impact buying behavior.
Jim will share more details about our Q1 performance in a moment. In the meantime, I'd like to share an update on the broader market outlook, customer wins and recent announcements. Let's start with our market opportunity, which we continue to view as massive and growing. As organizations increasingly rely on multi-cloud and cloud-native computing for successful execution of their digital transformation strategies, simplification through observability has become essential. The scale and dynamic nature of modern cloud ecosystems have made them too complex to manage with dashboards, alerts and manual troubleshooting.
Organizations are frustrated with fragmented tools, negative customer experiences and limited analytics. Dynatrace makes order out of this chaos by enabling customers to have better control of their IT ecosystems and to help combat these pain points. Last quarter, I mentioned several use cases that have become key drivers of customers' purchasing behavior among them, organizations purchase Dynatrace because they're looking to deliver highly performing cloud-native infrastructure and applications.
They're seeking cost-effective and more insightful log management at scale. They're investing substantial sums to secure their cloud applications. They want to dramatically reduce incidents and downtime. And they're seeking a fully unified observability platform to help drive material cost savings and improved oversight by consolidating the myriad of disconnected tools they're using today. These use cases helped drive new logo growth of 15% in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis and led to a dollar-based net retention of 116%.
Some notable customer wins from this quarter include the following: A leading financial software company signed a 7-figure deal through the Azure portal. This customer is in the process of modernizing their environment from legacy virtual machines to Kubernetes. The time and cost associated with triaging incidents and manual troubleshooting in a modern complex environment was a major pain point for them. Now with full stack observability and logs on Grail with Dynatrace, this customer estimates they will save $1.5 million in the first 3 months of deployment due to greater efficiency, productivity and higher collaboration across teams.
Another 7-figure win in the quarter was with one of the largest satellite television providers. This customer was overwhelmed with the number of alerts and manual troubleshooting their existing monitoring tool provided. They were looking to simplify and reduce inefficiencies as well as get visibility into every aspect of their cloud environment with no blind spots. They have now chosen to standardize on Dynatrace. And a major U.S. oil and gas company signed a significant expansion to add application security to their deployment. After the log for shelf software vulnerability was identified, they realized they didn't have visibility into what vulnerabilities were either unresolved or reintroduced into their environment.
With Dynatrace AppSec, they now have better visibility into their applications and we're able to integrate DevOps with DevSecOps. These are just a few examples of the strength of our product offering and the business value that Dynatrace platform provides. As we have often said in the past, we strive to enable our customers to deliver flawless and secure digital interactions. The analytics and automation embedded in our unified observability and security platform are what differentiate us in the market and frequently drive customers to choose Dynatrace over alternative approaches.
Last month, after evaluating 19 vendors, Gartner named Dynatrace, a leader in the 2023 Magic Quadrant for application performance monitoring and observability, positioning Dynatrace furthest for completeness of vision and highest for ability to execute. This was the 13th straight time that Dynatrace has been in the leader quadrant. We were also ranked #1 across all 6 use cases in the Gartner 2023 critical capabilities for APM and observability report. We believe Dynatrace's position, longevity and criticality in both reports reflect our ability to execute and anticipate change in this constantly evolving market.
I'd like to turn next to 2 key announcements we made over the past couple of weeks in the areas of hypermodal AI and developer observability, both of which are great examples of our core focus on innovation.
First, let's start with hypermodal AI evolving from a radically different approach to artificial intelligence. Dynatrace Davis is our AI engine that has long been a primary differentiator for us. Dynatrace customers have used Davis AI for years to tie server side observability with user impact, deterministically reduce hundreds of alerts to single problems, and automate the root cause analysis process in large scale and complex cloud native environments. We've extended our causal AI to security use cases such as automating risk analysis of vulnerabilities and accelerating investigations and remediation. And we've made our predictive AI more powerful by leveraging machine learning to identify anomalies and forecast future patterns with great precision based on historical behavior.
Last year, we extended our predictive AI and causal AI capabilities with even richer context leveraging our Grail Data Lake house, extracting precise answers and driving automation from data in real time at massive scale. Last week, we announced the planned addition of a third critical element to our AI architecture and solution set, generative AI to deliver the industry's first hypermodal artificial intelligence observability offering. Hypermodal AI is the combination of 3 different AI techniques delivered by Dynatrace, each having a unique value but with a whole much greater than the sum of the parts. Predictive AI uses models to recommend future actions based on data from the past. Causal AI analyzes dependencies across massive data sets while retaining an accurate context to deliver fact-based, precise answers and automation.
And generative AI provides recommendations on how to solve specific tasks through prompts enriched with automated context of a customer's environment uniquely provided by Dynatrace. Our generative AI capability is named Davis copilot. Davis copilot will work with Dynatrace causal and predictive AI to automatically provide recommendations for issue remediation and optimization, create actions and allow people to use natural language to explore, solve or complete tasks. Many organizations have announced strategies around generative AI. Our approach, however, goes far beyond simply adding a natural language interface that relies on human intelligence to steer generative AI solutions. Our predictive and causal AI will be designed to feed comprehensive and specific prompts to Davis copilot to help avoid outages or degradations before they happen and help remediate and resolve active incidents when they arise.
We view hypermodal AI as a significant catalyst for customer expansion, increasing both the breadth of end users who can leverage the platform and the creation of workloads. We believe this will lead to higher dollar-based net retention resulting from more customer cross-sell and upsell as well as an increase in the stickiness of the Dynatrace platform.
We're also very excited about the ongoing evolution of our platform in the area of developer observability. As we have indicated in the past, we believe that the role of development teams will continue to expand in the observability and application security decision process. In particular, we believe these capabilities will continue to shift left into software development life cycles to enable more productive handling of observability insights and answers directly in software. And that, in turn, will lead development teams to shift right to take on greater responsibility for successful software operations, including availability and end user experience.
This week, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Rookout, a Tel Aviv-based developer-first observability platform to further expand our capabilities and investment in this area. In particular, code debugging in production environments has been a major pain point for developers. Traditionally, debugging tools have only addressed issues in preproduction environments, leading developers without an efficient or secure way to troubleshoot production applications. Rookout's highly differentiated technology allows developers to address issues in live code with privacy controls in place without restarting, redeploying or adding even more code. We believe the combination of Rookout's debugging technology seamlessly integrated into the Dynatrace platform will be very powerful for our customers.
We expect it to create a new standard for how engineers improve code quality and deliver better business outcomes by enabling developers to troubleshoot and debug without disruption. In addition to these exciting announcements on product innovation and platform evolution, we've also had some noteworthy announcements on the go-to-market side of the business. Two weeks ago, we announced the expansion of our relationship with Microsoft. We're stepping up our committed spend over a multiyear horizon in anticipation of even more growth through the Azure platform. Together, it will be increasing our joint sales enablement and marketing to accelerate cloud migration and optimization initiatives.
Earlier in the quarter, we announced the expansion of our collaboration with Red Hat with new integration capabilities between Dynatrace and Red Hat Event-driven Ansible. This is a great example of how Dynatrace turns data into answers that can then be turned into actions. This integration enables customers to automate DevSecOps use cases, such as closed-loop remediation and application healing to drive greater operational efficiencies and boost the performance, reliability and security of their workloads. And we continue to build momentum with a leading strategic global system integrators or GSIs. We have more than 10 strategic GSIs partnering with us today and a few, including Deloitte and DXC have built Dynatrace into their reference architectures.
By way of example, sales pipeline contribution from one of our largest GSI partners has more than doubled when compared to last year and continues to show strong momentum. Before I turn the call over to Jim, I'd like to take a moment to discuss our CRO transition.
In June, we announced the appointment of Dan Zugelder as our new CRO. Dan is 4 weeks into his role at Dynatrace, and we're extremely pleased to have him on board. Dan brings deep industry knowledge, having spent his career working at ADP, Dell EMC and most recently, VMware. He has a strong background in building multibillion dollar sales organizations which will be instrumental as Dynatrace plans to scale in our next phase of growth.
On behalf of the entire Dynatrace team, I'd like to thank Steve Pace for his dedication and execution as our CRO over the past 7 years. His contributions to building a world-class sales organization have positioned Dynatrace for sustainable long-term growth. Steve will be retiring from Dynatrace in early October, and he is actively involved in ensuring a smooth transition.
In closing, we had a solid start to a fiscal year even as ongoing macro headwinds persist. We remain highly confident in our market opportunity, our platform leadership and the powerful combination of top line growth and profitability. We're humbled by the third-party validation from Gartner of our product leadership and we're committed to continuing our delivery of significant innovations and customer value consistent with that leadership.
Financially, we will continue to manage our business prudently and invest thoughtfully in those strategic opportunities that we believe put us in a position of strength for the future. We're purposeful and driven by our vision of enabling our customers to deliver a world in which their software works perfectly. We have made great progress, but in the context of an increasingly cloud-based software world in which we can materially improve software performance and end user engagement, we have really only just begun.
With that, let me turn the call over to Jim. Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As Rick mentioned, we're off to a solid start to our fiscal year beating the high end of our guidance across all of our key operating metrics. Our continued ability to successfully execute in this dynamic macro environment is a testament to the growing criticality of observability and application security in the market, our product differentiation, the value proposition we provide to our customers and the ongoing durability of our business model.
Now let's dive into the first quarter results in more detail. Please note that the growth rates mentioned will be year-over-year and in constant currency, unless otherwise stated. Starting with annual recurring revenue. As a reminder, the headwind associated with the wind down of perpetual license is now less than 100 basis points. As I mentioned last quarter, we will no longer be referring to adjusted ARR growth in our prepared remarks. For comparison purposes, we will continue to share the impact of perpetual license in our quarterly presentation and in the financial data trends file available on our website.
Total ARR for the first quarter was $1.29 billion, an increase of $263 million year-over-year and $47 million sequentially. Foreign exchange was a $3 million tailwind year-over-year and a $10 million tailwind sequentially resulting in 25% year-over-year ARR growth on a constant currency basis. Net new ARR on a constant currency basis was $37 million in our seasonally lightest bookings quarter of the year. And as we shared in our last call, we had a tremendous close to Q4 of fiscal '23 which included $13 million of incremental expansions from early renewals that we originally expected to close in the first quarter.
New logos grew 15% in the first quarter adding a total of 155 new logos to the Dynatrace platform. The average ARR per new logo land was consistent with the prior quarter at roughly $130,000 on a trailing 12-month basis. Our gross retention rates continue to be best-in-class in the mid-90s and contributed to a solid dollar-based net retention rate of 116% in the first quarter, in line with our mid-teens expectation for fiscal 2024. With nearly 2/3 of our customers using 3 or more modules, it's clear that customers are standardizing on Dynatrace as their full stack observability and security platform. Our innovation engine continues to home, creating additional cross-sell and upsell opportunities in our customer base.
As Rick mentioned, hypermodal AI and developer observability are great examples of building incremental capabilities to extend our reach to a wider range of users and accelerate the pace and volume of new workloads, which we believe will ultimately contribute to an incremental expansion in the future. In addition, we're seeing strong customer interest for the Dynatrace Platform Subscription or DPS, having made it generally available to customers in April. With DPS, we're making our solutions set broadly and easily accessible through a simplified cross-platform licensing model. This model allows customers to trial and deploy any aspect of our solutions, such as logs or AppSec, while leveraging a single commitment. We expect DPS will drive enhanced net expansion and accelerate ARR in future periods.
Moving on to revenue. Total revenue for the first quarter was $333 million, up 25% and exceeding the high end of guidance by $5 million and subscription revenue for the first quarter was $316 million, up 27%  and exceeding the high end of our guidance range by $7 million. With respect to margins, we continue to have a very healthy margin profile, reflecting the value and efficiency of the Dynatrace platform. Non-GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was 84%, consistent with both last year and Q4 levels. Our non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $92 million, $40 million above the high end of our guidance range due to the revenue upside in the quarter and a staggered pace of hiring in anticipation of the Rookout acquisition. This resulted in a non-GAAP operating margin of 28%, exceeding the top end of the guidance range by roughly 400 basis points. Non-GAAP net income was $79 million or $0.27 per share. This was $0.05 above the high end of our guidance range, driven by the items I just mentioned.
Turning now to the balance sheet. As of June 30, we had $701 million of cash and 0 debt. This represents a sequential increase in our cash balance of $145 million compared to March 31. Our free cash flow was a very healthy $124 million in the first quarter. We continue to believe it is best to view free cash flow over a trailing 12-month period due to seasonality and variability in billings quarter-to-quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow was $321 million or 26% of revenue. The last financial measure that I would like to discuss is our remaining performance obligation.
RPO was approximately $1.9 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of 20% over Q1 of last year. The current portion of RPO, which we expect to recognize revenue over the next 4 quarters was $1.97 billion, an increase of 24%. It is important to remember that seasonality associated with bookings and contract upselling will cause variability in the RPO growth rates. As such, we continue to believe ARR is the best metric to understand the health and durability of the business as it removes noise associated with the timing of billings.
Now let me turn to guidance. As Rick mentioned, we're confident in the long-term growth opportunity for Dynatrace. The addressable market is large and growing. Observability and application security are becoming even more critical to successful cloud and multi-cloud deployments. Our offerings are highly differentiated. We're well positioned as the industry leader, and we have a financial model that is both balanced and durable. Near term, we're mindful of the current macro uncertainty. And while we have seen signs of resiliency in the observability and application security market, we believe it is prudent to continue to factor the dynamic macro landscape into our guidance.
Enterprises remain cautious in their spending, and our approach to guidance assumes that tighter budget scrutiny and elongation of sales cycles will persist. We had a solid start to the year, but it is still early in our fiscal year, and we do not want to get ahead of ourselves. There are a few things to keep in mind with respect to our guidance. This guidance continues to assume new logo growth in the low single digits and a dollar-based net retention rate in the mid-teens for fiscal 2024. We expect the full year foreign exchange tailwind to as reported ARR to be approximately $11 million and approximately $15 million on revenue, roughly consistent with our prior guidance.
The Rookout acquisition is expected to close within the second quarter and is embedded in our guidance. As this is a technology tuck-in acquisition, there is insignificant revenue as part of this transaction. However, we believe the combination of Rookout's code debugging technology seamlessly integrated into the unified Dynatrace platform will be very powerful and address a major developer pain. And with that as an opener, let's start with our guidance for the full year with growth rates in constant currency.
We're maintaining our ARR guidance of $1.475 billion to $1.49 billion or 18% to 19% constant currency growth. Consistent with what I shared last quarter, the seasonality of net new ARR is expected to be more back-end loaded this year compared to prior years, with roughly 35% expected to land in the first half of fiscal 2024 and approximately 65% in the back half.
Turning now to revenue. We're raising our revenue guidance at the midpoint by $11 million for the year, driven by our overachievement in subscription revenue in the first quarter. We expect total revenue to be between $1.4 billion and $1.415 billion or 20% to 21% growth, up 100 basis points from our prior guidance. We're raising our subscription revenue guidance at the midpoint by $15 million for the year as we expect a slightly higher mix of subscription services versus services revenue. Total subscription revenue is expected to be between $1.326 billion to $1.341 billion, representing 21% to 22% growth, up 100 basis points from our prior guidance.
From a profit standpoint, given the revenue increases and ongoing disciplined management of spend, we're raising our non-GAAP operating margin guidance by 50 basis points to a range of 25.5% to 26%. We're raising non-GAAP EPS guidance to $1.03 to $1.06 per share, representing an increase of $0.05 at the midpoint of the range. This non-GAAP EPS is based on a diluted share count of $300 million to $301 million shares and a non-GAAP effective cash tax rate of 19%, consistent with prior guidance.
And finally, we're maintaining our free cash flow guidance of $303 million to $312 million, representing a free cash flow margin of approximately 22% of revenue. And while we do not guide free cash flow quarterly, due to the seasonality and variability in billings as well as the timing of cash tax payments, we expect free cash flow to be higher in our first and fourth quarters and significantly lower in our second and third quarters.
And given our expected back-end loaded bookings linearity this year, free cash flow will be even more skewed to Q4 than prior years. Looking at Q2, we expect total revenue to be between $343 million and $346 million or 21% to 22% growth. Subscription revenue is expected to be between $325 million and $328 million, up 22% to 23% year-over-year. From a profit standpoint, non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $90 million and $93 million or 26% to 27% of revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $0.26 to $0.27 per share.
In summary, we're pleased with our first quarter fiscal 2024 performance. We have a proven track record of consistent execution. And as we have consistently demonstrated, we're committed to maintaining a balanced approach to optimize cost to drive profitability while continuing to invest in future growth opportunities that we expect will drive long-term value.
And with that, we will open up the line for questions. Operator? [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Pinjalim Bora with JPMorgan. Congrats on the quarter. I want to ask you on DPS since you're leaning on DPS this year. What have you seen so far from customer feedback on DPS? Are people kind of able to map their existing spend on DPS? Is there a period of learning? And any way to understand what are the expansion characteristics month-over-month? I think you talked about the point about accelerating ARR because of DPS. I think you said that last quarter as well. I'm just trying to understand any indications that might corroborate that point. Pinjalim. It's Rick. Very early still in DPS rollout. We just went GA in late April but very good momentum already, many dozens of closures of new customers on it. Pipeline continues to grow. And already for new logos, the vast majority of our dollar-based pipeline is coming in DPS. So I would say early, but very good, solid, positive performance on DPS evolution so far. And I'd just add something, Pinjalim, that you mentioned on the expansion side, we've certainly seen for DPS customers that DPS customers have actually shown better expansion rates to non-DPS customers. Now admittedly, some of that is some of our largest customers. So the sample size is a bit skewed, but we're optimistic that DPS is going to be a great contract vehicle to actually drive more expansion. Got it. And one follow-up for you, Jim, on ARR. I'm trying to understand kind of the implied Q2 net new ARR guide, you kind of kept the 35%. And I appreciate that it's early in the year and all that. But it does imply kind of a downtick in net new ARR in Q2 versus Q1 in the growth. I'm trying to understand if you're seeing any kind of -- anything in the business that makes you feel like that net new growth might tick down next quarter? Was there any kind of pull in of deals into Q1 from Q2? Or is there just a little bit more conservatism given kind of the CRO transition? Yes. Well, it's a great question. And I would say that in fairness, that there's -- we maintained the guide for the year because, one, as we had shared that we thought that the seasonality would be a little bit more back-end loaded this year than normal. So 35% in the first half, roughly, and 65% in the second half, had a very solid start to the year, but you're still very early in the year. So we wanted to make sure that we didn't get ahead of ourselves. So we have maintained a level of prudence. One thing I would tell you is that so the demand environment is still pretty solid. But what we have certainly seen, and you saw it in our Q4, which was really, really strong, was that the timing of when you close some deals is really hard to guess. And so especially some large deals that we wanted to make sure we maintain a bit of caution with that because sometimes deals might close a month later, it could be a quarter later.
So we wanted to make sure we acknowledge that given what's going on in the broader environment. So demand trends look good. We certainly have maintained a level of prudence. And as we had shared that more of the business will be back-end loaded, which is kind of makes sense because the majority of our renewal activity happens in the back half of the year, which is where you tend to get a lot of expansions. And so that's really what's driving kind of the broader guide. Our next question is from Mike Cikos with Needham & Company. I appreciate all the disclosures for the guidance. I think my questions are going to be more along the lines of that guidance construction, though. And I just wanted to get a sense for the dollar-based net retention and the $116 million that we're looking at in Q1, is there a thought that we see further erosion of that metric through this year? And then the follow-up, if I could just tack it on now. But I guess, in your view, what helps that net retention climb back from current levels? If we're looking for improvement, what in your view, needs to happen to drive that improvement? Yes. So it's a very good question. So we had shared in our guide last quarter that we thought dollar-based net retention would be in the mid-teens. And so I still expect that. So Q1 came in roughly in line with what we had thought, very, very strong new logo quarter for Q1. I think you saw that we had a 15% growth in new logos with actually a pretty good land size of roughly $130,000. So really strong on the new logo front, and dollar-based net retention in line with our expectations. We do expect that to be hover at the mid-teens level, call it, $1.14 to $1.16 through the year. And what's going to cause an acceleration. I think, one, we're being a bit cautious, given we have seen longer buying cycles, and we've seen expansions as they've gone through the funnel shrink in size as customers maybe split expansions over multiple periods, whereas they used to give us large expansions at once.
So some of the budgetary environment has caused maybe less expansions in the near term. I'll tell you on the positive side, there's a lot more to sell with logs on Grail and other opportunities that we have in the business from a product perspective. So I think near term, we're dealing with some budgetary headwinds. I do think that the portfolio continues to grow. I think the market opportunity continues to grow. So we're quite optimistic that you're going to see a reacceleration in dollar-based net retention. I think we're just being cautious here over the next year. Our next question is from Sterling Auty with MoffettNathanson. I just want to continue on with one question around the macro, just specific. If you can give us a little bit of color in terms of what you experienced at the end of the quarter and now in the beginning of this quarter? And has that changed in any degree versus what you have been experiencing because I think a lot of the commentary you're using matches what's been said through the calendar year. So just wondering if anything's different. And then specifically, the one question we all ask is cloud optimizations and what your sense is about nearing the bottom and kind of getting past that. I guess I'll start and then maybe Rick can comment more on the cloud optimization comment that we really haven't seen Sterling a real change in the macro environment. The macro environment is, I would say, it's been very consistent to be frank, the last 3 quarters. And so it's not better, it's not worse. I'd say it's consistent. But consistent means it is definitely -- deals are taking longer to go through approval cycles, deal sizes kind of are shrinking as they kind of go, especially for expansions. So while the demand environment is healthy, I'd say that as they go through the sales cycle, we're certainly seeing some lengthening. It's not worsening but it's not improving either. And so we've tried to ensure that in our guide, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves that we're -- our expectation is that, that environment will continue. And until we see a change in that, I think it's prudent to have a guide that reflects kind of an uncertain macro environment. And Rick, I don't know if you want to comment on the cloud optimization trends. Right. On cloud optimizations, a couple of quick points. First, as we've said in the past, Sterling, our view is that cloud optimizations really do, in many ways speak to Dynatrace's value-add in the market. So we continue to believe and see that, that we're a solution in many ways to cloud optimizations. We're also less impacted just based on our business model and our approach to pricing. So that's sort of the Dynatrace perspective. overall, my view is that cloud optimizations are beginning to reduce in overall impact in the market. I'm not sure we're at the bottom, but we seem to be making progress toward that end. Our next question is from Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Rick, I just wanted to start with kind of a general question on AI broadly. And just be curious what would be your observations from bleeding edge customers or maybe your relationships with hyperscalers. The question would be, how do the needs of the observability stack change with those types of deployments? Wondering if the attach rate of monitoring software is similar or different than a traditional deployment. And then secondly, how does the competitive landscape differ in bake-offs with those use cases? Thanks, Adam. First on the market in general, I would just say before even getting to generative AI and hypermodal AI and our solution to that, the market continues to show very, very strong evolution. Observability overall continues to be of higher demand, of higher need for our customers due to increased complexity and volume of data and workloads. So that's my overall comment on the market. How does that relate to the AI commentary. The way it relates is that AI and in particular generative AI is going to contribute notably to enabling customers to be more efficient, more productive in their management observability systems.
So the combination of generative AI, along with causal and predictive AI, which collectively, we call hypermodal AI, we believe, to be a mission-critical solution that will catalyze demand over the course of the future by opening up observability to more end users to more people within companies bringing natural language capabilities into the observability framework. But also using the combination of productivity from generative AI with the deterministic capabilities of causal and predictive AI. And collectively, these elements provide substantial value to catalyzing, we think, future demand. Got it. That's helpful. Maybe as a follow-up, I wanted to ask about the Microsoft partnership. And Rick, we hear a lot of competitors talk about working with Microsoft, but this sounds a little bit different and much more strategic. So maybe you could start with just what went into forging that partnership? And Jim, if you could talk about what this means for margin. It sounds like there's some committed costs associated with this. Just curious what it means from a margin perspective, the cost, how variable they are, anything that you can give us around the financial aspect of this partnership. Sure. A very important relationship with Microsoft. As you point out, Adam, a material extension of our commit to them and they're committed back to us on the go-to-market side. So obviously, we just signed it, but we're optimistic about the evolution of it. Jim? Yes. And what I'd say on the financial side, as you can imagine, as Rick said, we're expanding our relationship with them, which means we're expanding our Azure commitment with them from a dollar perspective. So what it's telling you is the signal of strong customer interest of having Dynatrace's business on the Azure platform. And so with that and with an increased commitment, we get much, much more favorable pricing and so the pricing that we get is very consistent with pricing that we get, we'd say, in AWS.
And so customers are now in a situation, and we're in a situation where your pricing is very similar on an Azure platform as well as an AWS platform. So this is something that's going to be, I'd say, enable us to continue to scale on gross margins as we move more and more of the business to SaaS. And so -- the way you should expect it is it will allow us to continue to maintain this very, very healthy gross margin profile kind of in the mid-80s. Our next question is from Andrew Nowinski with Wells Fargo. I want to ask about your GSI partners. I think you said you now have 10 partners signed up and one has a pipeline that's more than doubled year-over-year. Is there anything unique or specific about that partner in their pipeline? And how does that compare to maybe the other 9 partners, the pipeline you have with the other 9 partners? Thanks, Andrew. Appreciate -- I appreciate it, the question. GSIs continue to grow quite notably for us in terms of pipeline even in terms of conversion. So we feel very good about the evolution. The primary takeaway in GSIs is we're playing this for the long game. We do believe that GSIs have become an increasingly material segment of our channel distribution over the course of time. But these deals tend to be quite large in many cases that are coming through digital transformation initiatives, hyper cloud migrations and other types of solutions of that nature. So they're going to take a little bit longer to close. So pipeline is a great leading indicator, which is why we provided that. The statistic we provided on doubling of one of our largest strategic GSIs was just an indicator of that leading indication of that pipeline. Okay. And then I wanted to ask about the new Chief Revenue Officer. Dan has only been in the seat for less than a month, but any early observations about maybe changes to go to market that he plans to implement? Yes. I mean at 4 weeks in, we're not planning on any notable or material changes in our go-to-market strategy. What I would say is that, obviously, we're increasing our focus and intensity around partners. For example, the hyper clouds, also the GSIs. So we're going to continue to lean in, in those particular areas to grow our partner focus, and that's going to be evident in our go-to-market strategy as we evolve. Our next question is from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Rick, I wanted to go to -- back to Grail. It's starting to show up a lot more in partner conversations and they tend to be somewhat larger deals to on the logging side. Can you give us a bit of -- a bit more color on how you're thinking about cross-selling that? What does the pipeline look like for that? And in terms of like areas to maybe reaccelerate NRR, is that -- how do you think about Grail in the context of that? Well, let me sort of separate out Grail from logs on Grail to start, which I tried to do in last quarter's call as well. The first thing is Grail is an underlying core technology in the platform that is used as a massively parallel processing data lake house, if you will. That data store spans traces, logs, routes, metrics, all of the components of data store that we would have. It is initially focused at AWS for SaaS deployments. And virtually every one of our AWS SaaS customers is already on Grail as a core technology. They are already using and operating on Grail as a core technology.
Now it's a seamless migration happen in the background, customers didn't have to do anything. So they are already benefiting from Grail and the Grail deployment. Now the question that is -- the next question is what about logs on Grail. Good news is very strong evolution, already seeing customers using it at material scale, customers like global retailer doing 30 terabytes of logs per day, for example. So good evolution there. But logs on Grail requires a selling process through POCs. Now on the POC front, we saw an increase in POCs active POCs of about 20% quarter-over-quarter. So we continue to see the evolution of our POCs, again as a leading indicator for logs on Grail. So hopefully, that clarifies the distinction between Grail as an underlying core technology and logs on Grail as an incremental sale. Yes. Got it. And then going back to AI. There's been a lot of talk in the industry about vector databases or vector search. I don't know that we've talked about that in terms of the Dynatrace platform. Can you give sort of your perspective on vector and if that plays a role in the tech stack? Yes. I don't want to spend too much time on that other than to say that our view is that our hypermodal AI approach, we do believe to be radically different from other solutions and announcements in the market in the sense that it brings together multiple different AI techniques, and those techniques include what we've been doing for more than a decade with causal and predictive AI linked into what we expect to GA by the end of the year, the end of the calendar year, which is the generative AIPs. Putting those together, we believe, gives us a very, very strong platform for AI being an enormous ongoing differentiator for Dynatrace as it has been really throughout our history. Our next question is from Koji Ikeda with Bank of America. Just one for me. I wanted to ask a question on new logo growth and actually how to think about new logo growth for the rest of the year. In the quarter, very nice new logo growth of 15% definitely above that low single-digit target for the rest of the year. But when we look at the new logo add compares for the rest of the year, they get harder and harder. So how can we be thinking about the new growth -- new logo growth cadence from here? And what are you seeing in the pipeline that is giving you confidence for the remainder of the year on the new logo front? I'll take that. It's a good question, Koji, that you're absolutely right. We had a very good new logo quarter this quarter. We actually had a good new logo quarter in our fourth quarter as well. And if you do -- if you look at the guide, obviously, we're maintaining the guide at kind of low to mid-single digits. I will tell you that the pipeline looks very strong. Obviously, our pipeline is -- we have more visibility to the pipeline here over the next quarter and maybe the back half of the year. So the new logo pipeline is quite strong. And I think as I've shared on other calls, that we're really focused with our new logos on driving the right new logos. The right new logos that we think are going to drive incremental expansion once we land them. So we're not just signing up new logos for the sake of signing up new customers.
We're really particular, which is why you'll see that we continue to average around $130,000 average land size on a trailing 12-month basis, which is pretty solid. So we're focusing on the quality of the land. Our visibility is pretty good to new logos that I don't think we're going to have every quarter where you're going to grow 15%, but I think we have enough visibility that our ability to grow in the low to mid-single digits, I feel pretty confident. Our next question is from Kasthuri Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Rick, I have a question for you, one for Jim. Rick, your forward-looking indicators look quite good, considering the macro environment. You've got this GSI hat has 2 extra pipeline, that is expanding partnership with Azure. Yes, customers are taking longer. But why would you -- or would you not consider ramping up your sales capacity? It does look like next year, we do not have a recession, which is -- buts and ifs that as companies come out of downturns, the ones that accelerate the go-to-market and gain share or end up being very successful. So in that regard, as CEO of the company, how do you look to up the ante and gain share versus competition? Because it does look like the product value proposition with hypermodal AI, generative AI capabilities coming in by the end of this year, all look to really position the company well.
But one way you could counter the slow growth is to increase sales capacity because conversion multiplied by, as you know, you're veteran in the industry, you could still achieve better growth by deploying extra sales capacity when the forward-looking indicators are looking good. So wondering what your thoughts are there on that front. And also, Jim, one for you. If you ex out the early renewals in Q4, what would be the next net new ARR growth look like? So I'll take both, and then if Rick wants to comment, he can. So on the sales capacity side, we actually feel pretty good about sales capacity. I think I shared in the last call, and it's the same now that our tenure of reps that are 2-plus year reps is higher than it's been over the last couple of years. So as you can imagine, 2-plus year reps drive more productivity than new reps. And so our -- I don't believe at all that we're constraining sales capacity. We're going to make sure we align adding sales capacity as needed. So I don't think we're in a constrained world. We're going to align that with the demand environment if we see on incremental demand, then we will modulate adding more sales capacity. So I don't think we're constrained at all. I think there's an opportunity for us to get better leverage out of the existing model that we have, and we'll augment that as we see kind of the demand signals change.
So I feel pretty good about that. And on the early renewal side, you're right, we had about $13 million of renewals of expansions in the fourth quarter that were scheduled in the first quarter. I would say the first quarter was -- I mean, you're always going to have $1 million here or $1 million there, but nothing notable on kind of early renewals in the first quarter. I'd say the first quarter, as I've said in my opening remarks, it's seasonally the company's kind of lightest quarter and so our start to the year, we feel pretty good about. As I said, we're going to be a little bit more back-end loaded for the reasons that I outlined, but I feel pretty confident kind of in where we sit right now. Jim, the change in sales leadership did not have any effect on pulling a business into Q4 versus at the expense of Q1? No. Our next question is from Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. I wanted to ask about targets for both logs and analytics and security. I understand Grail is a platform that enables log and analytics. But you've sort of talked about ideas or direction of maybe kind of $100 million ARR in '25 for both. Is that still the case? And where do you think you are relative to those goals? And then beneath last quarter, you gave us some numbers for where you are in DPS in terms of the number of customers. My understanding is that to adopt Grail and thereby have log and analytic, you need to be on a DPS contract. Could you give us some update on specifics as it relates to a number of customers on the new contract platform? So I'll take maybe both of those, and if Rick wants to comment additionally, he can. So we feel pretty good about both the areas you mentioned, both application security and logs on Grail that we're on track to deliver the numbers that we talked about, $100 million for each. Obviously, Grail is being a little bit sooner, we said over a couple of years versus AppSec, which is going to be over 3 years. So we feel pretty good about that. I'd say, as you can imagine, we're further along on AppSec because AppSec's been out in the market longer. But to Rick's earlier points, we feel very good about the interest in Grail. And so I would expect to see an uptick in logs on Grail, in particular, over the course of the next year. We're still kind of early days with that. So again, I feel pretty confident in both $100 million targets.
And relative to DPS, I just want to make sure we're clear that you can buy logs on Grail. You don't have to have a DPS contract to buy logs on Grail. You can buy logs on Grail through a SKU-based model. Obviously, you have to be on the SaaS platform to benefit from logs on Grail. But you can buy logs on Grail outside of a DPS vehicle. Okay. Okay. But any comments on where you are on the conversion of your DPS? Yes. I mean I think as Rick -- yes, the way I'd characterize it is we're -- I think we're where we expected that like Rick said, we've only had DPS available, general availability since the end of April. And as you can imagine, buying cycles are 6 to 9 months. So most of the deals you've been closing have been deals that have been in the pipeline for a while. And those deals were deals that didn't necessarily have DPS as a vehicle. And so you wouldn't expect to see a huge uptick in DPS. I would say I would expect to see an uptick in DPS, one with new logos going forward and more of the back half of the year.
And so I'd say, as Rick said, I think we had several dozen incremental DPS contracts in the first quarter. And I think you're going to see more of that with new customers. And I think as customers renew, you'll start to see more of them expand with DPS. But I would expect more of an uptick later in the year and going into fiscal '25. Our next question is from Erik Suppiger with JMP Securities. I'm curious about the competitive landscape. If you have seen any change? And also, could you speak to what you see from the likes of New Relic in light of some of the changes going on with New Relic and curious if you have any comments about them going private, if that changes anything on the competitive front? So on the competitive landscape, no real change in the competitive landscape, no real change in kind of the pricing environment. DIY continues to be kind of the biggest competitor and outside of that, there are a handful of vendors that you'll see. And we've seen -- we didn't really comment on the script -- we probably could have that we continue to do a fair job of where customers have environments that get large and complex, and they have additional tools in place, whether it be DIY or competitor tools. We're seeing continued competitive takeouts, both AppD New Relic in particular.
And so environment hasn't changed. I think we continue to fare well, and we fare really well when customers start to reach a point where DIY and competitive tools just kind of max out. And relative to New Relic, the only thing I would say is that they've tended to focus on a different market segment than we have and where we do see them in the market, we compete very well. And actually, we mentioned in our last call that several of our competitive takeouts were actually New Relic competitive takeout. So obviously, when you're going through a take private, there is a bit of disruption. But I would say that where we see them, we fare well. Any comment when you say there in a different segment, are you referring to smaller customers? Or are you referring to cloud-first customers? Or what do you -- where do you see them? No, more size of customer that if you look at the general, the number of customers that they have, they are targeting not just enterprise customers, but they're also targeting the SMB space. We're only targeting the Global 15,000. So where we'll see them is maybe where they're playing in that space. And as I said, that we have found many cases where the customers' environments have gotten really complicated in multiple tools and even competitor tools just haven't scaled well and they've looked at alternatives and that alternative, we benefited from that with several key wins. And we've provided examples of that in prior calls of takeouts of competitors that have simply not scaled with the size, volume or complexity of their existing observability environments.
All right. Well, thank you all very much for your engaged questions. That brings us to the end of our formal call. We really do appreciate your ongoing support. We remain extremely bullish about the opportunity that lies ahead fundamentally. The software environment needs more and more observability and the observability that they need, needs to become more sophisticated in automating their solutions.
We're fueled by and proud of the third-party validations such as that from Gartner with us being highest in ability to execute furthest out in terms of completeness of vision. And we believe that, that provides even further catalyst for Dynatrace as we look at. We very much look forward to connecting with you at upcoming IR events over the coming weeks, and we wish you all a very good day. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.","the first quarter and fiscal 2024 Earnings conference call is being recorded . today's statements include forward-looking statements such as earnings and earnings guidance and economic conditions . unless otherwise noted, the growth rates we discuss are non-GAAP, reflecting constant currency growth .",0.0

I will now turn the conference over to Noelle Faris, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Faris, you may begin. Good morning, and thank you for joining Dynatrace's Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Rick McConnell, Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Chief Financial Officer.
Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements such as statements regarding revenue, earnings guidance and economic conditions. Actual results may differ materially from our expectations due to a number of risks and uncertainties discussed in Dynatrace's SEC filings, including our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q that we filed earlier today.
The forward-looking statements contained in this call represent the company's views on November 2, 2023. We assume no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information, future events or circumstances. Unless otherwise noted, the growth rates we discuss today are non-GAAP, reflecting constant currency growth and per share amounts are on a diluted basis. We will also discuss other non-GAAP financial measures on today's call, to see reconciliations between non-GAAP and GAAP measures, please refer to today's earnings press release and supplemental presentation, which are both posted in the financial results section of our IR website.
And with that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Rick McConnell. Thanks, Noelle, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for today's call.
We had an outstanding quarter exceeding the high end of our guidance across all metrics. ARR grew 24% year-over-year in constant currency. Subscription revenue increased 26% year-over-year in constant currency. Non-GAAP operating income increased to $106 million or 30% of revenue. And we delivered a 25% free cash flow margin on a trailing 12-month basis, including a 4-point impact for cash taxes.
These results continue to highlight the increasing criticality of observability and application security, and the significant value our platform provides to our customers. They also demonstrate the strength and resilience of our business model, resulting in a balanced combination of top line growth and profitability, as well as our ability to execute consistently in a challenging macro environment. Jim will share more details about our Q2 performance and increased fiscal 2024 guidance in a moment.
In the meantime, I'd like to review my perspective of the observability market, areas of strategic go-to-market investment and our ongoing focus on innovation. Let me start with what I'm hearing from customers. We've just wrapped up our annual Dynatrace Innovate series. We welcomed over 1,200 customers, prospects and partners in person to our events in São Paulo, Sydney and Barcelona. These events add tremendous value in terms of exchanging ideas, highlighting the value of our latest innovations and building long-term relationships. They also provide me with the opportunity to have one-on-one conversations with key decision makers about the topics that are critical to their businesses.
A few themes stood out across these events. First, observability and application security are critical, not only to customers' digital transformation journeys, but also a key element to business transformation and how they win in their respective markets. The CIO of a major Asia Pacific bank told me that they expect to differentiate on the quality of their software and user experience. And further, that Dynatrace is a core part of their strategy to achieve this business outcome.
Second, large enterprises continue to outgrow their DIY, open source and competitive dashboard and monitoring tools, seeking instead a much more dynamic, fully-unified observability platform. They want a solution that leverages all data types traces, metrics, logs, really, user data, et cetera, with the analytics in context that come from a unified data store, rather than a common user interface that requires a lot of extra effort to leverage. They come to Dynatrace to gain efficiencies through our AI and automation capabilities to proactively resolve issues before they result in costly outages.
The CIO of a large Canadian financial customer told me that he wants to leverage Dynatrace to move to the next level of software liability and performance. He believes that Dynatrace will enable better prediction of user impacting issues, and in so doing, improved business results. And perhaps an even more clear articulation of the value that Dynatrace provides our customers when it comes to identifying and resolving issues proactively, is from the CTO of a major bank in India. What he told me was ""We sleep because you don't.""
And third, vendor consolidation and standardization across their organizations are key priorities. Observability decisions that have previously been made at the department or even application level, especially in large complex enterprises, are increasingly centralizing. Dynatrace helps eliminate siloed tools, radically improve software availability and performance, reduce cost and increase organizational productivity. This enables our customers' teams to focus on innovation and growth, rather than break fix and maintenance.
I had a customer from a Global 50 technology company tell me, based on a very broad deployment of Dynatrace, that our platform is magic, providing insights into their software performance but they couldn't reproduce otherwise with multiple alternative tools. As a result of these market dynamics and the accelerated merging of business and technology objectives and strategies, customers are prioritizing observability spend, and our unified platform, AI leadership and automation are the 3 principal differentiators, enabling them to drive maximum value from these investments with Dynatrace.
This leads me to 3 strategic areas of increased go-to-market investment for the second half of our fiscal year to promote future top line growth. First, we continue to evolve and expand our partner focus, especially with the world's most preeminent global system integrators and hyperscalers.
To start, our customer base aligns directly with that of the GSIs. Given the complexity of cloud deployments, and that's broad-based digital transformation projects, observability has moved from optional to mandatory. And our GSI partners have broadly selected Dynatrace as their observability platform of choice for such initiatives.
In addition to our existing relationships with Deloitte and DXC, yesterday, Kyndryl and Dynatrace together announced a global strategic alliance, which has already resulted in numerous 6- and 7-figure wins. This agreement leverages Kyndryl's experience as the world's largest IT infrastructure services provider. And given our shared focus on AIOps, will enhance our joint cloud and application modernization offerings.
We are additionally pleased to announce the evolution of our partnership with Accenture. This expanded engagement brings together the value of the Dynatrace platform with Accenture's global professional services capabilities and cloud modernization delivery experience. Together, we can enable customers to accelerate their digital transformation and modernization journeys with end-to-end observability and application security.
With respect to hyperscalers, this past quarter, we extended our footprint with new cloud regions in São Paulo, Sydney and Zurich. Additionally, we announced an expanded go-to-market partnership with Microsoft, as well as the planned availability of Grail, natively on Azure, or early deployments by the end of this calendar year.
A second area of go-to-market expansion is our plan to accelerate the addition of sales capacity in the second half of our fiscal year, while we are not currently capacity constrained, we believe incremental resources near term can contribute meaningfully to growth in fiscal 2025 and beyond.
And third, we plan to add various targeted marketing investments to drive top of funnel pipeline. While we expect the current macro conditions to persist through the end of our fiscal year, we plan to increase spend levels prudently to enable incremental share gains in the future. Importantly, we plan to make these additional investments within the envelope of our guidance that Jim will cover in more detail.
I'd like to share a few customer wins this past quarter that are illustrative of our go-to-market evolution. A major e-commerce company realize that some potential customers were unable to add products to their online shopping cart, resulting in millions of dollars of lost revenue. Dynatrace identified the root cause of the issue during a POC, leading to a 7-figure competitive win.
A large government agency expanded their existing relationship with Dynatrace after realizing a unified analytics platform could save them more than $4 million over 5 years. The agency originally chose Dynatrace due to our highly automated approach and the maturity of our AI capabilities. Once Dynatrace was in place, they realized they could identify potential problems before they occur, allowing them to resolve issues before they resolve in costly outages.
And a leading financial services company was struggling with tool sprawl, spiraling cost for logs and unanticipated overages from other vendors, benefiting from the predictability and flexibility of the new Dynatrace Platform Subscription or DPS agreement, the customer signed a 7-figure multiyear deal. Within a day of instrumenting one of their key apps, Dynatrace identified the source of a problem they had been struggling with 4 months.
I love these depictions of the value that we deliver. But we don't, for one moment, take these perspectives for granted, and we are committed to earning our customer support each day in a rapidly evolving technology landscape.
I'd next like to turn to our relentless focus on market-leading innovation that drives our entire organization as one of our core values. This is especially evident in the continuous stream of new capabilities that enhance our platform.
Beginning with AI, our customers have benefited from Davis for more than a decade. Last quarter, I shared air plans to add a third critical element to our existing Davis AI architecture, a generative AI capability, named Davis CoPilot. I'm happy to share that we are on track with our development efforts to deliver early previews by the end of the calendar year and general availability in early calendar 2024.
Of course, many organizations have announced strategies around generative AI. Our approach, however, goes far beyond simply adding a natural language interface that relies on human intelligence to steer gen AI queries. Dynatrace's Davis AI, will combine predictive, causal and generative AI techniques, with each one excelling in specific capabilities. For example, Davis predictive and causal AI will feed comprehensive and precise prompts to Davis CoPilot. Davis CoPilot will in turn create queries dashboards and suggested code for automation workflows. This enables customers to avoid outages or performance degradations before they happen, and help remediate and resolve active incidents when they arise.
We think of the convergence of these 3 AI techniques as hypermodal, in that they will deliver incredible power individually and even more so together. Hypermodal AI enables customers to advance their visibility in their IT ecosystem, from infrastructure and apps all the way to end user experience.
Second, October marked the first anniversary of several of the most significant innovations in our platform to date, including Grail. As I've mentioned in the past, Grail is a massively parallel processing, index-less data lake house, or data store that provides near real-time analytics and insights into how an IT environment is working. Grail is available as a SaaS offering, which comprises the majority of our customer deployments.
Essentially, all of our AWS SaaS customers are now running on Grail. And as I mentioned, our Grail deployment with Azure is slated to begin rollout by the end of this quarter. Log management is a monetizable use case that leverages the power of Grail.
As of the second quarter, we had 300 customers leveraging logs powered by Grail to help eliminate manual correlations between multiple tools, alerts and data silos, in addition to reducing cost.
A major U.S. car rental company added logs on Grail to their existing deployment to gain visibility into business events that were causing delayed API responses and revenue impact. They are using nearly 200 custom metrics across the enterprise with instant learning and auto remediation to proactively identify and resolve performance issues to grow their business.
Third, we continue to innovate in application security. Public headlines of security breaches and stolen credentials, along with the new SEC reporting requirements for cybersecurity incident disclosures, are helping elevate awareness for additional security coverage.
In August, we announced the expansion of our security capabilities to include security analytics. Now customers can detect, prioritize and investigate run time vulnerabilities. Security Analytics also integrates with Automation Engine, which can create workflows to assess impact and trigger a response.
A Texas government agency expanded their existing deployment with us, to include security protection and analytics, which accounted for more than 40% of the expansion deal. And finally, we are excited about the ongoing evolution of our platform in the area of developer observability. We believe development teams will continue to take on a larger role in the observability and security decision process. And we are developing tools to streamline their product development life cycle.
We recently closed the acquisition of Rookout, a highly differentiated technology that enables developers to debug live code in production. We believe that integrating Rookout's debugging technology seamlessly into the Dynatrace platform will be very powerful for development teams, enabling them to extend less the value of observability for their organizations.
Before I turn the call over to Jim, I'd like to highlight our inaugural Global Impact Report, which is available on the Dynatrace website. We believe advancing our ESG strategy is paramount to our success and our responsibility as a global company. The report details progress related to Dynatrace's 3 ESG pillars: sustaining the environment, people, culture and community, and governance and ethics.
As part of the report, we disclosed our baseline greenhouse gas emissions data for the first time, and provided an expanded scope of data on diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging. We will continue to develop and implement programs that drive progress on our ESG initiatives, and engage with our stakeholders as we expand our ESG road map.
In closing, I'm very pleased with our Q2 execution and believe we are well positioned to deliver strong results in the back half of FY '24. We market for observability and application security is extremely large and growing. Our unified platform, AI leadership and automation differentiate us in the market and place us in a position of strength relative to our competition. And we plan to continue to manage our business prudently and invest strategically in those areas that we believe will enable us to extend our leadership position in the future.
Jim, over to you. Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Q2 was another quarter of consistent execution by the Dynatrace team.
We delivered strong results in a dynamic environment, meeting the high end of our guidance across all of our top line and profitability metrics. These strong results were driven by the combination of high-value new logo lands on the Dynatrace platform, the ongoing expansion of existing customers and an inherently efficient business model, allowing us to deliver a continued balance of growth and profitability. Our ability to successfully navigate in a tight budgetary environment is a testament to the resilience of our value proposition, our commitment to customer success and our incredible team.
Now let's dive into the second quarter results in more detail. And please note that the growth rates mentioned will be year-over-year and in constant currency, unless otherwise stated.
Starting with annual recurring revenue, or ARR, total ARR for the second quarter was $1.34 billion, an increase of $279 million year-over-year, representing 24% year-over-year growth. Net new ARR on a constant currency basis was $59 million in the quarter and exceeded our expectations in what is normally one of our seasonally latest bookings quarters of the year. This outperformance were driven by several notable 7-figure competitive wins and ongoing expansions in the customer base.
We added 160 new logos to the Dynatrace platform in Q2, roughly consistent with the year ago quarter. As we have shared in the past, we are very focused on the quality of new logo lands that have a greater propensity to expand. The average ARR per new logo land size continues to grow and was roughly $140,000 on a trailing 12-month basis, up 18% year-over-year.
As Rick outlined, we continue to attract enterprise customers that are outgrowing their existing DIY or commercial tooling solutions and coming to Dynatrace for the depth, breadth and automation of our unified observability platform.
Our gross retention rate remained best-in-class in our industry in the mid-90s and contributed to a net retention rate of 114% in the second quarter, in line with our expectations. Observability remains a priority for our customers, and we continue to see them expand with us, albeit at a moderate pace, as they move more cautiously in an uncertain economy. Customer platform adoption remains strong with 64% of our customers using 3 or more modules, up from 55% of customers in the year ago quarter, and with an average ARR of over $500,000.
As Rick mentioned, we see growing customer interest in newer product offerings, including logs on Grail and application security. Our track record of groundbreaking innovation will support expansion opportunities in our installed base, with more meaningful ARR contribution from our latest product introductions expected in fiscal '25.
We also believe the new DPS pricing model is another area that will drive future expansion opportunities. We're seeing traction with both new customers during the platform, and existing customers like Duke Energy and an Australian government agency who prefer the flexibility and predictability of our DPS licensing model. We have closed over 100 DPS deals globally since it became generally available in April of this year, bringing total DPS customers to over 250. And while the rollout is still in the early stages, we believe DPS has the potential to drive meaningful accretion and net retention rate across most of our installed base in the future.
Moving on to revenue. Total revenue for the second quarter was $352 million, up 24% year-over-year, and subscription revenue for the second quarter was $334 million, up 26% year-over-year. Both exceeded the high end of our guidance by $6 million, driven by strong bookings linearity in the quarter.
With respect to margins, non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter was 85%, up 1 point from the prior quarter and up 2 points from Q2 of last year. Our non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $106 million, this is $13 million above the high end of our guidance range, roughly half of the overachievement was driven by the revenue upside in the quarter. The other half was driven by gross margin improvement from ongoing cloud hosting efficiency efforts, prudent half 1 hiring and the timing of the Rookout acquisition closing. This resulted in a non-GAAP operating margin of 30%, exceeding the top end of the guidance range by 300 basis points.
Non-GAAP net income was $93 million or $0.31 per diluted share. This was $0.04 above the high end of our guidance range, driven by the items I just highlighted. Our free cash flow was $34 million in the second quarter. As we've mentioned in the past, we believe it is best to view free cash flow over a trailing 12-month period due to the seasonality and variability in billings quarter-to-quarter.
On a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow was $330 million or 25% of revenue. As a reminder, this includes 400 basis points of impact related to cash taxes. Pretax free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was 29% of revenue and up 32% year-over-year. Finally, we ended the second quarter with a robust balance sheet including $702 million of cash and 0 debt.
Moving on to guidance. We are raising our full year guidance across all top line and profitability metrics, to reflect the strength of our second quarter performance, the health of our pipeline and our visibility into the back half of the fiscal year. This increase in guidance includes incremental FX headwinds from a strengthening U.S. dollar.
Before I jump into the details, there are a few items to keep in mind with respect to our guidance. First, the building blocks of growth for the business continue to be new logos and net retention rate. This guidance assumes new logo growth in the low single digits and a net retention rate of 112% to 113% for the second half of fiscal 2024.
Second, our guidance assumes, the net new ARR contribution from new logos will approach 40%, with roughly 60% of net new ARR, are from expansion activity. This mix differs from our historical mix of roughly 1/3 of ARR growth from new logos and 2/3 from expansion. But given the robust new logo pipeline health and growing deal sizes, we believe that net new ARR mix will be more weighted to new logos than in the past.
Third, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar since our last call creates a headwind relative to our prior full year guidance. Incrementally, the foreign exchange headwind is roughly $16 million to ARR, and approximately $8 million to revenue for the full year.
And with that, let's start with our updated guidance for the full year, with growth rates in constant currency. We are raising our ARR guidance by roughly $3 billion midpoint to $1.48 billion to $1.49 billion, representing 19% to 20% growth year-over-year, up 100 basis points from our prior guidance. This guidance raise represents an increase of approximately $19 million on a constant currency basis.
Given the strength of ARR in the second quarter, we now expect the seasonality of net new ARR to be similar to prior years, with roughly 40% in the first half and 60% in the back half of fiscal '24. Also similar to last year, we expect Q4 net new ARR to be slightly higher than Q3 on a constant currency basis.
We are raising our revenue guidance by approximately $7 million at the midpoint to $1.409 billion and $1.419 billion, representing 21% to 22% growth year-over-year, up 100 basis points from our prior guidance. This guidance raise represents an increase of roughly $15 million on a constant currency basis.
We are raising our subscription revenue guidance by approximately $6 million at the midpoint to $1.334 billion to $1.344 billion, representing 22% to 23% growth year-over-year, up 100 basis points from our prior guidance. This guidance raise represents an increase of roughly $14 million on a constant currency basis.
Turning to our bottom line. The strength and resilience of our financial model is evident in our ongoing margin performance. We are committed to maintaining a balanced approach that optimizes cost to drive profitability, while also investing in future growth opportunities that we believe will drive long-term value. We will continue to invest heavily in R&D innovation.
And as Rick mentioned, we plan to step up go-to-market investments in several areas. GSI partnerships, sales capacity and demand generation activities. With this in mind, we are still raising our full year non-GAAP operating margin guidance by 125 basis points to 27%, an increase of $20 million at the midpoint. We are raising non-GAAP EPS guidance, $1.09 to $1.12 per diluted share, representing an increase of $0.06 at the midpoint of the range. This non-GAAP EPS is based on a diluted share count of 300 million to 301 million shares, and a non-GAAP effective cash tax rate of 19%, consistent with prior guidance.
And finally, we are raising our free cash flow guidance to $313 million to $320 million, representing an increase of $9 million at the midpoint, and a free cash flow margin of 22% to 23% of revenue. As a reminder, while we do not guide free cash flow quarterly due to the seasonality and variability in billings, as well as the timing of cash tax payments, we expect free cash flow to be higher in our first and fourth quarters and significantly lower in our second and third quarters.
Looking at Q3, we expect total revenue to be between $356 million and $359 million, or 19% to 20% growth. Subscription revenue is expected to be between $337 million and $340 million, up 20% to 21% year-over-year. From a profit standpoint, non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $94 million and $97 million, or 26.5% to 27% of revenue, and non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.27 to $0.28 per diluted share.
In summary, we are very pleased with our second quarter fiscal '24 performance, and we have a strong pipeline and good visibility into the remainder of the fiscal year. We continue to take a prudent approach to our outlook, given the ongoing volatility of the macro environment, but we remain optimistic about our long-term growth opportunities and our ability to deliver balanced growth and profitability.
And with that, we will open the line for questions. Operator? [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Great. Thanks, team. Great quarter, and we're going to give you a good job outlining all the product advantage, certainly a lot to look forward to there.
What struck me in your comments, you mentioned stepping up hiring in the second half. That's sounded bullish to us, given sort of what you guys talked about on the call. With unchanged macros out there, I guess maybe just double click on what gave you the confidence to reinvest in the business now. Thanks, Matt. Appreciate the comment. What we're seeing is very good visibility in pipeline into the second half, which obviously is increasing visibility for the second half relative to where we were last quarter. So that's point number one.
And point number 2 is, that at some stage, macro is going to improve. And obviously, in putting in place sales people, it takes some time to really get them ramp to value. So we wanted to start at this stage to be prepared for FY '25. That sounds good. Maybe just one other quick one. In the sort of unchanged macros, curious, you guys aren't necessarily tied to consumption as much as others. But curious what you saw on kind of the cloud optimization trends within your customer base? I know it's been an ongoing debate with hyperscalers. But curious what your customers are saying on kind of the optimization side. Our view is that the optimization cycle continues. The good news is, with a subscription as opposed to directly consumption-oriented business model. We have an opportunity to really prevent the same degree of impact that others see in the optimization cycles. So that's good. I'd say that's point one.
Point two, from our perspective as we maintained that over the last couple of calls, is that we really see observability has, in many ways, an antidote to cloud optimization cycles by making our cloud deployments actually more efficient. So we continue to see that in our new logo lands, which were very strong last quarter. Our next question is from the line of Pinjalim Bora with JPMorgan. I just wanted to double quick on the strength in ARR performance this quarter. Maybe talk about what drove that. Was there any pushouts from Q1 that helped -- anything to call out in terms of federal budget process studies. So anything that would help? Thank you, Pinjalim. I'll take that. So we had a really strong Q2. And really, we continue to see, we actually, this has been probably 3 or 4 quarters now in a row, where we continue to see growing interest in Dynatrace on the new logo front, with really high-quality lands. And so that trend has continued.
Our pipeline, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks for new logos in the back half is also quite strong. So we had a really strong second quarter for new logo lands, which I think is a testament to the value proposition of the Dynatrace platform. Customers are outgrowing either DIY solutions or in several cases, outgrowing competitive solutions that just couldn't scale. And so that was largely the driver, Pinjalim. And as I mentioned before, we're still seeing healthy expansions. We're just seeing expansions at a more moderated pace as customers are more cautious given the macro environment. Understood. One for Rick. On logs on Grail, cost has been an issue in general in the industry around log analytics for customers. What has been the customer feedback on pricing for log analytics on Grail. And maybe touch on the pipeline for logs on Grail from the second half and if you're seeing any kind of impact from the recent acquisitions in the industry kind of starting to help at least in the conversations, if not, in deal closures. Pinjalim. On the pipeline, perhaps I'll cover that one first. Last quarter, we reported on the order of about 300 POCs in logs on Grail.
And as we sit here, this quarter, we've got a few hundred or so paying logs on Grail customers, and the POC pipeline has increased by about 20% over where we were last year. So we're seeing, I would say, very good penetration of logs on Grail overall.
On the pricing piece, our expectation is that while we do price more heavily in the analytics area and say, in the ingest or storage area of logs that on average, we're going to still provide a discount to current market pricing from most other vendors. So we should be a good solution in the market from a pricing and cost endpoint as well. Our next question is from the line of Will Power with Baird. Okay. Great. Rick, maybe starting with you. Just interested in some of your comments on your innovate meetings and in particular, kind of what you're hearing with respect to customer demand around some of the hypermodal AI capabilities that you're working on, expect to go GA next year? Just love to kind of hear your perspective as to what customers are looking for there, what demand indicators look like on that front? And then how are you thinking about the monetization there? Will. Well, the short form is that as customers understand our story, they fully appreciate the notion that we deliver causal and predictive AI today and we have for over a decade. And these are highly deterministic AI techniques. So they provide very precise answers and intelligent automation from data already.
The generative IPs through Davis CoPilot, that is incremental to essentially provide, not only a natural language interface in the causal and predictive AI, but to do so in an iterative way to make the whole greater than the sum of the parts. So from the feedback that I got from São Paulo, Sydney, Barcelona, the innovate sessions we did there is a lot of talk around how to leverage Dynatrace for all 3 AI techniques as we look to the future. Okay. Any thoughts, just with respect to kind of the monetization piece of that, how that kind of folds into the equation? We haven't finalized the monetization piece, Will, but we will do so over the coming quarter so to sort out, we're going to monetize generative AI and Davis CoPilot in particular. But nothing to report yet on that at this point. Okay. And if I could just sneak in one, maybe for Jim. Just thinking about net retention rates. I know down a bit, although I know expected, just would kind of love to try to get a little additional color as to what's driving that. Is it fewer new product expansions? Is it lighter usage, weaker renewals? Is there anything else you could add, any other color there? Well, I'll start with, I mean, our renewals remain really strong. I mean we've talked about that our gross retention rate remains in the mid-90s. So the product is very, very sticky. So it's certainly not a retention rate.
It's as I outlined, kind of in the prepared remarks, that we -- there are customers that continue to prioritize observability, but I would say customers continue to remain cautious and they're doing expansions. And not every customer is the same. Some customers are prioritizing, hey, I'm seeing growth in new workloads and I'm going to moderate maybe newer workloads that have observability until I have better line of sight into my own kind of business.
And then there are cases where customers are adding new workloads. So it kind of varies. It varies by customer, it varies by industry. But I would say customers continue to prioritize observability, and until they get better visibility into their own environments, I think that kind of what we're seeing is probably going to remain consistent.
I will say, as I said earlier, that we are quite optimistic that we continue to see growing pipeline not just with new logos, also expansions. But new logos, in particular, I think, suggests that customers are starting to make observability architecture decisions, and I think that's a net positive for Dynatrace. I think we're well positioned in that space. Thank you. Nice job on the results. Thanks, Will. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Actually, can I stay on that topic and maybe we kind of up leverage a little bit. I mean, look, in tough times, usually, you're leaning in on the installed base and the new logos are coming in a bit slower, and it's tougher to sign them there. The -- but with you, it seems almost the other way.
How much of that is driven on the new logo side, in terms of people understanding your broader message? There's a lot of competitors that got taken out. So there's a lot of disruption in the market. So what's driving that? And you obviously did a lot more work on kind of getting new logos, started to work with partners better, et cetera. Like can you speak to that a little bit? Because that's kind of different than what you hear from anyone else. Yes, I'll take that. So I want to be clear, we're continuing to see healthy growth with installed base customers. So I just want to make sure we're clear that we continue to see good growth with the installed base customers. And in particular, we see customers that where our value proposition is really, really strong, which is large, complex environments. Those customers, their expansion rates are growing at an even more increased pace than kind of the average for the company.
And on the new logo front, it's more, customers are seeing pain points. They're seeing pain points with their, either their existing solutions, which could be competitor solutions or existing tooling. And it's cumbersome. When they're seeing outages, it's difficult to ascertain where it is, and there's people chasing alerts that -- so I would say, observability, customers are making more and more architectural decisions. And when they're making architectural decisions and they're evaluating vendors, especially in large complex environments, we score very well. And so I think we're seeing a pipeline relative to that with customers that are starting to make, I would say, obviously, platform decisions. They're making platform decisions in different areas, and they're making decisions on observability as kind of a platform observability and application security.
So I think we're well positioned. And I think the sales organization is appropriately going after that opportunity. And as I said for the last few quarters, we're focusing on the quality of the land more so than the number of new logos because we find that the quality of land results in better expansion longer term. Yes. That is perfect. Yes. That's very clear. And then I know it's tough with DPS to kind of go into the different parts, but what are you seeing in terms of, we talked a little bit about logs, logs on Grail, et cetera. But in terms of you kind of being able to be broader than just APM in terms of getting infrastructure, more logs into the deals, like when you talk about the big architecture decisions, is that people kind of understanding the full observability package that you guys are offering and kind of going that way? Or is it still, what are you seeing there on the more, the newer areas where you like infrastructure logs. Congrats from me as well. Thanks, Raimo. What I would say on the DPS front, in particular, on the penetration of multi modules is that a year or so ago, we were around 50% or so of customer lands were at 3-plus modules, that's now 2/3. So we continue to see the broad platform play. We certainly expect DPS to be a key component of that by facilitating expansion across the portfolio of modules that we have for customers to utilize a broader array of the Dynatrace platform. So DPS really does facilitate this multi-module deployment and use. Next question is from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Congrats. Rick, I applaud you on stepping up the go-to-market investments, really, really well timed. I've got one for you on, more of a financial question.
One is, when you look at the different initiatives to drive growth, you've got product initiatives, Grail. You got app security and then you got the partnerships with the hyperscalers, SI. And the growth rate of the company is very solid in whatever you printed, which means that the underlying core APM business is probably a little bit slower. Maybe that will pick up when the macro clears up.
So any thoughts on how the company's exposure to growth opportunities looks like, as you come out of this malaise, could we see the underlying ex growth acceleration initiatives really start to come back to the forefront. And a financial question is, how do you measure return on investment, whether it's investing dollar and go-to-market, or research and development. What are the ways in which you quantify the return you're looking for? Well, let me take a crack at it and then Rick can kind of offer some comments. So I think you said it well, that we are -- there's multiple things we're doing.
One, we're -- we continue to have probably the best portfolio of offerings in the observability application or application security space. And we continue to make it better with logs on Grail. We continue to make it better with some of the enhancements that we're making on the application security side with one of the announcements that we made around security analytics within the quarter.
So we're making investments, unified platform. And within the unified platform, you can get a bunch of capabilities. And so we're continuing to do that. And we're at different phases, Kash, of penetration, whether it be some of the newer areas of application security and logs. And we're obviously doing well around full stack monitoring, we're doing well around other areas.
So there's lots of product-related areas for us to continue to penetrate into the customer base, broaden and introduce new logos. We're continuing to make those investments and we'll continue to do so. I think those will be a catalyst for growth, to your point, once kind of uneven macro conditions subside.
And on the go-to-market front, it's multiple things. We continue to make investments in partnerships. Obviously, these and partnerships that we're talking about GSIs, we mentioned that they take multiple years. But these are really critical GSIs. And the announcement of Kyndryl, another large one. We've already won business with Kyndryl even before they were a strategic partner. So that plus adding additional sales capacity is really again going to be the catalyst, you have more products and more offerings to sell, you need more capacity, including leveraging your channel to be able to do that.
And then relative to ROI, we definitely look at dollars. Depends upon R&D versus go-to-market R&D, you're kind of looking at investments you're making in different product areas and what you expect as far as incremental revenue over a period of time. And then on the go-to-market side, we definitely look at the demand environment, in particular, the pipeline and where and when does it make sense to make investments in go-to-market based on certain productivity levels.
So there's multiple levers that we're looking at, and as Rick said, we think now is the time to maybe step up investments. And we had indicated that earlier that we thought we'd be making a bit more go-to-market investments in the back half of the year. And we're doing that. And I think it's a signal that we're seeing some growth in the pipeline. We're having very good visibility. And as Rick said, we're trying to make sure that when you make these investments, the return you get on these investments happen in the future, and we want to make sure that we're positioned for fiscal '25 and beyond to capitalize on that. I would simply add, Kash, that we are extraordinarily disciplined as a company in ROI evaluation of incremental investments. So when we look at logs on Grail and the investments that we're making there, AppSec and the investments we're making there, any acquisitions that we look at of tuck-ins and the like, all the way through the go-to-market investments we suggested, the GSI partnerships, hyperscaler engagements and partnerships, sales force expansion in the second half, marketing -- targeted marketing investments, all within the guidance envelope we provided are very, very disciplined in approach. Next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. And I likewise had to -- but first, solid results. The first one is more of a macro question. In many of the infrastructure software companies, and indeed the global SIs as well has suggested that spending slowed during the course of September quarter. And I wanted to get your perspective on the observability space. Do you think the spending within the context of observability has slowed and you guys outperform? Or did you not see that slowing reflected in the pipe or close rates or things along those lines? Yes, I'll take that, Keith. I would say we really didn't see any change throughout the quarter, to be honest, at the quarter. Again, we had some strong new logo lands that I mentioned, but we didn't see anything towards the tail end of the quarter that suggested any change.
One thing I did mention in the opening remarks, we had really good linearity this quarter. That -- so our monthly linearity was really strong, actually one of the strongest that we've seen. And so it didn't -- certainly didn't suggest that things kind of weakened in September. Okay. And then the second question on security and logs on analytics. You previously suggested that sort of $100 million run rate exiting '25. Are you still on track for that? And Rick, just to clarify, I think you said the pipe for logs was up 20% year-over-year, but did you mean sequentially, because... Yes. I said, year-over-year, Keith, I meant sequentially from last quarter. I was speaking, and compared to last quarter. So a 20% increase in POC is quarter-over-quarter for logs. And in addition to that, 300 now paying customers in logs on Grail.
And to answer the first question of, are we still on track for $100 million in AppSec by end of FY '25. The answer is yes, we're still tracking to that number. And we saw a good penetration... And how about for log? Same thing. Logs, we had said $100 million within 8 quarters, AppSec $100 million within 12, both would put us at the end of FY '25, and we continue to track to those numbers. Next question is from the line of Andrew Nowinski with Wells Fargo. Congrats on a great quarter. So I wanted to start with a question on Microsoft. So I know you're expanding your partnership with them and you'll have Grail on at the end of the year on Azure.
So I'm wondering, how are you thinking about the opportunity relative to some of your other go-to-market channels, particularly in FY '25, given that Microsoft is talking about seeing an increase in AI workloads, which I would think would benefit Dynatrace given how pervasively you have AI weaved into your platform and Davis CoPilot. Thanks, Andy. Absolutely agree on generative AI. It will be a tailwind for our business as we look to the future. And as more organizations deploy generative AI, it isn't just to think about Davis CoPilot, it is also to think about all the workloads that companies are going to be deploying in generative AI that will dramatically increase compute and therefore, the need to provide observability. So absolutely, that's a tailwind. Microsoft, obviously, will be a core leader in that and us with them.
On the Microsoft front, specifically, we're very excited to, through the course of the quarter, began early rollout and then completed at the beginning of next calendar year with Grail on Azure. So that is a major step forward in advance. And in addition to that, we're very excited about the acceleration of the go-to-market partnership with Microsoft, in particular, with Azure as well, which increases joint selling. Overall, I would simply say that the hyperscaler channel for us is a very important one, which continues to grow nicely in terms of overall transaction volume simply because that is a preferred purchase method of choice, from a large percentage of our customers. That's very helpful. Maybe one last follow-up question. You raised your fiscal '24 free cash flow outlook. And I'm just wondering if you could talk about your thoughts on, maybe the long-term free cash flow margin and where you think it could go, given that we're seeing some nice expansion here already. Yes. I'm not prepared to talk about long-term free cash flow margins. I will tell you that we are kind of a rare class that, one, we're probably the only, or one of the very few companies in the infrastructure software space that actually pays cash taxes because they're profitable. And so our pretax free cash flow margins are in the high 20s. So very, very healthy.
And so while I'm not prepared to tell you about what the long-term model is, I think we -- I would say we are in a really good place. And we will continue to make balanced investments that we think will kind of be focused on getting top line growth reacceleration, while continuing to deliver really, really good operating margin and free cash flow margins. Wonderful. Thanks, guys. Keep up the good work. Thanks, Andy. Our next question is from the line of Mike Cikos with Needham & Company. I wanted to circle back on DPS for a second. It kind of follows on from some of the line of questioning that Raimo had.
But if I'm just looking at the north of 250 DPS customers that you're citing today, I know that obviously, that cohort of customers is growing versus the earlier adopters were really some of your largest powered users. And I think in the prepared remarks, the management team also noted how DPS is expected to drive improved NRR over time.
Given the growing size of this customer base, can you start providing us maybe a little bit of color as far as what you're seeing with respect to those spending trends coming from those customers as they come into DPS? Like do we have enough of a size or scale here when thinking about that customer cohort to get a better sense of how that is translating into NRR at this time. It's a great question. I would say that I think the cohort size is not big enough yet. While we're really happy with the traction that we're getting on DPS, but to answer your question more directly about will we provide you more color, the answer is yes. We will provide you more color.
I just don't think it's difficult to make comments now, to your earlier point, a lot of the early adopters of DPS when it was limited availability were our largest customers. So the sample size is a bit skewed. We want to make sure that we have a bit broader of a sample size.
But just a general premise of DPS, one is, good customer interest; and two, just having a model where you can do a kind of an annual or multiyear commit with access to the platform with a consumption drawdown around all of our capabilities, is just something that we think it's just a much more frictionless way of customers adopting our technology, which is why we're bullish about it being overall kind of expansion rate accretive. But we'll provide you information on that as we think that there is kind of better information to make broader comments versus a sample size that's small. Mike, maybe just highlight some of the comments in the prepared remarks, say, number one, feedback on DPS from customers is extremely positive. It gives them much more flexibility over multiyear durations to use and consume the platform.
The second piece is, as Jim had said earlier, the expectation over the next few years is that 80% to 90% of our customer base will be on DPS. So this is definitely a preferred directional heading both for customers and for us at Dynatrace. Got it. And then I guess, kind of kind of flows into the next question here. But I know one of the things that the management team cited for the net new ARR outperformance, was competitive wins as well as expansions, right?
And so I was hoping you could kind of unpack that. And I don't want to lead you to an answer here, but like, if you could look at it in like 3 different categories, like the first is like, are you finding that your win rates are actually increasing?
And then the second is, do you feel like Dynatrace is actually getting more looks or bake-offs based on the expanded product announcements and maybe this more frictionless packaging with DPS? And then the third, when you are replacing or displacing some of these other competitive solutions, who are you seeing more commonly? Is there any shift as far as that vendor consolidation that is coming towards DT? I know it's a lot to unpack, but just wanted to make sure I'm thinking about all these things appropriately. I would say, again, I'd start with, you got to be -- we're very optimistic and positive about what we've seen for kind of, in particular, new logo wins and competitive wins. It's been multiple quarters.
I would say for Q2, you had a lot in there. I would say, one, the pipeline continues to grow for the reasons I outlined, which is, customers are beginning to make observability architecture decisions. And I think when they do that, we certainly do the net bat -- because I think customers look at, well, who are the leaders in that space, and we come to mind. And so we fare very well when we get to the point of a POC.
So yes, I think we're getting some good at bats. And I think that there is a growing pipeline in that space. And so, and as I said before, that even the existing customers that we have, they're continuing to expand. I just think that customers are being a bit cautious. But we're optimistic. It's reflected in our guide for the full year, which is why I provided a little bit of color that I thought that our weighting of net new ARR would maybe be a bit more weighted to new logos than we've seen historically, call it, 40% roughly new logos, 60% expansion versus a 1/3, 2/3.
And I think it's just continued good execution by the sales team. And I think it speaks to the importance of a unified platform for customers as they make these choices. Mike, I would simply add that just to provide a piece of data for you. Last quarter, we had $10 million-plus TCV wins for new logos, and 8 of those were competitive takeouts of our direct competitors. So we track win rates very, very carefully. And in so doing, we feel very, very good about our win rates and competitive environments in our target market space, and I think DPS is contributing there as well. Great to hear. I appreciate all the color, and congrats on the strong results here in the uncertain macro, really stand out. Our final question will be from the line of Jake Roberge with William Blair. Congrats on the great results. Just wanted to follow up on the 300 customers that you referenced for the logs on Grail. What did initial landing sizes look like for those deals? And then are those deals still largely on the expansion front? Or have you actually started to see Grail drive any new logos to the platform? Yes. I would say that, again, I think we've said this before, but the way it's going to work with logs on Grail, and we're starting to see this is, one, many of those customers will do a POC.
As Rick said, the good news is we talked about 300-kind of plus POCs in the last quarter. Now we have 300 paying customers this quarter. So it suggests to you that those POCs have been largely positive. But the way it's going to work is customers are going to try new workloads, and they're going to leverage the product with new workloads. And then they'll add more new workloads. And then we think it will get to the point where depending upon the value that they're getting from the offering that they'll start to shift to existing workloads.
So the way we view this is, they're going to start small and get a ramp, and they're going to ramp over time. And our expectation is that the ramp we're going to see, as you'll see some ramp in the back half of the year, but you'll see a much bigger ramp in fiscal '25 as they start doing more adoption. Okay. Very helpful. And then could you give us some more color on the growth you're seeing in that GSI segment? And how big those practices are today from a Dynatrace train head count perspective? Just compared to where they were 2 or 3 years ago when you actually started that motion.
And when we think about partners like Kyndryl, Accenture, Deloitte and DXC, what are some tangible differences about those relationships versus some of the other GSIs you're working with? Thanks, Jake. The GSI partnerships succinctly, we're very, very excited about each of them. They each have substantial runway and opportunity. Most of them, we've been working with, as we reported, I think, last quarter, we have relationships now with really all 10 of the top 10 GSIs. But they keep escalating in import.
So as an example, the Kyndryl relationship has existed. We talked about a reasonable number of 6-, 7-digit wins that we've had previously. Those continue, we've escalated into a strategic partnership. Same thing with Accenture, with a mutual go-to-market investment on both sides. So very, very excited about that.
The GSIs are going to evolve over a longer period of time because the sale cycles in digital transformation initiatives are long. So it's going to take some time to gestate. But we believe that it is a very, very significant channel that could develop for us over time, and we're leaned into these partnerships in a meaningful way. Great. Congrats again on the great results. Thanks, Jay. Let me go ahead and wrap up at this point.
Thank you all for your engaged questions, your ongoing support. We really do appreciate it. We're quite bullish about the opportunity that lies ahead. We look forward to connecting with your upcoming IR events over the coming weeks, and we wish you all a very good day. Thanks for joining. Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. We thank you for your participation.","this conference is being recorded .

At this time, I'll turn the conference over to Noelle Faris, Vice President of Investor Relations. Noelle, you may now begin. Good morning, and thank you for joining Dynatrace's Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Rick McConnell, Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Chief Financial Officer. 
Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements such as statements regarding revenue, earnings guidance and economic conditions. Actual results may differ materially from our expectations due to a number of risks and uncertainties discussed in Dynatrace's SEC filings, including our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q that was filed earlier today.
The forward-looking statements contained in this call represent the company's views on February 8, 2024. We assume no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information, future events or circumstances. Unless otherwise noted, the growth rates we discuss today are non-GAAP, reflecting constant currency growth rates and per share amounts are on a diluted basis. We will also discuss other non-GAAP financial measure on today's call. To see reconciliations between non-GAAP and GAAP measures, please refer to today's earnings press release and supplemental presentation, which are both posted in the financial results section of our IR website. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Rick McConnell. Thanks, Noelle, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for today's call. Our Q3 results of balanced growth, profitability and free cash flow reflect our continued ability to execute successfully in a dynamic market. ARR grew 21% year-over-year. Subscription revenue increased 23% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating income increased to $105 million or 29% of revenue. And we delivered a 25% free cash flow margin on a trailing 12-month basis or 30% on a pretax basis. These results are a testament to our market leadership, the strategic importance of our differentiated platform and the durability of our business model. Jim will share more details about our Q3 performance and fiscal 2024 guidance in a moment. 
In the meantime, I would like to discuss the trends we're seeing in the market, highlights from our Perform customer conference last week and our continued rapid pace of innovation. I'd like to begin with three transformative megatrends that are driving the market. Last week at Perform, we called them Waves.
First, cloud modernization continues to drive workloads to the cloud. Second, the AI revolution is sweeping across industries with the opportunity for enormous advancements in innovation and productivity. And third, the escalating threat landscape is increasing the need for more sophisticated cybersecurity protection. These megatrends are occurring amidst an increasing focus by organizations to leverage digital transformation to drive business transformation. But they also bring sizable challenges such as an explosion of data, a massive increase in its complexity, disconnected tools and a need for better analytics. And it is these challenges, especially with the exponential increase in AI workloads that have moved observability and application security from optional to mandatory. 
But not all observability and application security tools are created equal. In this world of containers, micro services, hybrid and multi-cloud environments as well as limited resources, it is no longer feasible to use dashboards, alerts and manual triage to manage these workloads . Given this landscape, our approach is radically different in three critical respects.
First, the Dynatrace platform enables contextual analytics. We will store all data types, logs, traces, metrics, real user data, business events and others in Grail, an integrated, highly performing and massively scalable data store. By keeping all of these data types together in context, we are able to analyze billions of interdependencies across applications, networks and infrastructure throughout the enterprise. These dependencies are continuously captured, providing virtually instant end-to-end awareness that is not possible to replicate without a unified data store. 
Our second key differentiator is our hypermodal AI. For over a decade, Dynatrace customers have relied on the predictive and causal AI techniques of our AI engine, Davis. We expect to make our generative AI capabilities available on the platform through Davis copilot beginning this quarter, thereby bringing the Dynatrace platform to a much wider array of end users. These three AI techniques together deliver a game-changing solution with each making the other eternally more intelligent.
Our third key differentiator is automation. Organizations want broad-based situational awareness and analytics that can lead to an auto remediation of issues. Dynatrace one agent automatically discovers an entire cloud environment, dynamically instruments applications and consistently learns and updates without human scripting or user configuration. The result is a trusted foundation that supports workflows to automate resource optimization and progressive delivery, eliminating the need for manual troubleshooting. This is especially critical during business-impacting incidents.
Contextual analytics, hypermodal AI and automation are three key reasons why Dynatrace is considered a visionary leader in the market. And our customers view these elements as essential in enabling them to navigate the challenges brought on by digital transformation, an explosion of generative AI and the growing threat landscape. These differentiators enable us to deliver actionable answers, rapid resolution and incident prevention. They also drive purchasing behavior for customers across a variety of use cases, including enterprise-wide tool consolidation, cloud native application performance, faster software delivery, cost-effective log management at scale and secure cloud applications. 
These trends, differentiators and advantages were certainly top of mind last week at our Perform conference in Las Vegas. It was a tremendously exhilarating event, where we hosted over 2,000 people in person, including customers, prospects and partners plus thousands more virtually. If you weren't able to participate, I encourage you to watch the replay of our main stage presentations and breakout sessions. We, along with several customers and partners, share insights on how these trends and challenges can present business transformation opportunities for customers, especially in the areas of driving innovation, optimizing cost and mitigating risk.
One example of how Dynatrace is helping innovation was from TD Bank. They drive to deliver legendary experiences for their customers, requiring consistently high application availability and performance. They found that by reducing a myriad of tool sets down to one, the team can now focus on driving innovation rather than maintaining complex relationships among tools.
Lloyds Banking Group share their story of optimizing cost. They have teamed up with Dynatrace to measure and reduce proactively the carbon footprint of their IT ecosystem. Lloyds Bank is a thought leader in their approach to sustainability, looking to reduce the direct carbon emissions in their operational sectors by at least 75%. Dynatrace has helped Lloyds assess its IT carbon emissions, see where their sustainable efforts are most impactful and identify meaningful opportunities to optimize their digital infrastructure. 
A standout example showcasing our ability to mitigate risk comes from the largest application security win in our history, which we closed in Q3. A leading global payment technology company chose Dynatrace because of our ability to immediately identify impactful common vulnerabilities, provide contextual understanding of criticality and pinpoint the exact location of their vulnerabilities, something their existing security tooling was not able to do. It is a fantastic mode of confidence in our security product from a very large organization. 
As customers look for ways to drive innovation, optimize cost and mitigate risk, they know that consolidating their existing observability tools in standardizing on a unified platform is the optimal way to do it. As such, another great story from Perform last week came from the VP of Engineering at PicPay, Brazil's financial ecosystem app. He shared his experience using Dynatrace to help them achieve platform observability at massive scale. This encompasses 35 million users and hundreds of Kubernetes clusters with thousands of nodes. PicPay is a newer customer for Dynatrace. They realized that using multiple tools is costly and inefficient. With Dynatrace, they gained the benefits of visibility and automation through a single-unified platform. 
PicPay is not alone. We are seeing increased demand in large strategic deals where customers are looking to make broader observability architecture decisions. We believe Dynatrace is in a great position to benefit from this trend, given our proven track record of helping customers eliminates siloed tools, significantly improve software availability and performance, reduce cost and drive organizational innovation and productivity. While these deals are a positive sign of future growth potential, near term, these larger deals add a degree of variability as customers require more time to make these strategic decisions. 
We view this increasing trend to consolidate existing observability tools and standardize them on a unified platform as a significant opportunity for us. As such, we are continuing to invest in strategic go-to-market areas such as GSI partnerships, demand generation and targeted sales capacity while also continuing to prioritize investments in R&D.
In addition to the frictionless sales motion that we are driving with hyperscaler partners, we are seeing early positive signs of traction with the investments we've made with GSI partners, such as Accenture, Deloitte, DXC and Kyndryl. It was through one such GSI that we closed a 7-figure Q3 win with a major social media platform. The customer was looking to gain end-to-end visibility into their incredibly complex environment. Our ability to demonstrate the power of AI and automation to greatly reduce outages while saving costs drove the opportunity. We plan to continue to invest in these partnerships, to generate pipeline and gain efficiency as we maintain our focus on scaling the business. 
We also plan to continue our investment in targeted sales capacity in the fourth quarter, weighting our resources toward the higher end of our target Global 15,000 market where the propensity to spend is far greater. We are confident that with the evolution of our go-to-market leadership team, we have the right skills and proven track record to scale the team and build the brand to seize this market opportunity. 
I'd also like to call out the exciting addition in January of Laura Heisman, the former CMO at VMware  as our new Chief Marketing Officer. In addition to our targeted go-to-market investments, we plan to continue investing in our R&D engine to extend our technology leadership position. The team's relentless focus on market-leading innovation was evident last week with the plethora of announcements and new solutions we unveiled to enhance our platform. 
First, we announced the availability of Dynatrace AI observability, which enables customers to embrace AI confidently by providing insights into all layers of AI-powered applications, including large language models and generative AI to manage cost, experience, reliability and security.
Second, we announced Dynatrace open pipeline to empower customers with full control of data at the point of ingest, helping customers boost security, ease management and maximize the value of data.
And third, we announced Dynatrace data observability to help ensure that data collected through external sources outside of our one agent such as open telemetry, business systems and through Dynatrace APIs is reliable and accurate for business analytics, smart cloud orchestration and reliable automation. We believe these platform enhancements provide further monetization opportunities as customers drive more usage, more ingest, more storage and most notably, more queries and business analytics. 
Before I turn the call over to Jim, I wanted to comment on our plans to acquire Runecast. Adding Runecast to the platform will extend Dynatrace contextual security protection and analytics with Runecast's security posture management. This will enable customers to address the risk of misconfigurations and compliance violations in hybrid and multi-cloud ecosystems based on AI-driven and automated real-time vulnerability assessments. Additionally, it will allow customers to perform threat detection and incident response with full context, detailing their security vulnerabilities, affected applications and attack factors. We are thrilled to welcome this talented team to our R&D organization.
In closing, our Q3 results reflect the ongoing demand for automated observability and application security solutions. The durability of our business model and our ability to execute successfully in an evolving marketplace. Our unified platform with contextual analytics, hypermodal AI and automation differentiates us in the market and positions us well relative to competitive alternatives. We believe the market is moving toward us with a desire for fewer solutions, better insights and actionable answers leading to rapid incident resolution and prevention. And we plan to continue to invest strategically in go-to-market areas as well as R&D innovation to capture market opportunity and drive ongoing leadership while maintaining our commitment to balance growth, profitability and free cash flow. 
Jim, over to you. Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As Rick mentioned, Q3 marks another quarter of solid execution by the Dynatrace team as we once again surpassed the high end of our top line growth and profitability guidance metrics. 
Our continued ability to execute successfully in this dynamic environment is a testament to the growing criticality of observability and application security in the market. Our platform differentiation, the value proposition we provide to customers and the ongoing durability of our business model. 
Now let me review the third quarter results in more detail. Please note the growth rates mentioned will be year-over-year and in constant currency, unless otherwise stated.
Starting with annual recurring revenue, or ARR, total ARR for the third quarter was $1.43 billion, an increase of $263 million compared to the same period last year, representing 21% growth year-over-year. Net new ARR on a constant currency basis was $70 million in the quarter. In Q3, we added 209 new logos to the Dynatrace platform, roughly consistent with the year ago quarter. As I have shared in the past, we are focused on the quality of new logo lands that have a greater propensity to expand. In Q3, average ARR per new logo came in at roughly $140,000 on a trailing 12-month basis, consistent with Q2 and up 17% year-over-year. 
We continue to attract enterprise customers that are outgrowing their existing DIY or commercial tooling solutions, seeking business value in tool consolidation and coming to Dynatrace for the depth, breadth and automation of our unified observability platform. Our gross retention rate remained best-in-class in our industry in the mid-90s and contributed to a net retention rate of 113% in the third quarter, coming in at the high end of our expectations. 
When we think about our net retention rate, there are three areas that drive customer expansion. One, growth of existing observability workloads; two, adding new observability workloads; and three, cross-selling new solutions like log management, analytics or application security. 
We estimate that our customers are observing only 20% to 30% of their workloads today. We believe these three growth vectors provide us with significant opportunity to expand further within our installed customer base. And as we have highlighted last week at Perform, our innovation engine continues to deliver enhanced platform solutions to increase our upsell and cross-sell opportunities.
In addition, we believe our DPS licensing model will further contribute to growth in the net retention rate over time as customers gain greater access to newer solutions and encounter less friction in the buying process. We continue to see strong momentum and interest in this type of contracting model. In Q3, we closed over 150 DPS deals globally, bringing total DPS customers to roughly 400, representing more than 10% of our customer base. 
Moving on to revenue. Total revenue for the third quarter was $365 million, up 21% year-over-year and $6 million above the high end of guidance. And subscription revenue for the third quarter was $348 million, up 23% year-over-year and $8 million above the high end of guidance. 
With respect to margins, non-GAAP gross margin for the third quarter was 85%, consistent with the prior quarter and up 100 basis points from Q3 of last year, driven by ongoing cloud hosting efficiency efforts. Our non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter was $105 million, $8 million above the high end of our guidance, driven by the combination of revenue upside and disciplined expense management. This resulted in a non-GAAP operating margin of 29%, exceeding the top end of guidance by 200 basis points. Non-GAAP net income was $96 million or $0.32 per diluted share. This was $0.04 above the high end of our guidance range, driven by the items I just highlighted and a slightly lower tax rate driven by several discrete items related to additional foreign tax credits and incentives. 
Our free cash flow was $67 million in the third quarter. As we've discussed in the past, we believe it is best to view free cash flow over a trailing 12-month period due to seasonality and variability in billings quarter-to-quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow was $340 million or 25% of revenue. As a reminder, this includes 500 basis points of impact related to cash taxes. Pretax free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was 30% of revenue and up 43% year-over-year.
Finally, we ended the third quarter with a robust balance sheet, including $783 million of cash and zero debt. 
Before I move to the guidance details, I want to give you a brief update on the demand environment and trends we are seeing. The observability market opportunity is growing. The demand environment remains healthy and our pipeline continues to grow at a faster pace than our reported ARR growth rate. More specifically, within the sales funnel, we are seeing a growing number of larger and more strategic deals related to observably architecture and vendor consolidation initiatives, and we expect this directional heading to continue. 
To give you a sense of the magnitude of this trend, the number of deals in the pipeline greater than $1 million of ACV, both new logo and installed base has increased 39% compared to the same quarter last year. We view the growing number of these deals as a sign that the increasing complexity of managing fragmented tools is becoming unmanageable, and customers are looking for a partner to help them drive business value in tool consolidation. And we believe our highly differentiated unified platform with contextual analytics, AI leadership and data-driven automation position us well to capture these opportunities. 
At the same time, given the larger values of these strategic deals and the C-level approvals that they require, they introduced increased variability in terms of timing required to close. As such, we believe it is best to be incrementally more prudent in our near-term guidance. 
And with that in mind, let's start with our updated guidance for the full year with growth rates in constant currency. We are lowering our ARR guidance by 100 basis points from our prior guidance to account for the incremental level of prudence related to the timing of the large strategic deals I just mentioned. We now expect ARR to be $1.485 billion to $1.495 billion or 18% to 19% growth year-over-year. As a reminder, we had $13 million of ARR expansions associated with early renewals in the fourth quarter last year. It was the first time in our history as a public company where we saw a sequential increase over our seasonally strongest third quarter, making for a difficult year-over-year compare this Q4. 
Given our strong Q3 finish for revenue, we are raising our revenue guidance by approximately $11 million at the midpoint to $1.422 billion and $1.427 billion, up 50 basis points from our prior guidance and representing 22% growth year-over-year. We are raising our subscription revenue guidance by approximately $16 million at the midpoint to $1.352 billion to $1.357 billion or 24% growth year-over-year. This represents an increase of 150 basis points from our prior guidance. 
Turning to our bottom line. The strength and resilience of our financial model is evident in our ongoing margin performance. We are committed to investing in future growth opportunities that we expect will drive long-term value while also optimizing costs to drive profitability. We continue to rebalance our cost profile to prioritize our investments in R&D innovation, CSM coverage and strategic go-to-market areas such as GSI partnership, demand generation activities and targeted sales capacity. 
With this in mind, we are raising our full year non-GAAP operating income guidance, $9 million. This translates to non-GAAP operating margin guidance of 27.25% to 27.5%, representing an increase of 25 basis points at the low end of the range and 50 basis points at the high end of the range.
We are raising non-GAAP EPS guidance to $1.16 to $1.18 per diluted share, representing an increase of $0.06 at the midpoint of the range. This non-GAAP EPS is based on a diluted share count of 299 million to 300 million shares. We are raising our free cash flow guidance to $330 million to $335 million, an increase of $16 million at the midpoint, representing a free cash flow margin of 23% of revenue, up 50 basis points at the midpoint. And finally, this guidance assumes the acquisition of Runecast, which we expect will close by March 31. This technology tuck-in transaction will not have a material impact on our financial results. 
Looking at Q4, we expect total revenue to be between $372 million and $377 million or 18% to 19% growth. Subscription revenue is expected to be between $353 million and $358 million, up 20% to 21% year-over-year. From a profit standpoint, non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $85 million and $90 million or 23% to 24% of revenue. Keep in mind, we have some seasonal expenses taking place in the fourth quarter, including incremental spend for our Perform customer conference as well as a structural reset of payroll taxes. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.26 to $0.28 per diluted share. 
In summary, we are pleased with our third quarter fiscal '24 performance. We have a proven track record of disciplined execution, balancing top line growth with profitability and free cash flow. We are building incremental prudence in our near-term outlook, while we remain optimistic about our intermediate-term growth opportunities and our growing differentiation in the market. 
And with that, we will open the line for questions. Operator? Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jake Roberge with William Blair. Rick, you've talked the past two quarters about the incremental go-to-market investments you're making. Can you talk about what you're seeing in the top of funnel and pipeline activity that continues to give you confidence to make those investments? Sure, Jake. Thanks for the question. The short form is we continue to see pipeline growth in advance or higher than our ARR growth. So that's one element. As Jim indicated in his remarks, we see increasing deal size for increased deal sizes really across the board. These are strategic deals. They take a little bit longer to close, but we feel very positive about the pipeline growth that we're seeing at the moment. Our next question is from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Great. Like net new ARR growth has been [indiscernible] the best for the last kind of 5 or 6 quarters. What needs to improve, execution, economy or both to get back to a more steady growth cadence there? Well, I would say that the pipeline coverage continues to grow. So that's a positive. We see, as I mentioned in the answer to the prior question, pipeline growth exceeding ARR growth, so that's good. We need to be able to convert that pipeline at a higher rate, and that's going to come with macro improvement that occurs over time. And also, obviously, with sales execution against these larger deals and larger transactions that we mentioned. Our next question is from the line of Patrick Colville with Scotiabank. I mean one of the juicy metrics you gave this quarter was the 150 DPS deals. I think you called out that 10% of customers are now in DPS. I mean, I guess, what impact is DPS having on NRR, if at all already? And if it's not having any impact right now, can you just give us a framework as to like when we think DPS might impact NRR ? Thank you, Patrick. This is Jim. So for DPS, we've talked about this before. What the DPS contracting vehicle gives you is it gives you an ability to get full access to the platform with a unified rate card to a rate card for all of our capabilities as opposed to buying it on a SKU basis. So you commit to a dollar amount for a term and you draw down based on consumption against this rate card. So you can leverage all capabilities on the platform.
So because of that, it's a much more frictionless buying experience. So Patrick, the timing of when you get expansion is you get them on the platform and the expectation, and we've proven this with -- we've had DPS unlimited availability for probably 1.5 years now. And what we have found is that customers that are on such a contracting vehicle consume faster. So when they consume faster, it means it leads to incremental expansion rates.
We're at the very early phase of this. This has been generally available since April. So we're kind of -- I would say where you're going to begin to see this is when you start to see lapsing, call it, in the kind of roughly 12-month horizon. So we track it. And what we do see is that customers that are on a DPS contract consume faster than those that are not on a DPS contract. So our expectation is that we'll see that, but it will probably be in the fiscal '25 period. Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Good to see you work up on stage making Waves. My question has to do with the timing of the large deals and the close process. Is the pipeline for new ARR is up 39%, then you've got DPS potentially kicking in next year. I'm curious, if you think the next fiscal year, which starts in a few months from now, could show better growth rates than this fiscal year, which obviously is a lagging indicator of the investments you've made in your new products, which [indiscernible] performed, where you expand go-to-market capacity and then towards large deals and the DPS, obviously. Yes. This is Jim. I'll take that. Obviously, we're not going to provide fiscal '25 guidance on this call. I would say the thesis of the various areas that you talked about, certainly are growth drivers. I'm not going to comment on whether that leads to an acceleration in fiscal '25.
But what I will say, just to make sure that I was clear in the prepared remarks that when you step back and you say, what has fundamentally changed in the last 90 days relative to the pipeline? The pipeline remains strong. We have a growing number of very large vendor consolidation opportunities that I mentioned. So I'd say it's a net positive for Dynatrace because what we're seeing in the market is a trend towards customers doing or considering more tool consolidation, vendor consolidation because of the complexity of the environment of having a bunch of disparate tools. So this is a net positive we believe, for Dynatrace.
The only thing that has changed is that we are building an incremental level of prudence knowing that these deal sizes are very large. They're strategic and the timing for closing them can be a bit variable to pick within a 3-month window. So all we've done is, we tried to build a level of incremental prudence into the guide. There is no change in the demand environment. The demand environment remains healthy. Kash, let me just add to that. First of all, thanks very much for attending Perform, that's exceptional. What I would say simply is that the market fundamentals here remain, in our view, very strong. And we like our position based on contextual analytics, hypermodal AI and automation to take advantage of a market that really requires this degree of automation to evolve because the number of IT resources that are available to do manual processing of IT workloads is constrained and observability, in particular, sophisticated observability and application security solutions like Dynatrace's are going to become more and more critical, in fact, mission critical in this market as we look at. Our next question is from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. And it was nice to be at Perform last week. I had a question related to the past couple. If we look at the ARR growth and we layer in various scenarios for logs and analytics and security, it suggested a pretty significant degradation of what we'll call the residual business. And I just wondered, a, is that a fair way to look at it? And b, why do you think that's happening with the growth of your new offerings, again, it suggests a pretty significant degradation of residual for lack of a better word.
And Jim, just a clarification, if you could help set our models for next year. Will cash taxes also have an impact in incremental cash taxes on FY '25? Or is it sort of a one -- more of a onetime thing just so we can at least [ add those to ] the framework for our cash flow for next year? Yes, I'll start with that. So the answer is, cash tax that we've seen, which has been, call it, roughly 500 basis points is going to continue. This is -- fiscal '25 is not a onetime. We are a full cash taxpayer because we are GAAP profitable, and we don't have NOLs or tax loss carryforward. So you should expect that the cash tax that we have in fiscal '25 will continue going forward. Obviously, there's always strategic tax planning efforts that we're going through. But as a general answer, you should expect that, that will continue.
Relative to the... But to say, yes, sorry, just at the same rate though, right? It doesn't get incrementally worse. So it's the same, right... I would say I'm not going to guide for fiscal '25. But I will tell you that as you become more profitable, you're going to pay more taxes. So whether that rate grows a little bit or not, I'm not going to say, but it's going to be at a minimum, what it currently is at. Okay. Fair. And relative to ARR, we don't unpack for you at a level of detail all the product categories. So I think I would kind of remind you a bit that we are still on the early phase of the journey for application security and for logs. So we've talked about those businesses exiting fiscal '25 being at $100 million ARR. We've been at AppSec a little bit longer than logs.
The -- but the point is that what you're going to see is we talked about logs in particular, that log starts with the POC. It then goes to a kind of smaller workloads in a production environment. The next phase in that journey is you have newer workloads in a production environment.
And then the last phase being you're kind of leveraging existing workloads. So we're still in the very early phases of that journey. So when you think about our kind of product cuts that today, logs and AppSec don't make up a material portion of our ARR. Certainly, the areas that we've been strong in all along around full stack infrastructure, DEM. Those continue to be the horses that drive most of ARR.
And I'd say what you should expect is that we're going to continue to see an acceleration in application security and in logs, but the hockey stick, so to speak, will happen in fiscal '25, that's our expectation. Keith, I might add that quarter-over-quarter, we saw a 50% increase in paying logs, customers -- log management customers and an additional 30% increase in POCs on log management. So we do continue to see traction in this new offering. Our next question is from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. I guess for either of you, regarding the ARR commentary, and I think the uncertainty of large deal timing, did any abnormal large deals push out of the quarter? And I guess, are there things that either your sales force or partners are focused on to accelerate the closing of -- what sounds like a growing pipeline of these large deals that could ultimately start to have a positive impact on growth? Yes. I guess I will take that. Relative to these deals that we're seeing and whether they had kind of some of them that pushed out of Q3, I'd say you always have deals that push out of a quarter that you pull into a quarter. But I would say nothing, Matt, that's like notable. These are deals that, as you can imagine, they've been in the funnel. They don't happen overnight. And as they progress, you get a better assessment of kind of the deal size and the deal timing.
And the good news is these deals, many of them have been growing as we've been working through the sales process. So we're actually in a good position relative to the health of the funnel. The only thing that has fundamentally changed is, as I mentioned, the timing. And the challenge with deals like these is there's not always a kind of compelling event for a specific date for them to close because if you're doing a vendor consolidation decision. There may be a kind of the timing of maybe a competitor solution that may have a contract up for renewal. So that may be one element of a compelling event.
But in general, that these are very strategic decisions for customers and so there is a serious and significant evaluation when they go through that. And we're just building an incremental level of prudence that nothing, as I said before, nothing has fundamentally changed in the demand environment is still healthy. The pipeline is still very robust.
As I mentioned in my prepared remarks that these deals that are over $1 million have -- in the pipeline are up over 39%. And I remind you that we had a huge Q4 last year. So this is a significant movement in the pipeline. It's just a matter of when you have very large deals like this to call it within a 90-day window is a little bit more variable. We tried to build a level of prudence into it. I would just add, Matt, that with GSIs in particular, since you mentioned the partner front, we continue to be very enthusiastic about the evolution of the GSI partner opportunities, especially with some of the core GSIs I mentioned, like Accenture, Deloitte, DXC and Kyndryl. And those deals are inherently going to be bigger and take a bit longer to close as well. But we feel very good about our posture and position associated with the GSI evolution. Our next question is from the line of Mike Cikos with Needham & Company. And I know a lot has been made on the ARR guide. And I just -- I really want to fine-tune it. I know, Jim, you've spoken about incorporating incremental prudence tied to these larger, more strategic deals. So the first question is, can you elaborate on what the magnitude of that incremental prudence is? I think that would help level set expectations as we're thinking about this change to the guidance philosophy or construction now.
And then the second point, which would go a long way in helping investors think about the guidance today, really, were it not for these larger, more strategic deals, which are taking longer to close. Excluding that, would management actually be raising the fiscal '24 constant currency ARR guidance today? Well, you can imagine, the pipeline is just a basket of opportunities. There's large opportunities, small opportunities. So I think what we are seeing though is the funnel is becoming a bit more weighted to these large opportunities. And I will tell you that the guide that I provided last time, which was 19% to 20% growth, in the guide now, 18% to 19%, the way you should think about that is the difference in that of 100 basis points is literally just incremental improvements. Nothing else has fundamentally changed. Terrific. I appreciate it. Our next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani with Citi. Jim, just along these lines, historically, it's been very helpful for us to internalize your growth algorithm between new logo acquisition and the installed base expansion. So just bearing in mind some of your commentary on some of the expansionary behavior, the DPS uptake and what you're seeing in the pipeline, I was hoping you could help us flesh out for us what your expectations are as it relates to a new logo business versus a potential recovery on the installed base expansion side? Yes. The way to -- I think I shared this before, that -- and I shared it in the last call that we thought that expansion rates would be in the 112% to 113% range in the near term. And I expect that to be the case for the remainder of this year. And we had said before that we're probably going to be in the low single-digit growth in new logos, but at higher land sizes. So our land sizes have been call it, roughly 140,000 on a trailing 12-month basis.
So those two underpinnings continue to be kind of the building blocks underneath that. And on the new logo front, it's because we're focusing on a larger set of customer lands that we have seen have a higher propensity to expand when we land at a larger size, they tend to expand. So those fundamentals won't change.
Obviously, when I provide fiscal '25 guidance, I'll give you guys a little bit more color on that, but those continue to be the kind of the major building blocks. And obviously, the other one being we continue to have best-in-class retention rate. So the product is very sticky. We don't have a lot of churn or down sell. So obviously, we don't expect any changes in that regard either. Our next question is from the line of Ray McDonough with Guggenheim. Rick, when we talk to some of your partners, it does seem like tool consolidation is accelerating, and you've hit on that throughout the call. But is that acceleration due to a change in control at a couple of your competitors? And if so, can you help us understand where those opportunities are coming from specifically? Is it some of your traditional APM competitors? Or are you seeing displacement opportunities in log management and other areas at this point? Obviously, you mentioned it's still early on for logs, but any color would be helpful. Thanks, Ray. I would say a bit of all of the above by way of tool consolidation. AppDynamics continues to be a source of new logos for us in a material way. New Relic going private, certainly has created some disruption as has the acquisition of Splunk by Cisco, which creates certainly some degree of market confusion and apprehension that leads to opportunity for us. Having said that, it's all still relatively early stage in terms of some of these transaction announcements, and we'll have to see how they evolve over the course of time. Our next question comes from the line of Gray Powell with BTIG. Okay. Great. Thanks for -- let me ask a question here. So yes, I know you've gotten a lot on net new ARR trends. The statistic on $1 million ACV deals, that was really helpful. Is there a way to just help us think through like how much -- like what the normal sales cycle is for larger deals? And then just how much it's been extending in recent quarters as customers take on more like multiproduct deals? Yes. The -- I mean, our normal sales cycle is 6 to 9 months, as you can imagine, that -- and it depends upon the -- whether it's a new logo or an expansion. If it's a new logo, you're going to be on the longer end of that because customers are doing a much more significant evaluation with the POC and things of that nature. So it varies between expansions and new logos.
And as I mentioned, Gray, that both -- these growing number of larger deals are not just new logos. We're actually seeing it also on the installed base side. So it's actually both. Because even where we have installed base customers, they also are leveraging DIY tools and in other cases, other commercial tooling solutions. So they are now beginning to make more tool consolidation decisions. And as I mentioned, the funnel is showing a 39% increase in that, and that's over kind of a year ago period that was very, very healthy. So I think it's a positive trend.
I would tell you that it does introduce a level of variability, as I mentioned, which is why we built more prudence into -- and it's hard to say, is it a month? Is it two months? It varies, right? It varies by -- in some cases, it could be a quarter. In some cases, it could be a month. I really couldn't tell you an average for it other than to say that when you are doing deals of this size, where -- because there is both people and process implications for customers because if they're using existing tools and they want to go to a new vendor, it has an impact on their organization, and it has an impact on the processes within their organization. So there's a serious evaluation that they go through, and you have to anticipate that as you're trying to determine a close date. Got it. So it's like an extra month to three months, not like an extra 6 months, is that fair? No, no, no. Our next question comes from the line of Joel Fishbein with Truist Securities. I have a follow-up to one of the earlier questions around the observability consolidation, which we're seeing in the market as well. Can you talk about the vendors that you think are positioned to compete with you on those observability deals? We hear ServiceNow making some noise and there are some others out there. I just want to know the competitive dynamics of those -- and you went to some great lengths to talk about your competitive differentiation, which we saw last week as well. So I'd love to hear, Rick, from you about who you're seeing in the market. Well, I talked about some of the competitors already to some extent, I think, that are providing some opportunity based on the disruption in those areas. To extend that further, I would say, again, that I very much like our position recently these trends towards larger strategic deals based upon our core differentiation, especially at the higher end of the market.
And you had asked about ServiceNow. We actually still see them mostly as a partner as opposed to a competitor in the market. They just don't have the capabilities yet in observability and application security that we do. So it's more times than not, customers are asking us to integrate with ServiceNow versus compete with them. Are there any other vendors that you think can match you guys from a consolidation perspective from a product perspective? Well, at the high end of the market -- the higher end of the market at the Global 15,000, I would say that most of the deal flow and pipeline moves our direction. So in our target market segment, I think we have a very strong play and the biggest competitor, as we've said in the past, continues to be DIY. Our next question is from the line of Adam Tindle with Raymond James. I wanted to ask a strategic question related to Runecast. To start with, the motivation for that was posture management something that customers were asking before adopting AppSec or would you characterize this as maybe the start of a broader push into CNAPP.
And then secondly, into that, just zooming out your kind of strategic view on cloud security, broadly speaking. There's been a lot of investment and a lot of growth in that space, a combination of agent and agentless technologies going on. I wonder where you think Dynatrace plays in that market? Do you see a holistic platform like a [ wiz ] type of player over time or attractive areas that you're going to pick and choose your spots? Thanks, Adam. So first on the CNAPP front, I would say, yes, the intent here is to head towards CNAPP and use cloud security posture management as a way to escalate our vulnerability analytics capabilities that we have, and we really, really liked the Runecast team and technology, I should say, we like that technology and team quite a lot. It adds AI and contextual security protection analytics into what we're doing, which fits nicely into our portfolio, and in particular, it allows us to address the risks of misconfigurations and compliance violations added to our existing vulnerability analytics capabilities. So it is a very, very good fit in expanding it.
The broader question you asked, I would simply say that we continue -- we have mentioned time and time again in the past to see that observability and application security are converging. And the capabilities that we deliver in our platform generally with regard to things like contextual analytics and hypermodal AI, provide very, very strong capabilities in application security as well.
So in the outside market, we've been focused on leveraging the core elements of our observability platform to do application security better than others in the market in these types of spaces. So we are very enthusiastic about Runecast also continue to be very excited about our investments in AppSec generally. Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Will Power with Robert W. Baird. I guess, Rick, it would be great to get your perspective on kind of tone of customer conversations that Perform being fresh here. Can you just -- how customers that you're talking to are thinking about, I guess, both budgets and priorities as we kind of head into 2024 here? And then any perspective with respect to how any of that might have changed versus those conversations a year ago? Well, I would simply say that, obviously, Perform customers are a bit self-selected. They are existing -- generally existing Dynatrace customers or Dynatrace prospects. They've chosen to be there. So you get that flavor of the market.
Having said that, I would say that the conversations with a customer after customer after customer at Perform were absolutely exceptional. And the engagement was phenomenal. They are absolutely leaned in with regard to Dynatrace and the investments they're making in the Dynatrace platform, and they buy off on this notion that: number one, observability is becoming more and more critical amidst a world in which digital transformation is driving business transformation. And number two, that they can't do it in a manual way through dashboards and alerting, which leads to number three, that they need a platform that is driving analytics, AI and automation to enable them to do it better than they could do otherwise. And so that was the type of feedback that we heard is extremely positive. It was simply a fantastic event.
All right. That brings us to the close. I wanted to thank you all for your engaged questions as usual and your ongoing support. We -- as we've echoed throughout the course of this call, remain quite bullish about the opportunity that lies ahead. We look forward to connecting with you at upcoming IR events over the coming weeks, and we wish you all a very good day. Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time, log off your webcast, and thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day.","today's earnings press release and supplemental presentation are posted in our financial results section of our IR website . the forward-looking statements contained in this call represent the company's views on February 8, 2024 . unless otherwise noted, the growth rates we discuss are non-GAAP .",0.0

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Noelle Faris, Vice President of Investor Relations for Dynatrace. Thank you. You may begin. Good morning, and thank you for joining Dynatrace's Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Rick McConnell, Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Chief Financial Officer.
Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements such as statements regarding revenue, earnings guidance and economic conditions. Actual results may differ materially from our expectations due to a number of risks and uncertainties discussed in Dynatrace's SEC filings, including our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q and our upcoming annual report on Form 10-K that we plan to file later this month.
The forward-looking statements contained in this call represent the company's views on May 15, 2024. We assume no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information, future events or circumstances. Unless otherwise noted, the growth rates we discuss today are non-GAAP reflecting constant currency growth rate, and per share amounts are on a diluted basis. We will also discuss other non-GAAP financial measures on today's call. To see reconciliations between non-GAAP and GAAP measures, please refer to today's earnings press release and supplemental presentation, which are both posted in the Financial Results section of our IR website.
And with that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Rick McConnell. Thanks, Noelle, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for today's call. Dynatrace delivered a very strong finish to fiscal 2024, having achieved several noteworthy milestones and accomplishments. We surpassed $1.5 billion in ARR, representing 50% growth compared to the $1 billion level 2 years ago. We landed our first 9-figure TCV deal. We closed our largest new logo ever, a nearly 8-figure ACV deal. Top analyst firms named Dynatrace a leader 9 times in reports on observability and AI ops over the past year. And during fiscal 2024, we added approximately 300 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin from fiscal 2023 plus grew pretax free cash flow margins by 200 basis points.
There are 3 key themes I'd like to highlight as we begin today's call: first, we are confident that our end-to-end platform is a meaningful differentiator in the expanding observability market; second, we are benefiting from the evolution toward larger, more strategic observability architecture and vendor consolidation initiatives, and we expect this trend to persist; and third, we continue to execute with a business model that is well balanced in growth and profitability.
Jim will share more details about our Q4 and FY '24 performance, fiscal 2025 guidance and the share repurchase program we announced earlier today in a moment. In the meantime, I would like to discuss some of the key wins in the quarter, the market opportunity, investments in ongoing platform innovation and our go-to-market evolution.
Starting with some notable wins. Last quarter, we shared that we were seeing increased demand or large strategic deals in which customers were looking to make broader observability architecture decisions. Our thesis was that Dynatrace is uniquely positioned to benefit from this trend, given our proven track record of helping customers eliminate siloed tools, significantly improve software performance and user experience, reduce cost and drive organizational innovation and productivity.
Our Q4 results showed that this thesis played out as we had expected. We successfully closed numerous platform consolidation deals, contributing to a record 18 7-figure ACV wins in the quarter. Among these were the following: we won a 9-figure, multiyear TCV expansion with a top 20 global financial institution. In a POC, the customer found Dynatrace to have the most advanced offering for cloud and container environments, resulting in dramatically reduced time and cost to prevent and resolve incidents. I'm also very pleased that this deal was closed in conjunction with Accenture.
We won a mid- 8-figure TCV expansion deal with a Fortune 50 corporation. This company is in the process of moving to the cloud, and selected Dynatrace to displace their existing monitoring solutions. As part of their digital transformation efforts, they are aiming to have 70% of their applications and 75% of their data in public or private clouds by the end of the year. Dynatrace's end-to-end observability platform was selected to provide a view across their entire hybrid and multi-cloud environment.
We landed a nearly 8-figure ACV new logo with one of the world's largest airlines. It is yet another tool consolidation win, but what ultimately led to this selection was our focus on their business transformation initiatives and how Dynatrace could help them seamlessly transport more than 0.5 million passengers every day.
And we won a 7-figure expansion deal with a large health care company that is seeking to enable its developers to focus on innovation rather than performance issues or vulnerabilities. Dynatrace's real-time vulnerability analytics and contextual awareness prove the perfect fit and made up nearly half of this expansion deal.
We believe that these types of larger strategic deals will be a material contributor to our long-term growth. And while we are extremely pleased with a number of these large, strategic deals that closed in the quarter, they do come with an increased level of their ability that will continue to necessitate a prudent approach to guidance.
Interest for our newer offerings, including log monitoring and application security also continues to grow, especially for those customers leveraging our Dynatrace Platform Subscription or DPS contract vehicle. The airline deal I just mentioned is our largest DPS transaction to date, and they are already leveraging log monitoring. In Q4, approximately 70% of our new logo deals were closed with DPS licensing. And we've increased the number of DPS customers from 100 to over 700 since DPS became generally available just over a year ago.
DPS is now our default offering for new logos, and we are driving increased penetration in our installed base. While it is still early, consumption for DPS customers is growing at a significantly faster rate than our ARR growth. Also of note, partner momentum is building. 15 of these 18 7-figure deals were closed in collaboration with partners, especially GSIs and hyperscalers.
Turning next to the market. We believe that our success in closing anchor deals provides evidence of the tailwind in what is already a large and growing space. Cloud modernization and GenAI are additional catalysts. Two weeks ago, AWS, Azure and GCP reported a combined annualized revenue of nearly $220 billion, growing 24% year-over-year.
Each of the hyperscalers mentioned the underlying growth drivers of workloads moving to cloud as well as GenAI. Andy Jassy from Amazon stated that 85% or more of the global IT spend remains on premises. And this is before we contemplate GenAI impact. We believe that GenAI will over time, materially increase developer productivity. This, in turn, is expected to result in radically more data as well as complexity, both of which play to the strengths and differentiation of Dynatrace given our more than a decade of leadership in AI.
On the innovation front, we see our R&D engine as driving an ongoing stream of technology advancements. Last year, we released a game-changing platform evolution with Grail, an integrated, highly performant and massively scalable data store that keeps all data types, metrics, logs, traces, really user data, business events together in context, providing near real-time end-to-end awareness. 
Grail serves as the foundation for all of our solutions, including full stack infrastructure, log monitoring and application security. Throughout fiscal 2024, the team's relentless focus on market-leading innovation was evident with the plethora of platform enhancements that provide further monetization opportunities in core as well as adjacent areas. We believe the Dynatrace platform is highly differentiated and delivers unmatched business value in driving the business transformation initiatives that executives care most about. 
Our platform is integrated from the front end to the back end. We have a single, underlying data store where each of the solutions access that data store through the same set of core technologies. We have the industry's leading causal and predictive AI technologies, along with automation that provides precise answers in context.
In contrast, our peers generally have a series of separate data stores that are aggregated only at the user interface level through manual error-prone tagging. This may be effective for SMB companies but large, complex enterprises recognize the value of Dynatrace's end-to-end platform with automation and AI, enabling them to deliver much more performance software in a highly enriched end-user experience.
We continue to receive exceptional third-party recognition of our platform and resultant market leadership. Most recently, we were named a leader in the 2024 GigaOM Radar report for cloud observability solutions, positioned as the vendor closest to the center of the radar. Dynatrace was also recognized as a customer's choice in the 2024 Gartner Peer Insights Voice of the Customer or Digital Experience Monitoring report, the only provider to receive this distinction. We are humbled by this ongoing third-party validation of our strategic differentiation, and we remain committed to our ongoing investment to maintain this leadership position.
Turning last to our go-to-market strategy, we recently hosted our annual kickoff in Orlando with our global sales team. The energy and excitement were at an all-time high. Over the past 10 months, we have added several seasoned leaders with extensive experience scaling large go-to-market functions with the addition of our Chief Revenue Officer, Chief Marketing Officer and SVP of Partner and Alliances. Sales kickoff provided this new leadership team, the opportunity to share their vision and specific plans to execute on our fiscal 2025 go-to-market strategy.
We are enhancing and evolving our go-to-market approach in 3 focal areas to drive deeper penetration within our installed base and better capture and extend our leadership to maximize the opportunity in front of us. First is customer segmentation. We will be increasing the focus of our sales force on the Global 500 and strategic enterprise accounts to drive the highest productivity with the accounts that have the largest potential ARR. Territory and account coverage changes have already been communicated, and we are executing accordingly.
We are also expanding our international reach and sector specialization, consistent with this segmentation approach. And we will be investing in customer success to align these resources to our segmentation mapping to ensure successful deployment, adoption and expansion.
The second go-to-market area, which I mentioned earlier, is our focus on partners. Partners today influence more than 2/3 of our ARR, but they account for only 30% of deal origination, highlighting the enormous white space of opportunity in this area. We are focusing our energy on our highest priority and most impactful partners. We are building a dedicated partner enablement engine to scale our priority partners. And we are simplifying our economic model with partner-neutral compensation and a co-sale approach with hyperscalers to remove friction and drive closer collaboration.
The third and final go-to-market focal area relates to harnessing our competitive differentiation to drive broader market adoption and deeper installed base penetration. We will increasingly focus on end-to-end observability opportunities as we have discussed. We will continue to drive application performance engagements, our traditional sales motion that enables us to land and expand across our customers' workloads. And finally, we will target cloud modernization efforts in which platform engineers and DevOps teams are responsible for how their organizations develop and release software and require complete visibility of data at scale.
In closing, we delivered a fantastic finish to fiscal 2024. And I'd like to thank the approximately 4,700 Dynatracers globally for their incredible commitment to innovation and excellence this past year. As we look to fiscal 2025, I'm highly enthusiastic about our prospects. Finishing where I began, the market for observability and application security is growing rapidly. Our end-to-end platform differentiates us and puts us in a strong competitive position. And finally, we have a solid business model that continues to deliver a strong balance of growth and profitability.
Jim, over to you. Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Q4 was indeed a very strong finish to fiscal 2024. Once again, we surpassed the high end of our top line growth and profitability guidance metrics. Our value proposition continues to resonate as enterprises look to consolidate their siloed monitoring tools into a unified observability platform, specifically architected to address the growing complexity inherent in dynamic, multi-cloud enterprise environments. Our results reflect relentless execution by the Dynatrace team, the criticality of observability and application security in the market and our platform differentiation.
Now let's dive into the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2024 results in more detail. Please note the growth rates mentioned will be on a year-over-year basis and in constant currency, unless otherwise stated.
Beginning with annual recurring revenue, or ARR, in Q4, as Rick mentioned, we surpassed the $1.5 billion threshold for ARR, representing 20% growth. This result was 100 basis points above the high end of guidance, driven primarily by our strong execution, including many of the large, strategic observability architecture vendor consolidation deals we outlined in our last earnings call.
Our EMEA geo, in particular, had a tremendous finish to the year. We added $84 million of constant currency net new ARR in the quarter driven by a record number of 7-figure competitive wins, our largest nearly 8-figure ACV new logo land and our first ever 9-figure TCV expansion. These results clearly demonstrate enterprise customers are choosing Dynatrace for our highly differentiated unified platform with contextual analytics, AI leadership and data-driven automation. We closed 168 new logos in the fourth quarter for a total of 692 new logos for the fiscal year, roughly consistent with a year ago. A number of the 7-figure deals added in the quarter were new logos and contributed to the average new logo land size of roughly $140,000 on a trailing 12-month basis.
As we have shared in the past, we are focused on the quality of new logo lands that have a greater propensity to expand. Our value proposition continues to resonate with enterprise customers that are outgrowing their existing DIY or commercial tooling solutions, seeking business value and tool consolidation and coming to Dynatrace for the depth, breadth and automation of our unified observability platforms.
Once customers experience the benefits of the Dynatrace platform, they are quick to expand their usage. Our average ARR per customer continues to increase and is approaching $400,000, highlighting the business value we provide to customers. Our gross retention rate is in the mid-90s and continues to be best-in-class in our industry and net retention rate, or NRR, was over 111% in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with nearly 4,000 Dynatrace customers, representing an increase of 10% over last year.
Our DPS licensing model continues to see strong traction. As Rick noted, we now have over 700 DPS customers, representing more than 18% of our customer base and over 1/3 of our ARR. We believe our simplified cross-platform DPS licensing model will further contribute to growth in NRR over time as customers can more easily gain greater access to newer solutions, encounter less friction in the buying process and enjoy more flexible, predictable and transparent pricing, all of which should lead to more consumption of the capabilities in the platform and deliver more business value for our customers. 
And while it's still early days for our DPS customers, we're seeing very healthy usage across the platform. In fact, consumption of the platform for DPS customers is growing nearly 2x faster than non-DPS customers and an indication of increasing expansion opportunity in the future.
Turning to our emerging solution areas of logs and application security traction, we now have roughly 600 customers leveraging each of these solutions, and consumption for these offerings is growing very rapidly, north of 100% exiting fiscal 2024. 
As such, we remain confident in our ability to exceed the $100 million annualized revenue thresholds we set for ourselves some time ago. However, based on current consumption trends, it is more likely we will surpass these thresholds during fiscal 2026 rather than the end of fiscal 2025. Nothing has changed relative to the market opportunity or our competitive differentiation. But the increasing market shift away from point solutions to broader end-to-end observability platform decisions is impacting the sequencing and ramping of deploying these new solutions.
Moving on to revenue. Total revenue the fourth quarter was $381 million, 21% growth and $4 million above the high end of our guidance. Subscription revenue for the fourth quarter was $360 million, 22% growth and $2 million above the high end of our guidance. Shifting to margins. Total non-GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter was 84%, consistent with last year. Our non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter was $95 million, $5 million above the high end of guidance due to the combination of revenue upside and disciplined expense management. This resulted in a non-GAAP operating margin of 25%, exceeding the top end of guidance by nearly 100 basis points. Non-GAAP net income was $89 million or $0.30 per diluted share. This is $0.02 above the high end of guidance, primarily driven by the items I just highlighted.
Turning to a quick summary of the financial results for the full year. Total revenue was $1.43 billion, representing 22% growth. Subscription revenue was $1.36 billion, representing 24% growth. Non-GAAP operating income for the year was $398 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 28%. This result is 50 basis points above the high end of guidance and nearly 300 basis points above fiscal 2023 as we have consistently demonstrated our ability to drive further leverage in our business model. Non-GAAP net income for the year was $358 million or $1.20 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP EPS includes an effective cash tax rate of 17.4%.
Turning to the balance sheet. As of March 31, we had $883 million of cash and investments and 0 debt. Our free cash flow was $121 million in the fourth quarter and $346 million for the full year or 24% of revenue, exceeding the high end of guidance by 100 basis points. As a reminder, this strong cash flow result includes absorbing nearly 600 basis points impact of cash taxes. Adjusted for cash taxes, fiscal 2024 pretax cash flow was up 34%, representing 30% of revenue and up more than 200 basis points year-over-year.
As our free cash flow profile evolves, our capital allocation strategy also evolves. Our top priority continues to be investing in the business, both organically and through solution adjacency acquisitions to help drive sustainable, long-term growth. Even as we strategically invest, we are equally committed to driving increased free cash flow.
Given our strong profitability, cash flow and balance sheet, we also believe the time is right to add a share repurchase program as another strategic use of capital. As we announced today, our Board has authorized a $500 million share repurchase program, which we plan to utilize opportunistically based on market conditions. This program underscores our confidence in the business, our conviction in the significant long-term opportunities ahead and our commitment to driving exceptional shareholder value.
With that, let me turn to guidance. We are confident in the long-term growth opportunity for Dynatrace. The addressable market is large and growing. The observability and security ecosystem is expanding. The demand environment remains healthy. Our pipeline continues to grow faster than our ARR growth. Our platform and growing capabilities are highly differentiated, and our financial model is both balanced and durable.
Near term, we are mindful of the ongoing dynamic macro landscape. And while we've seen resiliency in the observability market, we believe it's appropriate to continue to assume a challenging macro climate in our guidance philosophy. Enterprises continue to be cautious in their spending, and our approach to guidance assumes that ongoing budget scrutiny and elongation of sales cycles will persist through fiscal 2025.
We also expect the growing trend of larger, more strategic deals related to observability architecture and vendor consolidation initiatives will continue. We are well positioned to capitalize on this trend. At the same time, these deals come with increased timing variability and longer duration to close. 
Lastly, as Rick outlined, we are enhancing and evolving our go-to-market strategy in fiscal 2025. These changes are all designed to drive deeper penetration and customer intimacy within our installed base and better capture and extend our leadership, especially with strategic enterprise and global account segments. With more than 30% of our accounts now transitioned to new sales reps, our guidance incorporates the potential for some near-term impact from these changes as they will take time to mature and begin positively impacting our sales performance. 
And with that as an opener, let's start with our guidance for the full year with growth rates in constant currency. We expect ARR to be between $1.720 billion and $1.735 billion, representing ARR growth of 15% to 16%. And while we don't guide to ARR on a quarterly basis, we expect the quarterly seasonality of net new ARR to be similar to fiscal 2024. We expect to provide an update on our full year ARR guidance on our fiscal Q2 earnings call when we have a better sense of our go-to-market traction.
Turning now to revenue. We expect total revenue for the full year to be $1.644 billion to $1.658 billion, up 16% to 17% year-over-year. Underlying that, subscription revenue is expected to be $1.571 billion and $1.585 billion, up 16% to 17%. Based on foreign exchange rates as of April 30, 2024, we expect a $10 million headwind to both ARR and revenue for fiscal year 2025. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be between $459 million and $467 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 28% for the year. This represents an anticipated 25 basis point improvement over fiscal 2024.
We plan to continue prioritizing investments in R&D, sales capacity, customer success and our partnership program while realizing additional leverage in other areas.  We expect non-GAAP net income to be $383 million to $392 million, resulting in a non-GAAP EPS of $1.26 to $1.29 per diluted share, based on roughly 303 million to 305 million shares outstanding.
Given the strength of our profitability on a GAAP basis, we fully utilized our remaining tax credit carryforwards in fiscal 2024. Further, given our R&D is primarily outside the U.S., we are significantly impacted by Internal Revenue Code Section 174, which requires a 15-year capitalization and amortization period for international R&D. As such, we expect an increase in our effective cash tax rate and related cash taxes in fiscal 2025.
Our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS calculations assume a non-GAAP effective cash tax rate of 22%, up from 17% in fiscal 2024. We expect the cash tax rate to stabilize in the low 20s going forward. With incremental cash taxes factored in, we expect free cash flow to be between $386 million to $398 million or 23.5% to 24% of revenue. The anticipated free cash flow impact from cash taxes is approximately $110 million or 7% of revenue, up from $81 million or 6% of revenue in fiscal 2024.
Excluding cash taxes, pretax free cash flow is expected to be between 30% and 30.5%, up 50 basis points from fiscal 2024 at the high end of the range. As a helpful reminder for your modeling, due to seasonality and variability in billings, we expect significantly higher free cash flow in the first and fourth quarters and significantly lower free cash flow in the second and third quarters.
Looking now at Q1, we expect total revenue to be between $391 million and $393 million or 18% to 19% growth. Subscription revenue is expected to be between $374 million and $376 million, up 19% year-over-year. From a profit standpoint, non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $105 million and $108 million or 27% to 27.5% of revenue. Lastly, non-GAAP EPS is expected to be approximately $0.29 to $0.30 per diluted share based on a share count of approximately 301 million to 302 million shares.
In summary, we are very pleased with our fourth quarter and fiscal 2024 performance. We are balancing conviction in our long-term opportunity with near-term prudence as we evolve our go-to-market to drive customer adoption and support our growing pipeline of large, competitive displacement opportunities. We have a strong track record of consistent execution. We are committed to maintaining a disciplined and balanced approach to optimizing costs, improving efficiency and profitability. At the same time, we will continue to invest in future growth opportunities that we expect will drive long-term value.
And with that, we will open the line for questions. Operator? [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley. Congrats on the Q4. I wanted to talk a little bit about some of these large deals that you landed in Q4, a 9-figure TCV deal and 8-figure land deal sort of reaffirms what you guys have been telling us the last couple of quarters that there's a lot of these larger [ deals ] in the pipeline, and it looks like you guys closed a healthy amount of them in Q4.
Rick, I was wondering what go-to-market changes that you have planned for the early part of the year in the context of the success you're seeing with these large enterprise deals. Should I take the go-to-market changes, meaning that you're trying to focus more down market and other customer segments? Or you just need more sort of sales capacity to close more volume of deals, given the success that you've seen landing in Q4? I'd love to just better understand the rationale for some of these go-to-market changes that you have planned for the first half. The short-form answer is that we're seeing increased momentum, increased traction, increased centralization of the end-to-end observability and broad-based observability architecture decisions. And the result of that is that's where you focus your sales energy. So in the go-to-market evolution, our focus on things like customer segmentation and partners really to address that end-to-end observability architecture approach is very consistent with what we're seeing in the market, and that's the -- what we're making headed into FY '25. The only other thing, I'd add to that is it's, Sanjit, it's actually providing more resource at the top of the pyramid. So if you think about the Global 500, the propensity for spend there is significantly higher than those customers that are below that. So we are weighting more resource at the higher end of the pyramid. So that's primarily what we're doing, and it's in line with what Rick outlined, which is more end-to-end observability decisions tend to occur with very large enterprise customers where our value proposition really thrives. Yes. It was great to see the validation of the thesis and 18 anchor deals closed in Q4 greater than $1 million, so 7-figure  ACV deals, a very, very strong performance. Yes, no, very impressive. As a follow-up, just in terms of what sort of -- under specific guidance, but certainly not you're assuming any sort of improvement in outlook, if you look at some of the things that can drive upside to your guidance, what would be some of the swing factors, if you will, that could get the ARR north of the 15% to 16% guidance? Yes, Sanjit, I'll take that. That's a good question that as we outlined kind of as a context for the guidance, we did suggest that, hey, we think the macro environment is not going to improve, it's not going to worsen. Customers are still leveraging observability as a priority.  We did outline that we do expect this trend of architecture for observability decisions to continue. And as we outlined around some of these go-to-market enhancements, what we're doing is, we're building in some prudence.
I mentioned in my prepared remarks that roughly 30% of our accounts are going to have a new rep. It's already taken place, so this is not like it's going to change throughout the year, but we changed accounts per rep. We know at times that can result in some near-term disruption. We've tried to factor that in. So to answer your question directly, to the extent we can minimize, that to the extent some of these larger deals, the timing of them occurs faster, I think those would be 2 factors that would drive improvement to this guidance. Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. One question for Rick and one for Jim. So Rick, clearly, the move upmarket is working, you're landing big deals, very strategic engagements, and that's great. But it does look like the net expansion rate on a trailing 12-month basis came down. So wondering if you could talk about the other side of the set, the mid-market business and what's happening there and what could happen there.
And one for you, Jim, looks like net new ARR, first of all, I got to tell you that you guys are one of the very few that disclose net new ARR, so thanks for the transparency. The year was down, but the quarter was up. Trend is getting better, right? If this trend holds, notwithstanding the changes to the field organization, what does that do to the guidance? Let me take the first one, Kash. So relative to the net new ARR and particular question around mid-market, the strategy around mid-market is really partners. We talk about that a lot. We are definitely leaned in relative to GSIs and hyperscalers. And that is really how we would expect to attack the mid-market space, which is through that avenue. Jim, on the second piece? Well, relative to the net new ARR, one of the things -- you are right that. If you look at the guide, this guide would suggest a slight moderation in net new ARR for the year for fiscal '25. As I mentioned to Sanjit, I think there are factors that could drive improvement to that. We actually felt that it was important to start with a guide that we thought reflected some prudence given some of the changes that we outlined.
I would tell you, as you know, just from a seasonality perspective, the other thing we included in the prepared remarks is you should expect the net new ARR, call it, seasonality to be similar to what it was in fiscal '24, which is lighter in the first half and heavier in the second half in Q1, in particular. Because it's the first quarter of the year, Q1 is seasonally our lightest quarter. So... And Jim, you went through that. That was crystal clear. Absolutely appreciate it. But Rick, on the mid-market, what's happening in the mid-market? So why couldn't net expansion rates be back to the 118%, 119% that they were versus the 111%. It looks like the swing factor is really mid-market because the large enterprise is doing really, really well. I appreciate your patience. Yes. I would say again that partners really are going to drive the mid-market for us, especially hyperscalers. If you get more granular cash, we would expect GSIs to be headed up market, if anything. You look at the 9-digit TCV Accenture deal with a large global financial institution, and that's the kind of thing that we're going to see out of GSIs. Hyperscaler engagements, we announced the partnership, go-to-market partnership with GCP in the past quarter as well. Those are the elements that will likely drive NRR in the mid-market. Our next question comes from the line of Koji Ikeda with Bank of America. A couple from me. I wanted to ask or go back to the record 18 7-figure deals. And I wanted to ask, how often was Grail a part of those big deals? And I was thinking about consolidation. Was a part of that logs on Grail replacing incumbent vendors? Yes, and yes, Grail is part of essentially every SaaS deal that we do at this point. So Grail, remember, is not equal to logs. Grail is underlying massively parallel processing data store for enormous amounts of data that can be accessed to store all sorts of different data types, logs, traces, metrics, et cetera. Logs access Grail, and logs are a key element of this end-to-end observability architecture approach.
What customers are finding is that the log element really should not be viewed as an independent data type or an independent avenue for things like root cause analysis. They instead want to incorporate all data types into one universal observability orientation. It drives better easier experience, it drives lower cost, it drives better outcomes. And so logs on Grail are very typically part of the Grail deployments. Got it. And maybe a follow-up for Jim here. In the past, you said that internally, the company thinks of the business as a rule-of-50 type business, 20% plus ARR growth with the remainder coming from pretax free cash flow. And so looking at the guide today, a bit shy of the target. I appreciate all the commentary on why the guidance is starting the way that it is.
But it does sound like when you're looking at the rule-of-50 type business profile, it's mostly falling short from the ARR growth side of the equation. And so how do you view the shape of ARR growth over the next, call it, 12 to 24 months to achieve that target? Or are you thinking about that target a bit differently now? No, it's a great question, Koji. We still do view very much internally this rule of 50. You're absolutely right, we've done a fantastic job driving leverage in the model with 30% pretax free cash flow margins. So the guide would suggest we're going to be a bit below that for fiscal '25. You can certainly imagine that we're driving the business to a better outcome on the top line. So that is certainly our ambition.
And the changes that we're making on the go-to-market side that Rick outlined, we know those changes may take a little while to kind of mature, but those are the changes that we believe will lead to acceleration in ARR growth. And so that will be the driver of getting us back to rule of 50. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. I wanted to direct my first question on the why. And what I mean by that is, if we take the feedback that we get from channels, it's pretty universally that Dynatrace has leading technology, particularly with the advent of Grail. And yet if I look at the trend from '22, '23, '24 and what you're guiding to for '25, there's a steady erosion of growth, particularly if I focus on net new. And while I appreciate you've made some comments on there's some changes to go-to-market and whatnot, this has been an ongoing trend.
And I'm just trying to maybe tease out the why a little bit more about the deceleration, particularly in light of, if I superimpose our views of what security and logs are doing, it suggests the legacy or core, if you will, is having a more meaningful deceleration. And I'm just trying to understand why because the elongation of deal cycles, you would think that, that anniversaries at some point in time. So it's hard to reconcile that with the amount of deceleration that you're demonstrating.
And is it because the underlying market of APM is slowing down? Or is it the fact that you guys are focused on the largest customers, so perhaps spend is tighter there? Just really trying to understand not just what this quarter is, which was an excellent quarter, but really, what's the trend over the last couple of years, and why is there such a significant slowdown and deceleration? Because it doesn't seem that go-to-market fully explains it. Well, I can start with that and Rick, you can offer. So one, I'd remind you that the time frame that you're talking about is a time frame where the macro environment worsened materially. So a moderation in growth rates, look at anyone in the software sector, that generally has affected all software companies. So that is not unique to Dynatrace.
So I would say the growth moderation is not an anomaly. I would concur that this guide specifically for fiscal '25 is prudent. I think we are building changes for the company for the long term. We've not abandoned the land-and-expand model at all. So that's still a predominant motion. But we do believe in order to get the penetration and growth that we need, an adjustment to the go-to-market model was needed. We needed to get more weighting of resources to higher propensity to spend customers.
And these customers are the customers that -- our offering is a sweet spot for them. Our value proposition is really oriented to very enterprise-oriented complex environment companies. Ensuring we had the right focus there is what we needed to adjust. That is largely the driver. So these changes that we're making, we think, are focusing on the right profile of customers for the value proposition that we provide and that once we navigate through this, will lead to a reacceleration. Yes. Keith, I would simply add that we've gone through a platform transition really to Grail, number one. Number two, we've gone through go-to-market transition. So there have been a couple of transitions amidst this macro environment that Jim described as well. And as we think about these trends towards end-to-end observability architecture decisions that play to our favor, combined with the strength of Grail, the strength of the platform underlying it, along with these go-to-market changes to take advantage of this market trend, we're very optimistic as we look to the future. Okay, okay. Terrific. And Jim, maybe I'll just direct my follow-on question, which relates to that. You indicated that the $100 million targets that you had previously anticipated for '25 are pushing into '26. Was that for both security and for logs? And what -- which -- in past conversations, I think you had some more optimism, if you will, around logs. But maybe you could just tease out a little bit why those are being pushed out. And did I hear you correctly that that's -- sort of both are pushing into '26? You did. So I'll start with, we're making very good traction with both of those. So both areas, we have 600-plus customers leveraging either our application security solution and 600 on the log side. So we're getting good traction.
I would say on the adoption side, I've always said on logs in particular, that the adoption would take a while and that there would be a requirement for an uptick in the back half of fiscal '25. Again, we still have confidence, and so the market is still good for those offerings. I think our competitive differentiation is still compelling. But I think they will be $100 million-plus businesses. We just wanted to be open that we think that, that might extend.
And the reason is, as we see a growing trend of these end-to-end observability decisions from customers, what we have found and it's still early days is they sequence what they deploy. And when they sequence what they deploy, sometimes they're deploying application observability, infrastructure monitoring, things of that nature first and logs and application security are like on their road map, but those are, call it, those are following.
And so the adoption of those areas, we believe, are probably going to push a little bit. So we think these businesses will still be $100 million-plus businesses. We do think this trend of what we're seeing with platform consolidation will change the sequencing and adoption of some of these new emerging areas. Yes. I would also just add that increase in number of log customers to 600, which is up 30% quarter-over-quarter increase -- a similar increase in the number of AppSec customers. So we continue to see traction and continue to see deployment in these core areas with substantial growth in consumption. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. As we -- as you guys kind of pursue these larger deals, obviously, there's only like a few -- can you talk a little bit about like the changes in the vendor landscape that you're kind of dealing with them? Is that like a consolidation of tools? Are you replacing things?
And then on the replacement side, there's obviously just then just one big one that comes to mind, but that kind of seem to have locked in a lot of their customers on kind of renewals. Can you talk a little bit about the timing that we could see here in terms of like getting some and then kind of the building momentum on the larger deal side? Raimo, the landscape is evolving, as I mentioned earlier, really towards an increased view towards centralization of the overall landscape and decisions associated with observability. What we saw, for example, in the large airline example that we provided in our prepared remarks was they felt they were spending too much money to get too little user experience and too many incidents.
By consolidating multiple different vendors together, they felt they would improve user experience, reduce cost and dramatically reduce the number of incidents. And this is the trend that we're seeing. And there are, frankly, just very few vendors in the space that can provide this solution to that landscape orientation, and Dynatrace is core among them. Yes. Okay. Perfect. And then the -- for Jim, like in the previous quarters, you talked a little bit about the needs for investments, et cetera. And you were one of the first to point out that I need to pre-invest into sales capacity, et cetera. If I look at the guidance and the numbers now, it actually looks like you're kind of managing to kind of -- still show us good profitability levels and still seem to invest well. Can you talk a little bit about some of the initiatives you're doing there to achieve that? You're right, Raimo, that one of the things you've always gotten with Dynatrace is a commitment to continue to try to drive -- leverage and drive balance as evidenced by what is almost 300 basis points of operating margin expansion this year, 200 basis points of free cash flow.
We're going to -- we are continuing to drive scale across the business. So if you saw leverage in G&A, you should expect to see more leverage in G&A. There's things we're doing around cloud hosting costs, where potentially we can drive some modest leverage in gross margin. So I would say, it's multiple and it's, call it, modest in areas but it adds up. The areas that we are making very specific investments are we are making very specific investments in R&D. We expect R&D to actually as a percent of revenue to grow in fiscal '25.
We do think on the sales and marketing side, we will see a little bit of leverage. Some of that leverage will come from, to Rick's opening point about partners and driving more through partners. But I do want to make it clear, we are also going to make incremental sales rep investments in fiscal '25. So there will be investments in sales capacity in addition to kind of getting better partner leverage and productivity. So it's a bunch of different areas. And what we're committed to is to stabilize and/or expand margins for the business. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. It's Dan Bergstrom for Matt Hedberg. So on the partner side, sounds again like great contribution for partners on those large 7-figure deals. You talked to some whitespace around new logos for partners in the prepared remarks. Just wondering what maybe can you do to help the origination side of the equation for partners. Well, the whole purpose of driving partners is really for that origination. We already have a very substantial percentage of partner influence deals. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, over 2/3 of deals are already partner influenced, so we are deeply engaged with the partner community already. The real thrust around our partner initiatives is to drive that 30% origination higher which is precisely what we're doing with the GSIs and the hyperscalers. So that is the major thrust of our partner strategy. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. I know you mentioned that the changes in the sales force changing out 30% of your logos. I guess, have you done this in the past? And what have you seen? And effectively, what are you trying to achieve? It seems like a pretty big change in the go-to-market. So I'm just curious if you could double click on what you expect to achieve through this. Yes. So I'll take that. So every year, there is some modest level of account movement. So that's, call it, not unique. I'd say it is -- what is unique is having 30% of your accounts now kind of move to a new rep. But just to be clear, again, one of the things that we're doing is the sweet spot for Dynatrace is in very large enterprise environments. And when we looked at the resource coverage that we had in the Global 500, we felt we needed to weight more investment there. We needed more sales capacity there, that the number of accounts per rep and that part of the kind of coverage pyramid was not the density that we wanted. So we are making more investments. Some of that investment is just reallocating investments from, call it, the mid commercial to the strategic global accounts.
Obviously, the whole point of this is those customers have a greater propensity to spend. The more we can do to get better coverage with them, the more -- I would say, the more intimacy and the more penetration we can get for their spend. And so the whole point of it is to drive more dedication of observability spend to Dynatrace with those customers and also garner some new logos in that space that we don't have today. So that's really the focus.
And then to Rick's point, it's also leveraging partners kind of in the broader ecosystem. And certainly, at the bottom end of the pyramid, it's an inside sales motion, which we've had in the past. But adding more capacity there with an inside sales motion. But all of these changes are designed to drive better productivity and to drive an acceleration in bookings and ultimately, ARR growth. Okay. And I think maybe just tying back to the guide, these actions are accounting for the deceleration you're seeing despite all the hyperscalers seen accelerating growth and growth that's anywhere between high teens to 40% plus. Yes. I would say what we're doing is we're trying to build some prudence that when you make go-to-market changes like this, we're mindful that sometimes these changes can cause reps to pause. You have reps that are learning new accounts, reps that are building relationships, things of that nature and that we are trying to build in some prudence that there may be some near-term impact from this account movement. As I said, I think it was, to Sanjit, what could allow us to do better is if we -- as we transition through this, if this disruption that we're modeling doesn't occur, then we could deliver a better outcome. And that's certainly what we're striving to do. Our final question this morning comes from the line of Fatima Boolani with Citi. Just, Jim, for you, I wanted to unpack the dollar-based net retention rate performance in the quarter. I know macros haven't necessarily gotten worse, but I was hoping you could speak to some of the puts and takes on that hitting 111% or a 2-point sequential deceleration in the quarter. And if you can paint a pathway for us as to the time and slope of a re-expansion in this metric, especially when I superimpose some of your commentary around how successful the consumption trends under the DPS selling vehicle are going.
So I was hoping you could bridge the gap for us in terms of some of the lightness and the compression this quarter and how we can get back to a path towards your historical 120% levels, and a quick follow-up, please. Right. So I'd say, you're right that the NRR was -- was just -- it was, I'd say, it rounded down from 112% to 111%. So a little bit lighter, but I think that's largely driven by the fact that we had a very, very strong new logo quarter. And so sometimes you have quarters where new logos are stronger than expansions. We had a very good new logo quarter.
You did highlight some important things to make sure we comment on, is DPS as a vehicle, it's still early days, making good traction, 18% of our customers, now call it, 30-plus percent of our ARR. The fact that these customers are consuming faster is a -- think of it as a leading indicator. It is a leading indicator that if they consume faster, it means they're getting more value out of the platform. It means they're consuming at a faster rate, which means that is a leading indicator of a future expansion.
We're relatively early days with DPS. So you think of the cohorts that we have that we've only been at it for a year. And so it will take a little bit of time for this to manifest itself in expansion and in NRR, but that is the expectation. And the leading indicator we're seeing is DPS as a contracting vehicle is doing exactly what we thought, which is allows customers to access the platform without committing SKU-based items, that they are dollar-based commitment, they're leveraging as much of the platform. They have an ability to leverage all the product capabilities. The fact that they're consuming at a rapid rate means that we believe that you will see an earlier expansion that otherwise would have occurred under a SKU-based model.
I think we will see some of that in fiscal '25. But I think exiting fiscal '25 is really, you'll see even more of that. I appreciate that. And just on the point of new logo and new logo growth. I know historically, you've talked about an algorithm between acquiring new logos and going down the expansion path with your very loyal and very large customers who have that propensity to spend. But I'm curious if you can please comment on how you're thinking about the new logo trajectory in fiscal '25 in the context of rebalancing some of your sales capacity resources and straddling the quality versus the quantity dynamic of a new logo acquisition. It's a great question. I would say the model hasn't fundamentally changed as far as, that I'd say today, of our ARR, 40% of our ARR roughly comes from new logos, 60% from expansion. That's not going to change fundamentally. Your comment about quantity versus quality of -- we are very focused on the quality. I'm not as focused on the quantity. What we have found is that if we land customers at greater than $100,000 of ARR, they expand much faster.
Obviously, what you've seen is this growing trend of architecture decisions, you're going to have some quarters like we had in the fourth quarter where you're overweighted in that area, and they're very, very, very large. So I'd say we're focused more on the quality of the land. Some of these go-to-market changes that we've outlined, I think are, again, geared towards more quantity, a little bit in the mid-market, but I'd say it's primarily quality. And so the, call it, the equation we think about, let's call it, roughly 40% of the ARR coming from new -- 60% from expansion. And I think that's probably going to continue. All right. Well, thank you all for your questions and ongoing support. We saw Q4 as a very strong finish to fiscal 2024 and establishing momentum as we head into the new fiscal year. We are quite bullish about the opportunity or end-to-end observability decisions to come.
We look forward to connecting with you at upcoming IR events over the coming weeks, and we wish you all a very good day. Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.","Dynatrace's fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2024 Earnings call is being recorded . the call represents the company's views on May 15, 2024 . we assume no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information .",1.0

[Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Noelle Faris, the Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin. Good morning, and thank you for joining Dynatrace's First Quarter Fiscal 2025 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Rick McConnell, Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Benson, Chief Financial Officer.
Before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements such as statements regarding revenue, earnings guidance and economic conditions. Actual results may differ materially from our expectations due to a number of risks and uncertainties discussed in Dynatrace's SEC filings, including our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q that we filed earlier today. The forward-looking statements contained in this call represent the company's views on August 7, 2024. We assume no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information, future events or circumstances. Unless otherwise noted, the growth rates we discuss today are non-GAAP, reflecting constant currency growth and per share amounts are on a diluted basis. We will also discuss other non-GAAP financial measures on today's call. To see reconciliations between non-GAAP and GAAP measures, please refer to today's earnings press release and supplemental presentation, which are both posted in the Financial Results section of our IR website. And with that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Rick McConnell. Thanks, Noel, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for today's call. Our first quarter results are a compelling example of our team's disciplined execution and dedicated focus on delivering exceptional customer value. ARR grew 20% year-over-year in constant currency. Subscription revenue increased 21% year-over-year in constant currency. And free cash flow was 30% of revenue on a trailing 12-month basis.
These results continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver a powerful combination of top line growth and profitability. Now more than ever, given recent industry-wide outages that have impacted billions of end users globally, observability software has become mandatory in helping organizations minimize impact.
The strength of our end-to-end observability platform resonates with our customers as they look to maximize software availability and deliver mission-critical business resilience. Jim will share more details about our Q1 performance in a moment. In the meantime, I'd like to share my thoughts on the evolution of the market and why I believe we are well positioned to win.
To start, the observability market is large and growing, fueled by the tailwinds of cloud migration and the promise of AI. The TAM of the observability and application security market is estimated to be $50 billion and growing and IDC expects businesses to spend more than $0.5 trillion on AI over the next 3 years. CIOs continue to prioritize IT budgets toward digital transformation efforts as organizations seek new ways to build competitive advantage.
But as they drive cloud modernization and generative AI initiatives, organizations often confront significant challenges. These efforts create an explosion of data and massive increase in complexity, often resulting in a lack of proper visibility into application performance problems, user experience issues and cybersecurity threats. Observability solutions are needed to provide the required visibility to manage cloud environments effectively.
Moreover, we continue to see customers looking to consolidate siloed monitoring tools and standardize on an end-to-end observability platform. The advantages of such an approach typically include increased productivity, reduced costs, improve security and a more consistent user experience.
I often get asked, why does Dynatrace win? And my response is twofold. First is the power of our end-to-end platform. And second is our relentless commitment to delivering extraordinary customer value. Regarding our platform, customers frequently choose Dynatrace for delivering a combination of contextual analytics, AI leadership and data-driven automation.
We uniquely leverage a fully integrated data store, we call GRA, that captures all observability data types in context, allowing for powerful analytics in near real time. We then apply our power of 3 approach to AI, leveraging predictive causal and generative AI techniques to provide precise answers enabling not only rapid incident correction, but also predictive action and automated response.
At the same time, these differentiators facilitate not only successful digital transformation, but they also help our customers drive better business outcomes such as increased revenue, improved cost efficiencies and higher productivity. We are driven by a continuous focus on innovation. Last quarter, for example, we extended our platform with the launch of Site Reliability Guardian, Davis anomaly detection and the vulnerabilities app, and we expanded our existing security capabilities with the addition of Kubernetes security posture management.
Over the coming months, there is much more to come. Our financial strength affords us the flexibility to invest purposefully in ongoing R&D to strengthen these capabilities and maintain our leadership position. With respect to value delivery, we win because of our proven commitment to customer success with tangible ROI.
The recent worldwide outages are a stark reminder of the world's reliance on software and how critical it is that software works as intended. Our vision has been unwavering over the years in enabling a world where software works perfectly, just as we all expect. These major outages further highlight the criticality of deploying an end-to-end observability platform that helps customers achieve substantially greater business resiliency.
Customers leveraging our platform during these incidents, we're able to quickly identify where issues arose in their ecosystem and prioritize remediation to those areas with the greatest business impact. More data is not the solution. The critical need is the ability to pinpoint root cause, identify and prioritize actions and remediate rapidly.
Manual processes do not scale. Our AI capabilities provide the critical information needed to deliver this value, and they set us apart from our competitors. Many customers reached out following the CrowdStrike outage to thank us with the insights we provided that help them quickly prioritize the recovery work needed to stabilize their environments.
A U.S.-based health care company told us that Dynatrace was an integral part of their overall recovery process. Leveraging Grail and notebook features, they were able to identify potential issues within their infrastructure stack, enabling them to provide high availability and a positive outcome. A major U.S. airline leveraged log on rail as well as the Dynatrace query language to identify which airport kiosks were affected, enabling the team to focus their recovery efforts and get their customers back in the air quickly.
An insurance provider was impacted indirectly through its third-party ticketing system. Davis AI determined the root cause on the vendor side, hours before the third party announced that they were impacted. This advanced warning allowed the provider to execute a contingency plan much earlier than if they had waited for the third party to notify them of the problem.
And the IT Directors at one of the world's largest biotech companies set Dynatrace was a key piece of the recovery effort of their most critical systems. This customer had over 3,500 hosts initially unavailable. With Dynatrace, they were able to recover all of those hosts in less than 12 hours.
This leads to the next question, which is given the strength of our platform and our commitment to innovation and customer success, what are we doing to ensure that we have the optimal go-to-market strategy to capture this opportunity? Last quarter, I provided an update on go-to-market changes, including 3 focal areas. While still earlier in the year, we are pleased with our progress along with the leadership team driving.
First is customer segmentation. We continue to target the Global 15,000 overall. But at the beginning of our fiscal year, we increased the focus of our sales force on the Global 500 in strategic enterprise accounts to drive the highest productivity with the accounts that have the largest potential ARR.
Territory and account leverage changes were completed in April, and we are executing accordingly. We also increased investment in customer success to outline these resources to our segmentation mapping for successful deployment, adoption and expansion. Second, we continue to emphasize the criticality of partners.
Partners already influenced more than 2/3 of our ARR, but we believe we can scale them to deliver far more deal origination than they do today. We are especially focused on our highest priority and most impactful partners, including GSIs and hyperscalers, and we are making strategic investments to make it easier to go to market with us across all partners.
These investments include an expanded partner enablement engine as well as a simplified economic model to remove friction and drive closer collaboration. Finally, in our go-to-market strategy, we have aligned around a focused set of use cases. Traditionally, we have had tremendous success with our land and expand sales motion where we lead with application performance engagements and expand across our customers' workloads. This is an extremely effective approach and one we continue to rely on today.
At the same time, the market is evolving. And we have broadened our approach to include end-to-end observability opportunities for customers looking to reduce tools sprawl as well as gain actionable insights. This enables organizations to resolve incidents faster if not prevent them from happening in the first case. And we are targeting cloud modernization efforts in which platform engineers and DevOps teams are increasingly responsible for how their organization's development and release of software requires complete visibility of data at scale.
Before I turn the call over to Jim, I wanted to take a moment to recognize an important milestone for Dynatrace. Last week marked the 5-year anniversary of our IPO. Over the past 5 years, we have achieved several important milestones. We have empowered over 4,000 organizations in their digital transformation initiatives. We are 1 of only 8% of public software companies that have exceeded $1 billion in revenue, generating cumulative revenue of now more than $5 billion, along with cumulative free cash flow of more than $1 billion.
I am truly proud of our team and the successes that we have collectively achieved today on behalf of our customers partners, shareholders and Dynatracers worldwide. In closing, we are off to a great start to the year, and I'm highly enthusiastic about the balance of FY '25 and beyond. We really do believe that our time is now.
We believe the market is increasingly playing to our strengths in moving toward fewer solutions with a need for actionable insights leading to rapid incident resolution and prevention. And we believe the strength of our AI-powered end-to-end observability platform makes all the difference. Jim, over to you. Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Q1 was indeed a strong start to fiscal 2025. Once again, we surpassed the high end of our top line growth and profitability guidance metrics. Our continued ability to successfully execute in this dynamic macro environment is a testament to the growing criticality of observability and application security in the market, our product and platform differentiation, the value proposition we provide to customers and the ongoing durability of our business model that continues to deliver a balance of strong growth and profitability.
Now let's review the first quarter results in more detail. Please note the growth rates mentioned will be year-over-year and in constant currency, unless otherwise stated. Annual recurring revenue, or ARR, was $1.54 billion, up 20% year-over-year. This is an increase of $247 million compared to the same period last year.
Q1 net new ARR on a constant currency basis was $46 million, up 23% year-over-year. In Q1, we added 162 new logos to the Dynatrace platform, up 5% from the year ago quarter. We continue to target quality new logos that have a greater propensity to expand. In Q1, average ARR per new logo came in at roughly $140,000 on a trailing 12-month basis and consistent with Q4.
Our value proposition continues to resonate with enterprise customers that are outgrowing their existing DIY or commercial tooling solutions. They are seeking business value and tool consolidation and coming to Dynatrace for the depth, breadth and automation of our end-to-end observability platform.
Once customers experience the benefits of the Dynatrace platform, they are quick to expand their usage. Our average ARR per customer continues to increase and is approaching full $100,000, highlighting the mission-critical value we provide to customers. Churn continues to be low, with gross retention rates stable in the mid-90s, best-in-class in our industry, while net retention rate came in at 112% in the first quarter, a slight improvement from Q4.
Our DPS licensing model continues to see strong traction. We closed roughly 200 DPS deals globally in Q1, bringing total DPS customers to over 900 representing more than 20% of our customer base and over 40% of our ARR. As we have shared in the past, we believe our simplified cross-platform DPS licensing model will further contribute to NRR over time as customers can immediately access newer solutions, encounter less friction in the buying process and enjoy more flexible, predictable and transparent pricing.
All of which should lead to more consumption of capabilities on the platform and deliver more business value to customers. One example of DPS leading to broader platform adoption is with a Fortune 500 international hotel brand. The flexibility of DPS licensing provided them with the opportunity to trial logs on GRAIL and compare it to their existing legacy log management solutions.
The value provided by our log analytics resulted in a 7-figure DPS expansion deal in Q1, displacing the incumbent log monitoring provider. Moving on to revenue. Total revenue for the first quarter was $399 million and subscription revenue for the quarter was $382 million, both up 21% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance by $6 million.
Shifting to margins. Non-GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was 85%, up slightly from the prior quarter and prior year. Non-GAAP income from operations for the first quarter was $114 million, $6 million above the high end of our guidance range, driven by the top line upside. This resulted in a non-GAAP operating margin of 29%, exceeding the top end of the guidance range by roughly 100 basis points.
Non-GAAP net income was $99 million, or $0.33 per diluted share. This was $0.03 above the high end of our guidance range, primarily driven by the revenue upside and higher interest income. We generated $227 million of free cash flow in the first quarter, representing more than 50% of our full year guidance.
Q1 cash flow was particularly robust from strong collections associated with elevated Q4 renewal and growth bookings. Due to seasonality and variability in billings quarter-to-quarter, we believe it is best to view free cash flow over a trailing 12-month period.
On a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow was $450 million or 30% of revenue. As a reminder, this includes 600 basis points of impact related to cash taxes. Pretax free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was 36% of revenue and up 55% year-over-year.
Finally, a brief update on our $500 million share repurchase program. In Q1, we repurchased roughly 1.1 million shares for approximately $50 million. We plan to continue to buy back shares opportunistically based on market conditions, underscoring our confidence in the business, our conviction in the significant long-term opportunities ahead and commitment to delivering shareholder value.
Moving now to guidance. The demand environment and pipeline remain healthy. Our end-to-end platform and broad set of capabilities differentiate us and put us in a strong competitive position. Our teams continue to execute well. However, as we shared on our last earnings call, we are taking a prudent approach to guidance due to 3 factors: first, the dynamic macro environment and current market choppiness; second, the growing trend of a larger observability architecture and vendor consolidation deals come with an increased level of timing variability; and third, the evolution of our go-to-market strategy will take time to settle in and mature.
On our last earnings call in May, we indicated that we would update our full year ARR guidance on our second quarter earnings call in November. That remains our current plan. We believe this prudent approach makes sense through the historical seasonality of our business, where typically less than 20% of net new ARR is booked in the first quarter and 60% is booked in the second half of the fiscal year.
Waiting until the Q2 earnings call gives us time to have a better sense of the traction we are getting with the go-to-market changes we discussed last quarter and assess any potential impact on IT spending from recent economic uncertainty. As such, we are maintaining our full year fiscal '25 guidance for ARR, revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, EPS and free cash flow.
There are a few underlying elements of color I'd like to share for modeling purposes. On the seasonality of ARR, we continue to expect roughly 40% of net new ARR to land in the first half of fiscal 2025 and roughly 60% to land in the back half. Based on foreign exchange rates as of July 31, we expect the full year foreign exchange headwind to be roughly $12 million on ARR and approximately $10 million on revenue, representing an incremental headwind of approximately $2 million to ARR and no change to revenue compared to our prior guidance.
And for free cash flow, as we shared on our May earnings call, we expect significantly lower free cash flow in the second and third quarters and lower than prior year levels due to expected seasonality in billings and the timing of cash tax payments. We are, however, maintaining our full year guidance for free cash flow.
Looking at Q2, we expect total revenue to be between $404 million and $407 million. Subscription revenue is expected to be between $388 million to $390 million. From a profit standpoint, non-GAAP income from operations is expected to be $113 million to $116 million or 28% to 28.5% of revenue.
Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.32 to $0.33 per diluted share. In summary, we are pleased with our first quarter fiscal 2025 performance. We have a proven track record of consistent execution. While we are taking a prudent approach to the near-term outlook, we remain optimistic about the fiscal '25 growth opportunity in front of us and our ongoing ability to manage the business with discipline. And with that, we will open the line for questions. Operator? [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Patrick Colville with Scotia Bank. Congrats on a really good set of results. I guess I want to ask about the contrary at the top of the call, Rene about the CrowdStrike incident, very helpful color you provided as to kind of how Dynatrace was critical for your customers in remediating that major issue. But investors on the line, I'm sure will be thinking will this possibly drive incremental business? And if so, would you mind kind of talking about the levers there? Thanks, Patrick. It's Rick. I'll take that. The short form is, I mean, it's premature to attribute any future ARR growth to CrowdStrike and the incident. But what I would say is the feedback from customers was overwhelmingly positive. It's clear that we wouldn't have helped avoid the incident for customers given the nature of this particular incident. But we absolutely did materially accelerate getting customers back online rapidly by enabling them to prioritize their software workloads and what needed to be brought up most rapidly. And this was very consistent feedback across the board, which is why I wanted to share it in our prepared remarks. Last point on this, I would say, is simply that these outages are just further evidence of the mission criticality of and observability software.
In cases where it took customers, even customers are more longer to get on board, or back up to speed and running with their software workloads, what we typically found was that they weren't using us end to end. And so some of the workloads were not captured in their analytics. And when we did have customers that were looking at observant end-to-end across a complete data flow, that's where we saw the best results. Our next question comes from the line of Pinjalim Bora with JPMorgan. Great. Jim, one question for you. the 112% NRR seems to suggest that maybe the in-quarter retention rate likely improved quite a bit sequentially. So wondering if you can talk about the drivers of that. Have you seen any change in the pace of new workloads or kind of pace of adoption of some of the newer modules? Is the inclusion of the DPS customers added a year ago helping that metric? Any color would be great. Sure. It's a good question, Pinjalim. I'd start with it was a modest improvement from Q4. So we're pleased with 112. But to be very frank, it's effectively going from kind of 111 and change to kind of something that rounds up to 112. So while we're pleased I don't want to suggest that we think this means that we're going to now start to see NRR improve in future quarters. And obviously, our guide does not suggest that. Having said that, we had a very strong expansion quarter. And one of the things we talked about in the prepared remarks is we continue to get customers and see customer interest in our DPS contracting vehicle, which now represents over 40% of our ARR. And those customers are consuming more of the platform at a much more significant rate than non-EPS customers. So we're starting to see it manifest itself in consumption. And if the consumption trends for growth continue, we should be able to see, one, a stabilization in NRR. And then hopefully, if the thesis proves out, we will start to see an acceleration in NRI. So I'd say early days, we're pleased with the Q1 performance. It wasn't any particular module. I did specifically talk about logs as being kind of one case with a large hotel chain and I think it's just a great example. The reason I shared it is it's a great example of customers when they're on DPS. They can try something. In that case, they tried our log solution and it ultimately landed a very, very significant expansion. And so I'd say it's effectively across the board, but we are starting to see interest in the newer solutions and customers starting to expand even further. Our next question comes from the line of Will Power with Baird. Congratulations on the results. Jim, I just want to circle back on full year guidance just in light of the nice Q1 upside, Q2 guidance looks good. And it sounds like it's principally probably prudence given early in the year and you've had some of the sales changes. But I just wonder if you could comment on anything you're seeing in terms of changes you're seeing with respect to macro, large deal timing. I mean some of that. I think you've already started to bake in. So questions on timing and macro impacts. Have there been any changes over the last 3 months, I guess, since you last reported with respect to some of those trends that might be impacting guidance? Thanks for the question, Will. And actually, it's a good question. Nothing has changed from 3 months ago. What we had shared 3 months ago was we said, hey, the first quarter is less than 20% of our year from a net new ARR. That's certainly the driver of our business across all of our metrics. We said, secondly, hey, the market from a macro perspective, certainly, we don't believe it's worsened, but we certainly didn't expect that it was going to change. And that means customers have multiple levels of approval. None of that has changed, hasn't gotten worse, hasn't gotten better. I'd say the other thing we talked about is that we are seeing a growing theme of customers considering tool consolidation initiatives. And when that happens, these deal cycles take a little bit longer. Nothing has changed in that regard either. And then lastly, we talked about the go-to-market changes. And Rick outlined it in his prepared remarks, the good news is you've seen no disruption. We actually had a very solid start to the year. So the go-to-market changes are settling in. And we're just trying to be measured given that it's early in the year we felt that it made more sense to see another quarter of traction on the go-to-market side. We'll have certainly much better visibility to the back half of the year. So I wouldn't read anything into the guide being maintained other than building in just a continued level of kind of prudence and that we will update you on the November call with what we're seeing at that time. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC. Great. And I'll offer my congrats again team. I guess for either of you, just double-clicking on the go-to-market changes. I guess, have you been able to hire and I guess, internally promote all the sales executives you've intended to better target the Global 500. And I guess -- how do you think about the risk to close rates as the year progresses for some of those accounts that may have been reassigned as a result of the go-to-market changes. Do I take that? Go. So I would say the changes that we made are complete. So we've effectively assigned all the accounts. So while we'll continue to do hiring of sales reps, I'd say the hiring is going to happen more substantively in the back half of the year. So I think we're in a good place as far as the account settling in with reps. And just to remind you, I think we talked about it last quarter. But even though there's been a reassignment of reps and in particular, on the very large, call it, strategic IT 500 accounts. In most cases, those were not accounts that we had significant either traction in from an ARR perspective or significant pipeline in. So from our perspective, there wasn't a huge risk in moving some of these accounts from reps we had talked about those accounts or those that kind of customer segmentation had 8 to 10 accounts. Now they have 4 to 5 accounts. So the accounts that moved were accounts that have a significant propensity to spend, but they were not accounts that we had huge traction in. So we're not worried about there being disruption of accounts moving from one rep to the other. We're actually encouraged that we now have an ability for new reps to spend more time with those accounts, go deeper with those accounts. And given the sales cycles are kind of 6 to 9 months, our expectation is you'll see that manifest itself in traction in the back half of the year. I would just add, Matt, that very, very excited about our sales and marketing leadership teams. They are ready for prime time and ready to take the company to the next level of scale. So that's exciting. And to Jim's point, on risk. I think that's very much manageable based upon the parameters that we set forth as part of the go-to-market changes. Our next question comes from the line of Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley. Congrats on another quarter of positive net AR growth. I wanted to come back to sort of the DPS update that you guys provided, now accounting for 40% of revenue. Is there any sort of pattern in terms of the capabilities that customers are turning on upon moving to DPS? I imagine Lagunillas are pretty popular. But we need interested to see if there's any other sort of capabilities or modules that are becoming more popular. And sort of in addition to that, from a sales perspective, are you as the team sort of being opinionated on how customers sort of turn on capabilities? Is there a sales motion or a playbook that you guys prefer that customers go down? Or you sort of just leave that up to the customer? I'll take that. That's 2 good questions. So on the DPS traction, we're very pleased with where we're at. It's becoming more and more the norm for customers to move to that, in particular, new logos, call it, roughly 70% of our new logos continue to land on DPS, and we continue to get existing customers moving. Relative to modules, it does vary. But I would say that there's been significant interest in logs, and there's been significant interest in application security. Obviously, they're looking at their full stack of workloads, and they're trying to assess where do they want to move relative to observability. So certainly, there's a fair amount of that, that they probably look at that first and foremost, what's the growth that we want to see with existing workloads, new workloads. And then, oh, by the way, what new capabilities might we want to take advantage of. So every customer varies a bit based on the pain point that they're currently dealing with. But I'd say certainly significant interest in logs in particular and also application security. And relative to the go-to-market playbook, one of the things we talked about last quarter, it's not unique to DPS necessarily, although DPS does benefit is that we've become much more precise in the playbook. The playbook before was largely a land-and-expand model with applications. So you try to find an application owner, you'd land for application observability after a POC and you'd expand from there. That the sales leadership is now defined 3 plays, that being one, which is still a very effective play. The other is a player on end-to-end observability because we started to see more traction in that area, more interested in that area. So there are plays that we're running on end-to-end observability. And then there's plays that we're running on cloud modernization looking at new personas in customers' environments that maybe you're not leveraging Dynatrace, we tend to be heavy in the IT ops area and maybe getting more into the developer persona. So there is very precise plays. Those plays do play the strength a bit of DPS. You get customers on a DPS contract vehicle, and they have a significant flexibility to leverage what they want, trial what they want. And so we're very pleased with the traction we're getting in that area. And actually, we're very pleased with what I would say is a growing level of sophistication in the way sales is going to market. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Congrats from me as well. Rick or maybe Jim as well. The question for me is around the partner ecosystem. You talked about how partners are a lot more involved on, I think it's 2/3 of the ARR. If you think about the the partner evolution in terms of how they're dealing with you and what they want to do with you. Is that still on a kind of APM infrastructure, et cetera? Or do you see the partners also positioning themselves more broad into that whole optimality space and hence, it becomes more of a strategic decision that they can drive towards you? Raimo, I'll take that. I would say that it depends on the partner. The -- if you're looking at hyperscalers, that tends to be more opportunistic, contract vehicle with some origination built in. If you're looking at GSIs, they're looking at end-to-end observability deals, typically larger transactions. And they're focused on services, deployment, process reengineering, cloud migration, cloud-native movement and other elements. And then we have various partners in between ranging from managed services providers to others. So it depends on the partners, but I would say that generally, you heard a theme in our call this morning around end-to-end observability. This is where we believe that we deliver the most value to customers, and this is where we're promoting the most partner access because the services loads and the services increment that they can provide is material in helping organizations structure for success around end-to-end observability deployments. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Cikos with Needham & Company. And I just want to continue that theme on the partners here following Raimo's question, but a bit of a 2-parter. The first, can you help us think about, have we seen any noticeable changes since you guys have changed or overhauled the partner economic model as far as deals originating with partners at this point? Or is there still we're still hanging out around 30% or so. And then the second point is in relation to that changed partner economic model, are you seeing an acceleration potentially in the number of partners that are now entering the Dynatrace ecosystem? Any color on either of those items would be beneficial? I'll take that, Mike. So I will say on the partner economic model side that we only put that in place at the beginning of our fiscal year. So we're kind of 90 days in. As you can imagine, you probably had a bunch of deals that were already in flight. So I'd probably -- it's probably be insincere to say that we're getting significant traction because of the partner economic model. I would say qualitatively customers are very happy with the change in the economic model. It provides much more certainty for them around how and what they're going to get paid. So in that regard, qualitatively, there is significant customer partner satisfaction with the changes we've made. We did see an uptick in deal origination above the 30% level that we've historically had in the quarter. It is our seasonally lightest quarter of the year. So I hate to call that a trend. I think it's promising in the sense that I do think we've removed some friction in some of the changes that we made on the partner front. We've removed friction for direct reps wanting to leverage partners than what we had in the past. I think we now have this partner economic model that provides more certainty in what they're going to get paid. And then I'd say there is other work that the new partner leader is driving around developing teaming agreements for partners and actually having very specific plans for partners. I'd say our approach to partners before was a bit of one size fits all. And I think we've navigated to a much better place that partners are different, how you manage and work with GSIs are different than how you work with hyperscale is different than how you work with regional partners. So I'd say we've made a lot of changes. And I'd say the early proof points are that we are getting traction, but I think we need a little bit more time to see whether or not that this continues to play out. Our next question comes from the line of Jake Roberge with William Blair. Great to hear the example of the large expansion for that Grail the logs on rail customer. I know most the customers are landing with logs or just moving new workloads over to Dynatrace today. But for that type of subset of customers that are actually starting to rip and replace competing solutions, how large is that uplift for the platform? And how long does that typical migration process take to get fully up and running? So I'll take that. I think it varies. I think we've talked before, in particular for logs that there's usually a journey with logs where they start with the POC, then assuming that's successful, starch was lighter workloads in production and bigger workloads in production and then you're moving existing. I think it varies based on customer and the pain point they're having with their existing log supplier. And so you can ramp up pretty quickly that -- so there's no scaling challenge on our part being able to do that. I think it's just a customer's ability to move and desire to move. So it varies by customer. What's great about, as I mentioned, our DPS contracting vehicle, it just allows customers to trial a bunch of things. And in that case, they were able to trial it before because they were a DPS customer. And for that particular customer, I don't recall how long they were trialing our log solution, but they can ramp up pretty quickly when they do that. And I'd say the more and more we can get customers on vehicles like that, you can then leverage our customer success teams and our services teams in helping customers in the journey around the different offerings we have. Jake, I would just add to the answer to say that our logs consumption onto grow very nicely. It's well above 100% year-over-year in terms of consumption growth. So that's an exciting metric to watch. And we do see the kind of traction that we're expecting on the log front out of grant. Our next question comes from the line of Fatima Bolani with Citi. This is for both Rick and Jim. I wanted to zero in on the new logo acquisition in the quarter. So that was up 5% year-on-year, I believe. And I think that snaps trends we've seen in the last couple of quarters where we've had new local growth down. I wanted to get your sense of what has been the contributing force for that sort of return to growth, especially in the first quarter? And what are some of the specific and maybe more deliberate efforts and initiatives you're seeking to continue to rehabilitate new logo growth? Thank you for the question. Yes, we are very pleased with our new logo traction. I think we've mentioned before that new logo units are going to vary a bit from quarter-to-quarter, just the nature of kind of pipeline. But we were pleased. We had roughly 162, I think, new logos in the quarter. You're right, up 5%. And I'd say more notably is we really are focusing, and I said this on multiple calls, we're really focusing on the quality of the new logo lands. We have found that if you land north of $100,000 on average, those customers expand at a much more rapid clip. So it isn't just a number of new logos, even though we're pleased with the number. It's also we want to make sure we're landing them at the right size. It just that's equally important. And so I'd say there are certainly plays. The plays that I outlined before that the sales team is running is they're very similar that in many cases, you could be landing with an application owner, and you do a POC and they have a need for a particular workload being monitored. And in other cases, it's a customer that we mentioned last quarter, a very large global airline that we won a new logo for that was not a Dynatrace customer and literally we landed a tool consolidation deal. We weren't even 1 of the vendors. And so it does vary, which is why I talk a little bit about -- while I'm happy with the number of units, I'm actually more focused on the quality of the units. And it's part of the sales plays. We still expect [indiscernible] about 30% of our net new ARR to come from new logos and about 70% from expansions, give or take a point or 2. So it's -- I think what we want is we want to motion that continues to attract new customers. We have over 4,000 customers today. However, we've targeted the top 15,000 global companies. So we have a lot of runway to go as well. So it's a motion that we're going to continue to refine. I think some of the partner work that we're doing, once we see that manifest itself with additional traction, you're going to be able to have partners drive more new logos for us as well. Just to connect the dots, Fatima, I would say that we see new logo lands in each of the sales use cases that I discussed in the prepared remarks. We see it in land and expand. We see it at end-to-end observability. We see it in cloud modernization. And these are the sales use cases or go-to-market use cases that we have the team focused on. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Tindle with Raymond James. I wanted to ask a question on net new ARR. Looking at the financial data table. It grew over 20% in Q1, and congrats on that. For the rest of the year, I understand you're not updating today and that makes sense. So it's on us to set expectations. But as I try to level set for rest of the year on net new ARR. If we were to maintain this, we'd be tracking down double digits year-over-year in the remaining quarters. Curious why that would be a reasonable assumption for now. And I'm asking because I understand the sales changes are potentially impacting you, but it sounds like you made those -- or those were done in April. Would there be something that would cause more impact from here on that. And secondly, maybe you could touch on the state of the pipeline. I'm wondering if maybe some large deals are reflected here in Q1 that may have impacted the rest of the year from a pipeline perspective. So Adam, it's a very fair question. I wouldn't read anything into the guide for the remainder of the year. You're absolutely right. We had a very solid start to the year. Net new ARR in constant currency was up 23%. So no doubt, a good start to the year. And then your comment is fair if you just do kind of the math or does that imply that we're worried about the back half of the year? And the answer is no. We just -- for simplicity, we said we're not going to increase the guidance this quarter, that is, call it, 18% of the way through the year. We certainly are -- we said we're going to maintain it. I think we tried to convey qualitatively in our remarks that we are bullish on the opportunities in front of us. But we want to maintain a level of prudence in our approach here that it still is a choppy market. And we want to make sure that we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. And so that's -- I wouldn't read any more into it other than that. And I would say we are quite bullish, though, on the opportunities that are in front of us. The pipeline still remains healthy. Demand environment remains healthy. To Rick's point, I think the recent outages are a reminder to customers that they need to have an ability to detect issues and hopefully prevent issues. Our solution is purpose-built for that in the enterprise. So we're very optimistic about the opportunities. I'd say we just guided a little bit that we want to make sure we're prudent in the near term. Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Congratulations as well. So when you look at the old formula of new customer growth plus existing customer growth, I think it was 15% to 20% each potentially 30% to 40%. That was kind of the aspirational target. As you look at the improvements in DPS and the changes to go-to-market coverage and expanded product footprint, when do you think we could get back to the old formula of adding that 15 to 20 points each from new customers and existing customers, the path to reacceleration? What does that look like? Thanks, Kash. Thanks for getting up early for us. In terms of sort of long-term guidance, I'm not going to provide any update on that. What I would simply say is that our expectation during the worth of the year is that we stabilized ARR growth for this year, and then we increase it in the future. which we expect elements like go-to-market changes such as customer segmentation, partner lean in, some of the other elements around use cases the movement toward end-to-end observability. We believe all of these elements contribute to acceleration both in new logos as well as NRR. And so the expectation is that we are leaning in. We have a market that is coming our way, the end-to-end absorbability opportunity is substantial. We believe that our platform plays better to that than any other competitors in our industry, and we're focused doing precisely what we suggested in an effort to drive toward the objectives that you outlined of increased growth. Our next question comes from the line of Koji Ikeda with Bank of America. I wanted to circle back to AppSec and logs. And the question is around how did it go with App second logs as contributors to growth in the fiscal first quarter? Any update to the consumption trends with these 2 emerging solutions. Did the consumption come in as expected, maybe better than expected, do you realize this $100 million milestone for those 2 products are somewhat of a moving target, but did it move much after this quarter? Yes, I'd say that, again, we had very good consumption in Q1 in both logs and application security. Logs is growing faster than application security, which is not surprising given the nature of logs and how customers leverage logs given the journey that I mentioned. But we're very pleased with the growth rates that we ended Q4 in and that we continued with in Q1. So I'd say no real change in those particular areas. Those areas continue to grow at a very rapid rate. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. I first wanted to acknowledge that DBNR certainly was better than we were thinking even if it was only up modestly. And I did want to drill down on that a bit. And so I know, Rick, you mentioned your target is 70-30 in terms of existing versus new logo. If we superimpose either the net retention rate in the last fiscal year on the net new ARR, it looked like it was closer to was existing customers, if not a little bit below. And I'm just trying to understand while the net retention rate was certainly better than we were thinking. It still is a relatively subdued number if we think about the breadth of software. And so I'm just thinking about is, a, is it more a reflection of market dynamics in that customers in the markets you serve are prioritizing other areas even at a 112 Will there be specific factors impacting Dynatrace and so something I asked about last quarter. If you could talk a little bit about price. Is there share leakage for open source solutions for more commodity workloads or anything on the competitive dynamics more broadly that's impacting that 112 number. That would be great. And just -- I guess, just to finish the thought is you mentioned that, I think you said, Jim, that you thought a net retention rate could be flattish from these levels? I just want to confirm that I heard that correctly and what would be helping or hurting as we should think about over the next couple of quarters? I know that's a lot. Yes, I'll start and then maybe Rick can comment. So I didn't mean to imply that I thought it would be flat from the current levels. Actually, if you look at the guide, the guy would actually suggest that it will moderate from here. So I do want to be clear on that. My point is, I do think our goal is to stabilize NRR this year. And we think that DPS as a contracting vehicle, is a great way to have customers leverage more of the platform, which will be a kind of one of the catalysts for that. Obviously, you have to have the products, which we think we do, to be able to fuel that. So just to clarify on that. But your observation is fair. I would say where we're at is there has been a moderation in NRR over time. You got to stabilize before you accelerate. I would say relative to the demand environment, the demand environment is healthy. However, when you look at existing customers, maybe versus new logos, what does -- existing customers tend to do an expansion close to a renewal period. That's just the nature of how customers operate. And so expansions tend to coincide very closely with a renewal or close to a renewal. So there's going to be a level of variability of when expansions happen. And because we don't have a huge renewal component in the first quarter, I'd say there's only -- even if you have significant expansion for those customers in the quarter, it's not going to move the metric in a material way just because you don't have the volume of renewal activity. So I'd say more in the back half of the year, we have a much more substantive set of renewal activity in Q3 and Q4, that our expectation is if we continue to see traction and consumption grow at these trends that we could be in a good position for expansion. Again, we're being cautious. But Hopefully, that provides a little bit of color. And Rick, I don't know if you have anything else to offer. Just on the open source point, Keith, I would say we haven't really seen any price pressure to speak of from open source at this juncture. And just, Rick, broadly, is there pricing pressure on incremental pricing pressure on the markets you serve, whether it's ATM, infra, what have you? No. I would say, generally not, Keith. It is obviously in a deal specific -- on a deal-specific basis, you can periodically see it. But in a broader sense, I would say no. Yes. So just to close out our call all a great start to FY '25 with Q1. We're very enthusiastic about the balance of the year and in particular, as we look to the opportunity to land these go-to-market changes and drive toward the second half of the year. We absolutely believe the market is playing to our strengths in end-to-end observability and the benefits that it provides in terms of productivity, cost containment and end user experience. And we look forward to speaking with you all on the road this quarter. Thanks very much for joining. And this concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time.
